    "Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid.": [
        "Once such risks materialise, as is expected at very high risk levels, the impacts would persist even if global temperatures would subsequently decline to levels associated with lower levels of risk in an ‘overshooting’ scenario (high confidence).",
        "That judgement refers to impacts that exceed the threshold for severity considered here, suggesting that global warming of 4°C would produce severe risks to peace under present societal conditions .",
        "A low-likelihood, high-impact outcome would be several large eruptions that would greatly alter the 21st century climate trajectory compared to SSP-based Earth system model projections."

    "Most likely the primary control knob [on climate change] is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.": [
        "Human-induced greenhouse gas forcing is the main driver of the observed changes in hot and cold extremes on the global scale (virtually certain ) and on most continents (very likely ).",
        "But biodiversity changes, warming, acidification and non-climate drivers .",
        "Climate regulation by the ocean depends on physical and biogeochemical processes ."

    "'Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.": [
        "Since then, increased warming and progressively more conclusive attribution studies have identified human activities as the ‘dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century’ .",
        "Trust in experts, institutions and environmental groups is also important Rhetoric and misinformation on climate change and the deliberate undermining of science have contributed to misperceptions of the scientific consensus, uncertainty, disregarded risk and urgency, and dissent .",
        "Despite expert scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, there is polarisation and an ongoing debate over the reality of anthropogenic climate change in the public and policy domains, with attendant risks to society ."

    "Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.": [
        "The GCMs and ESMs compared in CMIP6 The FAR concluded that while both theory and models suggested that anthropogenic warming was already well underway, its signal could not yet be detected in observational data against the ‘noise’ of natural variability .",
        "The AR5 did not include an assessment of large-scale temperature estimates for the MH, although it assigned high confidence to the long-term cooling trend over mid- to high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere and likely the warmest 30-year period of the past 1.4 kyr based on a quality-controlled, multi-proxy synthesis of paleo-temperature records from 470 terrestrial and 209 marine sites globally indicates that the median GMST of the warmest two-century-long interval was 0.7 °C warmer than 1800–1900 , and was centred around 6.5 ka.",
        "This assessed change in temperature before 1850–1900 is not included in the AR6 assessment of global warming to date, to ensure consistency with previous IPCC assessment reports, and because of the lower confidence in the estimate."

    "Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.": [
        "It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger by the end of the 21st century in a pathway with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.",
        "The RCP and SSP scenarios, which form the basis for climate projections assessed in this Report, are designed to span a plausible range of future pathways , and the amplitude of changes in solar activity, before satellite observations.",
        "In an RCP8.5 scenario, Wild et al conservatively calculate a global reduction of 1% per decade between 2005 and 2049 for future solar power production changes due to changing solar resources as a result of global warming and decreasing all-sky radiation over the coming decades."
