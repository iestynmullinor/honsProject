        "The latter emphasises the central role of structures of power and production, and a commitment to economic growth and capital accumulation in relation to climate action, given the historically central role of fossil fuels to economic development and the deep embedding of fossil energy in daily life The economic centrality of fossil fuels raises obvious questions regarding the possibility of decarbonisation.",

        "During severe bleaching events, not only do reefs lose a significant amount of live coral cover, but they also experience a decrease in growth potential, and thus reef erosion surpasses reef accretion .",
        "In the 1990s when global warming was around 0.7\u00b0C large-scale coral reef bleaching also became apparent ; however, there is low agreement on the nature of the thresholds and the associated tipping points.",
