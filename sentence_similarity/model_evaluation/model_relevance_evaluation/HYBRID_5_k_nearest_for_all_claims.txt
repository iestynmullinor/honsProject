    "Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.": [
        "It is likely that tropical upper tropospheric warming will be larger than at the tropical surface, but with an uncertain magnitude owing to the effects of natural internal variability and uncertainty in the response of the climate system to anthropogenic forcing.",
        "There is no model consensus for a systematic change in intensity of ENSO sea surface temperature variability over the 21st century in any of the SSP scenarios assessed (medium confidence).",
        "The rate of Arctic surface warming will continue to exceed the global average over this century (high confidence)."

    "Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.": [
        "In such situations, the need for active cooling technologies may arise, along with higher energy consumption and GHG emissions Changes in cloud formation can affect global solar irradiation and, therefore, the output of solar photovoltaic panels, possibly affecting on-site renewable energy production .",
        "In an RCP8.5 scenario, Wild et al conservatively calculate a global reduction of 1% per decade between 2005 and 2049 for future solar power production changes due to changing solar resources as a result of global warming and decreasing all-sky radiation over the coming decades.",
        "In the next two decades, it is very likely that the SLCF emissions changes in the WGI core set of SSPs will cause a warming relative to 2019, whatever the SSPs, in addition to the warming from long-lived greenhouse gases."
