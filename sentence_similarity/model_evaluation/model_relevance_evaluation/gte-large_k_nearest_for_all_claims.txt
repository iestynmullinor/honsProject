        "While this causes global mean temperature to decline, changes in climate have not fully reversed by 2100 under this reversal of CO2 concentration of the same average CO2.",
        "The AR6 WGI assessed the reduction in global surface temperature to be approximately linearly related to cumulative CO2 removal and, with lower confidence, that the amount of cooling per unit CO2 removed is approximately independent of the rate and amount of removal .",

        "The 20 ppm gradual increase of atmospheric CO2 starting 7 ka has been attributed to a decrease in natural terrestrial biomass due to climate change, carbonate compensation and enhanced shallow water carbonate deposition , consistent with stable carbon isotope measurements on CO2 extracted from Antarctic ice .",
        "In summary, multiple lines of observational and modelling evidence provide high confidence in the finding that the ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2 has increased quasi-linearly over the past 60 years in response to growing global emissions of anthropogenic CO2, with a mean fraction of 23% of total emissions.",
        "Records of CO2 from the AIS formed during the last glacial period and the LDT show century-scale fluctuations of up to 9.6 ppm .",
