        "While this causes global mean temperature to decline, changes in climate have not fully reversed by 2100 under this reversal of CO2 concentration of the same average CO2.",
        "Furthermore, Buchholz et al report a slowdown in global CO decline in 2010–2018 compared to 2002–2010, although the magnitude and sign of this change in the trend varies regionally.",
        "The report also found that Arctic sea ice extent has very likely decreased for all months of the year since 1979 and that September sea ice reductions of 12.8 ± 2.3% per decade are likely unprecedented for at least 1000 years."

        "Significantly, climate change will add to already existing vulnerabilities.",
        "A low-likelihood, high-impact outcome would be several large eruptions that would greatly alter the 21st century climate trajectory compared to SSP-based Earth system model projections.",
        "That judgement refers to impacts that exceed the threshold for severity considered here, suggesting that global warming of 4°C would produce severe risks to peace under present societal conditions ."

    "Most likely the primary control knob [on climate change] is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.": [
        "It also interacts with the response of the climate system to external forcing.",
        "The dominant human influence on observed global warming and related water cycle changes was confirmed.",
        "In summary, greenhouse gas forcing is the dominant driver leading to the warming of temperature extremes."

    "'Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.": [
        "The sheer volume of published, peer-reviewed literature on climate change presents a challenge to comprehensive, robust and transparent assessment.",
        "Temperatures averaged over land areas globally have warmed by 1.59 °C from 1850–1900 to 2011–2020, substantially higher than the SST warming of 0.88 °C.",
        "This occurs despite increasing consensus among journalists regarding the basic scientific understanding of climate change Accurate transference of the climate science has been undermined significantly by climate change counter-movements, particularly in the USA in both legacy and new/social media environments through misinformation , including about the causes and consequences of climate change ."

    "Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.": [
        "The AR5 assessed with very high confidence that climate models reproduce the general features of the global-scale annual mean surface temperature increase over the historical period, including the more rapid warming in the second half of the 20th century, and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions.",
        "Mean air temperature: New literature confirms a continuous warming since the beginning of the 20th century in the majority of the eight sub-regions .",

    "Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.": [
        "It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger by the end of the 21st century in a pathway with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.",
        "For example, projected changes in the solar cycle include long-term modulation rather than a repeating solar cycle .",
        "Recent studies show that very ambitious but plausible gradual phasing out of fossil fuels in 1.5°C-compatible pathways with little or no overshoot, lead to a near-term future warming of less than 0.1°C, when considering associated emissions reduction of both warming and cooling species."
