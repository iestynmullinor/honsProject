        "Furthermore, Buchholz et al report a slowdown in global CO decline in 2010\u20132018 compared to 2002\u20132010, although the magnitude and sign of this change in the trend varies regionally.",
        "An increase of global CO burden of about 50% for the year 2000 relative to 1850 is found in CMIP6 The AR5 reported a global CO decline of about 1% yr\u20131based on satellite data from 2002\u20132010, but biases in instruments rendered low confidence in this trend.",
        "There is a near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and the increase in global mean surface air temperature is due to a better integration of evidence across the science in this assessment.",

        "The 20 ppm gradual increase of atmospheric CO2 starting 7 ka has been attributed to a decrease in natural terrestrial biomass due to climate change, carbonate compensation and enhanced shallow water carbonate deposition , consistent with stable carbon isotope measurements on CO2 extracted from Antarctic ice .",

        "These changes have been predominantly ascribed to the impact of changes in the MOC on the transport of anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean interior due to regional climate variability, in addition to the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration .",
        "Based on the airborne fraction (AF), it is concluded with medium confidence that both ocean and land CO2 sinks have grown consistent with the rising of anthropogenic emissions.",
