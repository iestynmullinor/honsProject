        "That judgement refers to impacts that exceed the threshold for severity considered here, suggesting that global warming of 4°C would produce severe risks to peace under present societal conditions .",
        "Under higher emissions scenarios and increasing climate hazards, the potential for social tipping points increases (medium confidence)."

    "Most likely the primary control knob [on climate change] is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.": [
        "It also interacts with the response of the climate system to external forcing.",
        "The dominant human influence on observed global warming and related water cycle changes was confirmed.",
        "Human influence has been a major driver of regional mean temperature change since 1950 in many sub-continental regions of the world (virtually certain)."

    "'Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.": [
        "This occurs despite increasing consensus among journalists regarding the basic scientific understanding of climate change Accurate transference of the climate science has been undermined significantly by climate change counter-movements, particularly in the USA in both legacy and new/social media environments through misinformation , including about the causes and consequences of climate change .",
        "Despite expert scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, there is polarisation and an ongoing debate over the reality of anthropogenic climate change in the public and policy domains, with attendant risks to society .",
        "The same applies to other sources of climate information."

    "Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.": [
        "Mean air temperature: New literature confirms a continuous warming since the beginning of the 20th century in the majority of the eight sub-regions .",
        "The multi-model mean captures most aspects of observed climate change well (high confidence).",
        "The rate of Arctic surface warming will continue to exceed the global average over this century (high confidence)."

    "Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.": [
        "It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger by the end of the 21st century in a pathway with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.",
        "Changes in solar radiation as a consequence of solar dimming and brightening may affect trends .",
        "Over time scales of 10 to 20 years, the global temperature response to a year’s worth of current emissions of SLCFs is at least as large as that due to a year’s worth of CO2 emissions would not only alleviate this warming but would turn this into a cooling of 0.07°C with a likely range of °C ."
