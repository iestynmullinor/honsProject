        "A substantial fraction of the damage from hurricane Harvey’s extreme rainfall has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change .",
        "However, first studies do not only quantify the change in occurrence probabilities but translate the actual change in climate-related systems into the additional area affected by flooding in a process-based way to damages induced by Hurricane Sandy; Wehner and Sampson, 2021 for the contribution increased precipitation to damages induced by Hurricane Harvey) and attribute a considerable part of the observed damage to anthropogenic climate forcing.",
        "Recent studies conclude that climate change can increase the severity and intensity of crises or even trigger disasters, particularly floods, storms, forest and wildfires, and droughts."

    "The IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is sort of the voice of the consensus, concedes that there has been no increase in extreme weather events.": [
        "There was high confidence that global warming was already causing an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events, impacting ecosystems, food security, disturbances and production processes, with existing .",
        "In a changing climate, people frequently ask whether extreme events are generally becoming more severe or more frequent, and whether an actual extreme event was caused by climate change.",
        "This report shows that past and future climate changes and extreme weather events can be substantial on local and regional scales Although the evolution of global climate trends emerges as the net result of regional phenomena, average or aggregate estimates often do not reflect the intensity, variability and complexity of regional climate changes ."

    "according, again, to the official figures—during this past 10 years, if anything, mean global temperature, average world temperature, has slightly declined": [
        "These differences have also been observed in former years That means, even moderate changes in the global mean temperature, as identified in the recent IPCC report SR1.5°C and in scientific literature , can mean substantial increases in risks for more than 3 billion people due to high levels of vulnerability.",
        "For the period 2006–2015, observed global mean surface temperature .",
        "Over the past two decades, Arctic Ocean surface temperature has increased in line with the global average, while there has been no uniform warming across the Antarctic ."

    "Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid.": [
        "The highest increase of temperature of hottest days is projected in some mid-latitude and semi-arid regions and in the South American Monsoon region, at about 1.5 times to twice the rate of global warming (high confidence).",
        "Relative to present-day conditions, changes in the intensity of extremes would be at least double at 2°C, and quadruple at 3°C of global warming, compared to changes at 1.5°C of global warming.",
        "Children born in 2020, under a 1.5°C-compatible scenario will be exposed to 4–6 times more heatwaves in their lifetimes compared to people born in 1960; this exposure increases to 9–10 times more heatwaves for emission reduction pledges, limiting global warming to 2.4°C ."

    "Most likely the primary control knob [on climate change] is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.": [
        "Climate change is having major impacts on the region’s oceans .",
        "In summary, climate change is one of the key drivers of the loss and degradation of freshwater ecosystems and the unprecedented decline and extinction of many freshwater-dependent populations.",
        "Climate has three important impacts on the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 : ; ; and ."

    "'Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.": [
        "Observations of climate changeThe SR1.5 estimated with high confidence that human activities caused a global warming of approximately 1°C between the 1850–1900 period and 2017.",
        "Since then, thousands of new studies and additional species have been added, leading to higher confidence in climate change attribution .",
        "Since then, increased warming and progressively more conclusive attribution studies have identified human activities as the ‘dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century’ ."
    ],
    "Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.": [
        "It is therefore deemed more likely than not that these estimates based on post-1970s global warming are biased low by internal variability.",
        "The rate of Arctic surface warming will continue to exceed the global average over this century (high confidence).",
        "This assessed change in temperature before 1850–1900 is not included in the AR6 assessment of global warming to date, to ensure consistency with previous IPCC assessment reports, and because of the lower confidence in the estimate."

    "Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.": [
        "It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger by the end of the 21st century in a pathway with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.",
        "Global climate model simulations show that solar panels induce regional cooling by converting part of the incoming solar energy to electricity .",
        "Climate change is not expected to substantially impact global solar insolation and will not compromise the ability of solar energy to support low-carbon transitions ."
