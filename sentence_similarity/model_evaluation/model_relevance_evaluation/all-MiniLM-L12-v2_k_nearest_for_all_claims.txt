        "Some literature exists comparing previous IPCC projections to what has unfolded over the subsequent decades , and recent work has confirmed that climate models since around 1970 have projected global surface warming in reasonable agreement with observations once the difference between assumed and actual forcing has been taken into account ."

        "This assessed change in temperature before 1850–1900 is not included in the AR6 assessment of global warming to date, to ensure consistency with previous IPCC assessment reports, and because of the lower confidence in the estimate.",

        "Conceptually, the literature suggests that the small lag of about a decade between CO2 emissions and temperature change would result in more warming at a given amount of cumulative emissions in a scenario where that emissions level is first exceeded and then returned to by deploying negative emissions .",
        "Capabilities for observing the physical climate system have continued to improve and expand overall, but some reductions in observational capacity are also evident emissions and CO2 emissions remaining around current levels until the middle of the century; and scenarios with very low and low GHG emissions and CO2 emissions declining to net zero around or after 2050, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6)."
