        "It shows the number of media science stories in those sources grew steadily from 47,376 per annum to 86,587 per annum between 2017 and 2021 across print, broadcast, digital media and entertainment However, increasing media coverage does not always lead to more accurate coverage of climate change mitigation, as it can also spur diffusion of misinformation .",
        "This occurs despite increasing consensus among journalists regarding the basic scientific understanding of climate change Accurate transference of the climate science has been undermined significantly by climate change counter-movements, particularly in the USA in both legacy and new/social media environments through misinformation , including about the causes and consequences of climate change .",

        "This assessed change in temperature before 1850–1900 is not included in the AR6 assessment of global warming to date, to ensure consistency with previous IPCC assessment reports, and because of the lower confidence in the estimate.",
        "It is therefore deemed more likely than not that these estimates based on post-1970s global warming are biased low by internal variability.",
        "Because only one realization of the actual climate exists, it is non-trivial to extract estimates of internal and forced variability from the available data ."

        "It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger by the end of the 21st century in a pathway with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.",
        "Capabilities for observing the physical climate system have continued to improve and expand overall, but some reductions in observational capacity are also evident emissions and CO2 emissions remaining around current levels until the middle of the century; and scenarios with very low and low GHG emissions and CO2 emissions declining to net zero around or after 2050, followed by varying levels of net negative CO2 emissions (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6).",
        "For the near-term, a transition of PDV from the negative phase towards a positive phase is predicted in the coming years The PDV has been shown to influence the pace of global warming remains an open question, and there is still no robust evidence."
