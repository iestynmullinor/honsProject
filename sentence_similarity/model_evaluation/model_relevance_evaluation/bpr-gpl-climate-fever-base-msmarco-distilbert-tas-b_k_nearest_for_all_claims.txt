    "Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.": [
        "Although these rates are an order of magnitude lower than those directly observed over 1919–2019 CE .",

        "The rate of Arctic surface warming will continue to exceed the global average over this century (high confidence)."

    "Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.": [
        "Globally, low climate change projections, versus higher climate change projections, imply greater mitigation, lower climate risks and less adaptation.",
        "The former refers to a short-term rise in emissions in response to climate policy, while the latter refers to rising cumulative damage.",
        "Projected changes in wind and solar potential are uncertain; the trends vary by region and season ."
