        "Warming and wetting have persisted as key climatic impact drivers in polar regions with cascading climate effects regarding heatwaves, fire, weather, floods and heavy precipitation, river runoff, snowfall, glaciers and ice sheets and the Polar Regions chapter in the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate .",
        "Future climate-induced changes in the polar oceans, sea ice, snow and permafrost will drive habitat and biome shifts, with associated changes in the ranges and abundance of ecologically important species .",
        "As a result, keeping a cooler average global temperature will lead to lower extinction risks.",
        "Reductions of winter severity attributed to anthropogenic climate change are increasing winter algal biomass, and motile and phototropic species, at the expense of mixotrophic species Tropical lakes are prone to loss of deep-water oxygen due to lake warming, with negative consequences for their fisheries and their biodiversity .",
        "In some cases, a warmer climate could lead to extinction of species."

    "The sun has gone into lockdown which could cause freezing weather, earthquakes and famine, say scientists": [
        "Freezing rain and ice storms can be treacherous for road and air travel , and can knock down power and telecommunication lines if ice accumulation is high .",
        "Freezing rain is also a risk to urban populations and infrastructure.",
        "Power outages triggered by floods or droughts have also been found to have substantial health implications, particularly among low-income populations , and shown to impede disaster recovery efforts and severely disrupt local economies .",
        "Most of these impacts have been associated with drought, monsoon rain and oceanic oscillations, the frequency and severity of which have been linked with the changing climate .",
        "There is robust evidence that floods and droughts have, mainly through adverse impacts on agriculture ."

    "The polar bear population has been growing.": [
        "Between 2015 and 2020, urban populations globally have grown by about 397 million people, with more than 90% of this growth taking place in less developed countries .",
        "Some cities have experienced population decline in recent years.",
        "In all other regions, they were growing \u2013 most rapidly in southern Asia .",

    "Ironic' study finds more CO2 has slightly cooled the planet": [
        "Some feedbacks are accounted for through the non-CO2 warming estimate (Section 5.5.2.2.5), while the remainder combines to reduce the median remaining carbon budget estimates for 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C of warming by about 10 to 20 GtCO2, respectively, compared to SR1.5.",
        "As one of the most commonly observed surface parameters, the partial pressure of CO2 has been the topic of considerable detection and attribution work.",
        "The 20 ppm gradual increase of atmospheric CO2 starting 7 ka has been attributed to a decrease in natural terrestrial biomass due to climate change, carbonate compensation and enhanced shallow water carbonate deposition , consistent with stable carbon isotope measurements on CO2 extracted from Antarctic ice .",
        "This finding implies that continued emissions of CO2 will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system, independent of any specific scenario or pathway.",
        "For example, in a cool temperate grassland experiment, warming led to a longer growing season and elevated CO2 further extended growing by conserving water, which enabled most species to remain active longer ."

    "Human additions of CO2 are in the margin of error of current measurements and the gradual increase in CO2 is mainly from oceans degassing as the planet slowly emerges from the last ice age.": [
        "The 20 ppm gradual increase of atmospheric CO2 starting 7 ka has been attributed to a decrease in natural terrestrial biomass due to climate change, carbonate compensation and enhanced shallow water carbonate deposition , consistent with stable carbon isotope measurements on CO2 extracted from Antarctic ice .",
        "Fossil fuels are devoid of14C and therefore fossil fuel-derived CO2 additions decrease the atmospheric14C/12C ratio Over the past six decades, the fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions that has accumulated in the atmosphere .",

    "They tell us that we are the primary forces controlling earth temperatures by the burning of fossil fuels and releasing their carbon dioxide.": [
        "The latter emphasises the central role of structures of power and production, and a commitment to economic growth and capital accumulation in relation to climate action, given the historically central role of fossil fuels to economic development and the deep embedding of fossil energy in daily life The economic centrality of fossil fuels raises obvious questions regarding the possibility of decarbonisation.",
        "Given their carbon content, if used as fuels, their carbon will eventually be oxidised and emitted as CO2 to the atmosphere.",
        "For the role of weather and climate extremes on the global water cycle, see In summary, with ongoing climate warming and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, observed increases in water temperature, losses of ice and shifts in thermal regime are projected to continue (high confidence).",
        "At large scales the dominant effect of aerosols on the carbon cycle is likely a global cooling effect of the climate .",
        "At the same time, the domestic consumption of fossil fuels is anticipated to increase in response to the drop in external demand that would provoke carbon leakage ."

    "The Great Barrier Reef is experiencing the most widespread bleaching ever recorded": [
        "While coral bleaching is a visible symptom of heat stress, warming has also induced restructuring of associated fish and invertebrate communities in the Great Barrier Reef Although the number of coral species that are both exposed and vulnerable to climate hazards is greatest in the central Indo-Pacific, the proportion of corals at risk is greater in the lower diversity Caribbean hotspots .",
        "In the 1990s when global warming was around 0.7\u00b0C large-scale coral reef bleaching also became apparent ; however, there is low agreement on the nature of the thresholds and the associated tipping points.",
        "Severe coral bleaching, together with declines in coral abundance have been documented in many small islands, especially those in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean .",
        "Extreme climatic events in Australia from 2011 to 2017 led to abrupt and extensive mortality of key habitat-forming organisms \u2014 corals, kelps, seagrasses and mangroves \u2014 along over 45% of the continental coastline of Australia In 2016 and 2017, the GBR experienced consecutive occurrences of the most severe coral bleaching in recorded history .",

    "If CO2 was so terrible for the planet, then installing a CO2 generator in a greenhouse would kill the plants.": [
        "Higher atmospheric CO2 favours plant growth if soil quality and condition are sufficient, but benefits can be offset by increased heat and water stress associated with climate change .",
        "Increasing CO2 is expected to increase yields, but only where other factors, such as warming, do not become yield-limiting .",
        "However, CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and reducing emissions of other greenhouse gases (GHGs) alongside CO2 towards net zero emissions of all GHGs would lower the level at which global temperature would peak.",
        "This finding implies that continued emissions of CO2 will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system, independent of any specific scenario or pathway.",
        "Higher CO2 reduces the nutritional density of crops and forage lands and can increase the production of toxins and allergenic pollen ."
