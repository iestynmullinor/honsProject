    "'Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.": [
        "Notably, after mid-2018, global media showed a large increase number of mentions of ‘global warming’, ‘climate change’ and similar terms .",
        "The global trends reviewed above are based on data from 2000 studies.",
        "For the period 2006–2015, observed global mean surface temperature ."
    ],
    "Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.": [
        "Although these rates are an order of magnitude lower than those directly observed over 1919–2019 CE .",
        "Since the late 19th century, major modes of climate variability show no sustained trends but do exhibit fluctuations in frequency and magnitude at inter-decadal time scales, with the notable exception of the Southern Annular Mode, which has become systematically more positive .",
        "Temperatures have increased faster over land than over the oceans since 1850–1900, with warming to 2011–2020 of 1.59 °C versus 0.88 °C, respectively."
    ],
    "Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.": [
        "For example, projected changes in the solar cycle include long-term modulation rather than a repeating solar cycle .",
        "Globally, low climate change projections, versus higher climate change projections, imply greater mitigation, lower climate risks and less adaptation.",
        "The former refers to a short-term rise in emissions in response to climate policy, while the latter refers to rising cumulative damage."
