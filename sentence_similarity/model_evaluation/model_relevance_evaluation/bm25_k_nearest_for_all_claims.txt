        "In the next two decades, it is very likely that the SLCF emissions changes in the WGI core set of SSPs will cause a warming relative to 2019, whatever the SSPs, in addition to the warming from long-lived greenhouse gases.",
        "Land clathrates are formed at depths greater than 200 m , which precludes a substantial response to global warming over the next few centuries and associated emissions.",
        "In such situations, the need for active cooling technologies may arise, along with higher energy consumption and GHG emissions Changes in cloud formation can affect global solar irradiation and, therefore, the output of solar photovoltaic panels, possibly affecting on-site renewable energy production ."
