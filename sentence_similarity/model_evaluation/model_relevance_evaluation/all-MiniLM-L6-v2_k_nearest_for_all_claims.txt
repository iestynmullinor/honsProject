        "It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger by the end of the 21st century in a pathway with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.",

        "Modelling studies consistently show that, relative to a high-CO2 world without SRM, SRM-induced cooling .",
        "There is a near-linear relationship between cumulative CO2 emissions and the increase in global mean surface air temperature is due to a better integration of evidence across the science in this assessment."

    "Human additions of CO2 are in the margin of error of current measurements and the gradual increase in CO2 is mainly from oceans degassing as the planet slowly emerges from the last ice age.": [
        "In summary, multiple lines of observational and modelling evidence provide high confidence in the finding that the ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2 has increased quasi-linearly over the past 60 years in response to growing global emissions of anthropogenic CO2, with a mean fraction of 23% of total emissions.",
        "The 20 ppm gradual increase of atmospheric CO2 starting 7 ka has been attributed to a decrease in natural terrestrial biomass due to climate change, carbonate compensation and enhanced shallow water carbonate deposition , consistent with stable carbon isotope measurements on CO2 extracted from Antarctic ice .",

        "Severe coral bleaching, together with declines in coral abundance have been documented in many small islands, especially those in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean .",
        "During severe bleaching events, not only do reefs lose a significant amount of live coral cover, but they also experience a decrease in growth potential, and thus reef erosion surpasses reef accretion .",
        "Mass coral bleaching in the western Indian Ocean occurred in 1998, 2005, 2010 and 2015/2016 with coral cover just 30\u201340% of 1998 levels by 2016 .",
