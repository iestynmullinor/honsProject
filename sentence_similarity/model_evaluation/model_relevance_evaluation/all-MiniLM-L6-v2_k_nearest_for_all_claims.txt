    "'Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.": [
        "While various studies have described increasing trends in several heatwave metrics , few recent studies have explicitly attributed these changes to causes; most of them stated that observed trends are consistent with anthropogenic warming.",
        "Notably, after mid-2018, global media showed a large increase number of mentions of ‘global warming’, ‘climate change’ and similar terms .",
        "The AR5 concluded that ‘it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century’ ."

    "Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.": [
        "It is therefore deemed more likely than not that these estimates based on post-1970s global warming are biased low by internal variability.",
        "However, even though warming from anthropogenic emissions will persist for centuries to millennia and will cause ongoing long-term changes, past emissions alone are unlikely to raise global surface temperature to 1.5°C above 1850–1900 levels.",
        "This assessed change in temperature before 1850–1900 is not included in the AR6 assessment of global warming to date, to ensure consistency with previous IPCC assessment reports, and because of the lower confidence in the estimate."

    "Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.": [
        "It is very likely that global mean stratospheric cooling will be larger by the end of the 21st century in a pathway with higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations.",
        "Some literature exists comparing previous IPCC projections to what has unfolded over the subsequent decades , and recent work has confirmed that climate models since around 1970 have projected global surface warming in reasonable agreement with observations once the difference between assumed and actual forcing has been taken into account .",
        "The RCP and SSP scenarios, which form the basis for climate projections assessed in this Report, are designed to span a plausible range of future pathways , and the amplitude of changes in solar activity, before satellite observations."
