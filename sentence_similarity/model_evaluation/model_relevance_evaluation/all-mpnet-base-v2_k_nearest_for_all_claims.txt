        "Because really extreme events occur rarely was three to ten times more likely as the result of climate change."

    "according, again, to the official figures—during this past 10 years, if anything, mean global temperature, average world temperature, has slightly declined": [
        "Mean air temperature: New literature confirms a continuous warming since the beginning of the 20th century in the majority of the eight sub-regions .",
        "Temperatures averaged over land areas globally have warmed by 1.59 °C from 1850–1900 to 2011–2020, substantially higher than the SST warming of 0.88 °C.",
        "At 41°N and 26°N, a decline of –3.1 ± 3.2 Sv per decade and –2.5 ± 2.1 Sv per decade respectively has been reported over 2004–2016 ."

    "Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid.": [
        "However, ‘business as usual’ implies temperature increases over 3°C, implying great future uncertainty, instability and climate damage.",
        "A low-likelihood, high-impact outcome would be several large eruptions that would greatly alter the 21st century climate trajectory compared to SSP-based Earth system model projections.",
        "That judgement refers to impacts that exceed the threshold for severity considered here, suggesting that global warming of 4°C would produce severe risks to peace under present societal conditions ."

    "Most likely the primary control knob [on climate change] is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in.": [

        "But biodiversity changes, warming, acidification and non-climate drivers .",
        "Temperature variations largely control shorter-term predictability of the ocean carbon sink, while longer-term predictability is related to non-thermal drivers such as ocean circulation and biology ."

    "'Global warming' is a myth — so say 80 graphs from 58 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2017.": [
        "The sheer volume of published, peer-reviewed literature on climate change presents a challenge to comprehensive, robust and transparent assessment.",
        "Despite expert scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change, there is polarisation and an ongoing debate over the reality of anthropogenic climate change in the public and policy domains, with attendant risks to society .",
        "The amount of climate change literature available is unevenly distributed across the world, and large bodies of literature (eg, local and regional reports) are often overlooked in the construction of climate information."

    "Neither the rate nor the magnitude of the reported late twentieth century surface warming (1979–2000) lay outside normal natural variability.": [
        "This assessed change in temperature before 1850–1900 is not included in the AR6 assessment of global warming to date, to ensure consistency with previous IPCC assessment reports, and because of the lower confidence in the estimate.",
        "Further, even in the absence of any anthropogenic or natural changes in radiative forcing, Earth’s climate fluctuates on time scales from days to decades or longer.",
        "It is found that at grid-scale, difference in climate response between these two climate states are not detectable by the end of this century."

    "Forward projections of solar cyclicity imply the next few decades may be marked by global cooling rather than warming, despite continuing CO2 emissions.": [
        "In summary, since AR5, multi-decadal decreasing and increasing trends in surface solar radiation of up to several percent per decade have been detected at many more locations, even in remote areas.",
        "In an RCP8.5 scenario, Wild et al conservatively calculate a global reduction of 1% per decade between 2005 and 2049 for future solar power production changes due to changing solar resources as a result of global warming and decreasing all-sky radiation over the coming decades.",
        "The range of insolation averaged over boreal summer at 65°N was about 83 W m−2 during the past million years, and 3.2 W m−2 during the past millennium, but there was no substantial effect upon global average radiative forcing , and shows that solar activity during the second half of the 20th century was in the upper decile of the range."
