This means that the world is now 1C warmer than it was in pre-industrial times,The 60- to 80-year cycle of the atmospheric and oceanic variability over the North Atlantic was also linked to the hiatus by two studies published in 2013 and was used to infer the length of the hiatus.,1
Human CO2 is a tiny fraction of CO2 emissions.,"These models predict an upward trend in the surface temperatures, as well as a more rapid increase in temperature at higher latitudes.",1
"""There are other possible causes for climate change which could be associated with solar activity or related to variations in the temperature of the liquid core of the Earth, which is about 5,400 degrees Celsius.","Henrik Svensmark has suggested that the magnetic activity of the sun deflects cosmic rays, and that this may influence the generation of cloud condensation nuclei, and thereby have an effect on the climate.",0
"The claim that 2.2 conventional jobs are destroyed   for  every new job created in the alternative energy industry is based on a study which relies on incorrect numbers, cherrypicked dates, faulty theory, flawed methodology, and is disproven by real-world examples.","""Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability.",0
IPCC overestimate temperature rise,"Currently, surface temperatures are rising by about 0.2 °C per decade.",0
Climate sensitivity can be calculated empirically by comparing past temperature change to natural forcings at the time.,"In tropical and subtropical areas, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) rose 0.2 °C (0.36 °F) within a 50-year period, and in the North Atlantic and Northwestern Pacific tropical cyclone basins, the potential destructiveness and energy of storms nearly doubled within the same duration, evidencing a clear correlation between global warming and tropical cyclone intensities.",1
97% consensus on human-caused global warming has been disproven.,"Of these, 97% agree, explicitly or implicitly, that global warming is happening and is human-caused.",0
New Study Confirms EVs Considerably Worse For Climate Than Diesel Cars.,"In the scientific literature, there is an overwhelming consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.",1
"‘While volcanic eruptions are natural events, it was the timing of these that had such a noticeable effect on the trend.","The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora created global climate anomalies that became known as the ""Year Without a Summer"" because of the effect on North American and European weather.",0
"As a result, ""The warmest  year on US record is now 1934.","A 2018 systematic review study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatons (Gt) per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002, but has accelerated to an average of 220 Gt per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.",1
"When CO2 levels were higher in the past, solar levels were also lower.","For example, the mole fraction of carbon dioxide has increased from 280 ppm to 415 ppm, or 120 ppm over modern pre-industrial levels.",0
Heat waves have been decreasing since the 1930s in the U.S. and globally.,"Tuvalu was mentioned in the study, and Webb and Kench found that seven islands in one of its nine atolls have spread by more than 3 per cent on average since the 1950s.",1
"In their worst-case scenario, the sea level could rise by six feet by the end of this century, and the pace could pick up drastically in the 22nd century.","Between 1993 and 2017, the global mean sea level rose on average by 3.1 ± 0.3 mm per year, with an acceleration detected as well.",1
"Using satellite data rather than tide-gauge data that is normally used to measure sea levels allows for more precise estimates of global sea level, since it provides measurements of the open ocean.","Tide gauges can only measure relative sea level, whilst satellites can also measure absolute sea level changes.",0
"“The oceans, which absorb more than 90% of the extra CO2 pumped into the atmosphere“","More recently, anthropogenic activities have steadily increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere; about 30–40% of the added CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, forming carbonic acid and lowering the pH (now below 8.1) through a process called ocean acidification.",0
Coral atolls grow as sea levels rise.,[page needed][need quotation to verify] Conditions during the Paleolithic Age went through a set of glacial and interglacial periods in which the climate periodically fluctuated between warm and cool temperatures.,1
IPCC were wrong about Himalayan glaciers,"Two errors include the melting of Himalayan glaciers (see later section), and Dutch land area that is below sea level.",0
"As a result, ""The warmest  year on US record is now 1934.","In 2012, the United States experienced its warmest year on record.",0
"Rising CO2 increases atmospheric water vapor, which makes global warming much worse.",Climate scientists have reached a consensus that the earth is undergoing significant anthropogenic (human-induced) global warming.,1
