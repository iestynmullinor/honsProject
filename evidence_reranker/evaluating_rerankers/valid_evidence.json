emissions and the increase in global mean surface air temperature is due to a better integration of evidence across the science in this assessment.", "Because the largest effects of short-lived GHGs occur shortly after their emission and decline towards the end of the time period, short-lived GHGs have relatively higher integrated metrics than their corresponding endpoint metrics For species perturbations that lead to a strong regional variation in forcing pattern, the regional temperature response can be different to that for CO2.", "Starting with an initial description in AR5 , a body of literature has since expanded the understanding of physical mechanisms from which a simple proportional relationship between cumulative emissions of CO2 and change in global temperature arises – expressed in either global mean surface temperature ; and There is increased confidence in the near-constancy of TCRE because of the variety of methods that have been used to examine this relationship: sensitivity studies with Earth system models of intermediate complexity ; theory-based equations used to examine ESM and EMIC output ; and simple analytical models that capture aspects of the TCRE relationship .", "Cumulative carbon emissions, which have a nearly linear relationship to increases in global surface temperature, are also used."], "Measurements of carbon isotopes and falling oxygen in the atmosphere show that rising carbon dioxide is due to the burning of fossil fuels and cannot be coming from the ocean.": ["It is unequivocal that the increase of CO2 , CH4 , and N2 O in the atmosphere over the industrial era is the result of human activities , 335–383 teragrams of methane per year , and 4.2–11.4 teragrams of nitrogen per year , respectively was distributed between three Earth system components: 46% accumulated in the atmosphere ocean sink , with a faster growth of 9.3 ± 2.4 ppb yr–1 over the last six years .", "Oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks are projected to continue to grow with increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 , but the fraction of emissions taken up by land and ocean is expected to decline as the CO2 concentration increases ."], "At that time, Hansen also produced a model of the future behavior of the globe’s temperature, which he had turned into a video movie that was heavily shopped in Congress.": [], "\"Pollution; none of us are supporting putting substances into the  atmosphere or the waterways that might be pollutants, but carbon dioxide  is not a pollutant.": ["Halting global warming in the long term requires, at a minimum, that no additional CO2 emissions from human activities are added to the atmosphere (ie, CO2 emissions must reach ‘net’ zero)."], "carbon dioxide has had a minuscule effect on global climate.": ["Given that CO2 emissions constitute the dominant human influence on global climate, global net zero CO2 emissions are a prerequisite for stabilising warming at any level.", "Analyses of satellite remote sensing and ground-based observations have indicated that, between 1982 and 2015, the CO2 fertilisation effect has already declined, implying a negative climate system feedback .", "The century-scale climate–carbon cycle response to a CO2 removal from the atmosphere is not always equal and opposite to the response to a CO2 emission (medium confidence).", "All available studies require at least some kind of carbon dioxide removal to reach net zero; that is, there are no studies where absolute zero GHG or even CO2 emissions are reached by deep emissions reductions alone.", "However, CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and reducing emissions of other greenhouse gases (GHGs) alongside CO2 towards net zero emissions of all GHGs would lower the level at which global temperature would peak."], "But by far the largest greenhouse gas is water vapour, which makes 95 per cent of the total.": [], "Global sea level rose about 8 inches in the last century.": ["There was intensified sea level rise during the 1990s and 2000s, with 10-year trends exceeding 20 mm yr–1in the western tropical Pacific Ocean, while sea level trends were negative on the North American west coast.", "The Report concludes with very high confidence that due to the combined increased loss from the ice sheets, global mean sea level is about 2.5 times larger than for 1901–1990.", "From 1982 to 2016, sea levels at central Chile have increased 5 mm yr −1, where El Niño events of 1982–1983 and 1997–1998 caused an extreme increase of 15 to 20 cm in the mean sea level From 1946 to 2017, the number of fires and areas burned have increased significantly in Chile .", "RSL rise is driving a global increase in the frequency of extreme sea levels GMSL rise through the middle of the 21st century exhibits limited dependence on emissions scenario; between 1995–2014 and 2050, GMSL is likely to rise by 0.15–0.23 m under SSP1-1.9 and 0.20–0.30 m under SSP5-8.5 ."], "[CO2] is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature.": ["Atmospheric CO2 from anthropogenic sources has also increased net primary productivity , tree mortality in Europe .", "Additionally, increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 will affect the nutritional quality of C3 plant staples, lowering levels of protein and minerals like zinc and iron .", "Globally, increasing atmospheric CO2 enhances the terrestrial sink but temperature increases constrain it, reflecting the biological process understanding highlighted in previous IPCC
