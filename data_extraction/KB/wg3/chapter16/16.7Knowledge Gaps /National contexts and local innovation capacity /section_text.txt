While a growing body of literature has shown how technology characteristics and complexity, national context and innovation capacity can influence the capacity of a country’s innovation ecosystem as a result of incentive and attraction policies, more research is needed to help prioritise and design policies in different national contexts. Important knowledge gaps need to be filled regarding the impact of ‘green’ public procurement, lending, ‘green’ public banking, and building code policies on innovation outcomes.There is also a superficial understanding of the potential and actual contributions of businesses, educational institutions and socially responsible programmes, particularly in developing countries, as sources of innovation and early adopters of new technologies, and a notable lack of knowledge about indigenous practices.
