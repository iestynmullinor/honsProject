One of knowledge gaps identified when assessing the literature is on the representation of developing countries in studies on innovation and technology development and transfer. This includes the conceptual core disciplines of the economics of innovation, innovation systems and sustainability transitions. This is true for studies on developing countries, and for authors originating from, or active in, developing country contexts. The evidence of the impact of decarbonisation policy instruments applied to developing countries or Small Island Developing States (SIDS) is limited. Expanding the knowledge base with studies that focus on developing countries would not only allow for testing whether the theories (developed by predominantly by developed-country researchers for industrialised countries) hold in developing country contexts, but also yield policy insights that could help both domestic and international policymakers working on climate-related technology cooperation.
