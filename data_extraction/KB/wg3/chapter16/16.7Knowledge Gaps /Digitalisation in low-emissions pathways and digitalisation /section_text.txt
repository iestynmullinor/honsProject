The understanding of the role of digitalisation in decarbonisation pathways is lacking and needs to be studied from several angles. Existing studies do not sufficiently take into account knowledge on the energy impact of digital technologies, in particular the increase in energy demand by digital devices, and the increase in energy efficiency. Studies would benefit from being technology/sector/country-specific.Further exploration is needed into the way digitalisation influences the framework conditions that cause decarbonisation, the socio-economic and behavioural barriers influencing the diffusion of technologies in the long-term scenarios, and the relationship with society and its effects.Given the implications of the digital revolution for sustainability, a better characterisation of governance aspects would increase understanding of the implications for policymakers of digitalisation and the possibilities for it and other general-purpose technologies.Research (theoretical and empirical) on the impacts of imitation, or adaptation of new technological solutions invented in one region and used in other regions, could fill knowledge gaps and accelerate diffusion of climate-related technologies, while taking care not to reduce the incentive for inventors to search for new solutions.
