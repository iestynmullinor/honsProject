Current literature has a strong bias to studies originating from and based on developed countries. Also, innovation and technology literature is skewed to mitigation and, specifically, energy. Literature on technology innovation for adaptation is largely missing.In the area of innovation studies, data are limited on the different indicators used to assess the strength of the innovation system, (even for energy), including global figures on R&D and demonstration spending, also for developing countries, and their effectiveness. There is also a lack of a comprehensive framework and detailed data to assess the strengths of low-emission innovation systems, including interactions among actors, innovation policy implementation, and strength of institutions.
