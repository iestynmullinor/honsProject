As mentioned earlier, RD&D can aid the development of new technologies as well as their adoption for new use contexts. Therefore, it is not surprising that international cooperation on RD&D is identified as a mechanism to promote low-carbon innovation (Suzuki 2015; Mission Innovation 2019; TEC 2021). This has resulted in a variety of international initiatives to cooperate on technology in order to create knowledge spillovers and develop capacity. For example, the UNFCCC Technology Mechanism, among other things, aims to facilitate finance for RD&D of climate technologies by helping with readiness activities for developing country actors. In particular preparing early-stage technologies for a smoother transition to deployment and commercialisation has been emphasised in the context of the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) (TEC 2017). There are numerous multilateral, bilateral and private programmes that have facilitated RD&D, biased mostly towards mitigation (as opposed to adaptation) activities. Many programmes that seemed to be about RD&D were in reality dialogues about research coordination (Ockwell et al. 2015). There are also a variety of possible bilateral and multilateral models and approaches for engaging in joint R&D (Mission Innovation 2019). An update by the TEC (2021) reviewing good practices in international cooperation of technology confirmed the conclusions of Ockwell et al. (2015), and moreover highlighted that most initiatives are led by the public sector, and that the private sector tended to get involved only in incubation, commercialisation and diffusion phases. It also concluded that, although participation of larger, higher-income developing countries seems to have increased, participation of least-developed countries is still very low.
