Besides the UNFCCC mechanisms, there are numerous other initiatives that promote international cooperation on RD&D as well as capacity building. Some of them are based on the notion of ‘mission-oriented innovation policy’ (Mazzucato and Semieniuk 2017; Mazzucato 2018), which shapes markets rather than merely corrects market failures.For instance, Mission Innovation is a global initiative consisting of 23 member countries and the European Commission working together to reinvigorate and accelerate global clean energy innovation with the objective to make clean energy widely affordable with improved reliability and secured supply of energy. The goal is to accelerate clean energy innovation in order to limit the rise in the global temperature to well below 2°C. The members seek to foster international collaboration among its members and increase public investments in clean energy R&D with the engagement of the private sector. A recent assessment shows that, although expenditures are rising, the aims were not met by 2020 (Myslikova and Gallagher 2020). Gross et al. (2018) caution against too much focus on R&D efforts for energy technologies to address climate change, including for Mission Innovation. They argue that, given the timescales of commercialisation, developing new technologies now would mean they would be commercially too late for addressing climate change. Huh and Kim (2018) discuss two ‘knowledge and technology transfer’ projects that were eventually not pursued beyond the feasibility study phase due to cooperation and commitment problems between national and local governments, and they highlight the need for ownership and engagement of local residents and recipient governments.Intellectual property rights (IPR) regimes (Box 16.9) can be an enabler or a barrier to energy transition.
