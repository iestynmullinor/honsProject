Public R&D investments in the energy, renewables, and environment space are generally associated with positive impacts on industrial development or ‘competitiveness outcome’ (robust evidence, medium agreement ). In a number of cases, negligible or negative impacts emerge (Doblinger et al. 2019; Goldstein et al. 2020; Peñasco et al. 2021). The majority of the 15 analyses rely on ex post  quantitative methods, while only four use ex ante modelling approaches. Also, in this case, the vast majority of the evidence is from industrialised countries.There is limited and mixed evidence regarding the (positive or negative) impact of public procurement for low-carbon or climate technologies in developed countries (limited evidence, low agreement ), and none from developing countries. All of the four evaluations identified in the Peñasco et al. (2021) review relied on qualitative methods. One found a positive impact, another a negative impact and two others found no impact. All of the studies covered European country experiences.R&D and procurement policies have a positive impact on distributional outcomes (limited evidence,  high agreement ). Peñasco et al. (2021) identify three evaluations of the impact of RD&D funding on distributional outcomes (two using quantitative methods and one ex ante theoretical methods) and one of procurement on distributional outcomes (relying on qualitative analysis).
