Positive impacts have been identified more frequently in some policies than in others. There is also a lot of variation in the density of the literature. Developing countries are severely underrepresented in the decarbonisation policy instrument evaluation literature aiming to understand the impact on innovation. ( high evidence, high agreement). Figure 16.2 below indicates the extent to which some decarbonisation policy instruments have been more or less investigated in terms of their impact on innovation outcomes (as described in Table 16.9). For example, it indicates the extent to which there has been a greater focus of evaluations of the impact of R&D investments, emissions trading schemes and voluntary approaches on innovation. It also shows a limited amount of evidence on procurement, efficiency obligations with tradeable green certificates (TGCs), building codes and auctions.Figure 16.2 | Number of evaluations available for each policy instrument type covered regarding their impact on innovation and direction of the assessment. The vertical axis displays the number of evaluations claiming to isolate the impact of each policy instrument type on innovation outcomes as listed in Table 16.9. The colour indicates whether each evaluation identified a positive impact on the innovation outcome (blue), the existence of a negative impact (in red), and no impact (in grey). It builds on Grubb et al. (2021), Lilliestam et al. (2021) and Pe√±asco et al. (2021), and additional studies identified as part of these reviews. TGC stands for tradeable green certificates. TWC stands for tradeable white certificates.Open figure
