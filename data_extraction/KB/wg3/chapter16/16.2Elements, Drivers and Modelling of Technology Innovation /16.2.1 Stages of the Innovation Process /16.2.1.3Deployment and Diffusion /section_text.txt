Deployment entails producing a technology at large scale and scaling up its adoption and use across individual firms or households in a given market, and across different markets (Jaffe 2015). In the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation technologies, the purposeful diffusion to developing countries, is referred to as ‘technology transfer’. Most recently, the term ‘innovation cooperation’ has been proposed to indicate that technologies needs to be co-developed and adapted to local contexts (Pandey et al. 2021). Innovation cooperation is an important component of stringent mitigation strategies as well as international agreements (Section 16.5).Diffusion is often sluggish due to lock-in of dominant technologies (Liebowitz and Margolis 1995; Unruh 2000; Ivanova et al. 2018), as well as the time needed to diffuse information about the technologies, heterogeneity among adopters, the incentive to wait until costs fall even further, the presence of behavioural and institutional barriers, and the uncertainty surrounding mitigation policies and long-term commitments to climate targets (Gillingham and Sweeney 2012; Corey 2014; Jaffe 2015; Haelg et al. 2018). In addition, novel technology has been hindered by the actions of powerful incumbents who accrue economic and political advantages over time, as in the case of renewable energy generation (Unruh 2002; Supran and Oreskes 2017; Hoppmann et al. 2019).Technologies have been shown to penetrate the market with a gradual non-linear process in a characteristic logistic (S-shaped) curve (Grübler 1996; Rogers 2003). The time needed to reach widespread adoption varies greatly across technologies relevant for adaptation and mitigation (Gross et al. 2018); in the case of energy technologies, the time needed for technologies to get from a 10–90% market share of saturation ranges between 5 to over 70 years (Wilson 2012). Investment in commercialisation of low-emission technology is largely provided by private financiers; however, governments play a key role in ensuring incentives through supportive policies, including R&D expenditures providing signals to private investors (Haelg et al. 2018), pricing carbon dioxide emissions, public procurement, technology standards, information diffusion and the regulation for end-lifecycle treatment of products ( Cross and Murray 2018) (Section 16.4).
