Energy management systems to reduce energy costs in an integrated and systematic manner were first developed in the 1970s, mainly in low-energy-resource countries, for example, by establishing energy managers and institutionalising management targets (Tanaka 2011). Strategic energy management has since then evolved and been promoted through the establishment of dedicated organisational infrastructures for energy-use optimisation, such as ISO-50001 which specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an energy management system (Biel and Glock 2016; Tunnessen and Macri 2017). Digitalisation, sometimes referred to as Industry 4.0, facilitates further improvements in process control and optimisation through technology development involving sensors, communications, analytics, digital twins, machine learning, virtual reality, and other simulation and computing technologies (Rogers 2018), all of which can improve energy efficiency. One example is combustion control systems, where big data analysis of factors affecting boiler efficiency, operation optimisation and load forecasting have shown that it can lead to energy savings of 9% (Wang et al. 2017).Smart energy systems with real-time monitoring allow for optimisation of innovative technologies, energy demand response, balancing of energy supply and demand including that on real-time pricing, and product quality management, and prediction and reduction of idle time for workers and robots (ERIA 2016; Pusnik et al. 2016; ISO 2018; Legorburu and Smith 2018; Ferrero et al. 2020; Nimbalkar et al. 2020). The IEA estimated that smart manufacturing could deliver 15 EJ in energy savings between 2014 and 2030 (IEA 2019d). Smart manufacturing systems that integrate manufacturing intelligence in real time through the entire production operation have not been yet widely spread in the industry. Examples have been demonstrated and integrated in real operation in the electrical appliance assembly industry (Yoshimoto 2016). Combining process controls and automation allows cost optimisation and improved productivity (Edgar and Pistikopoulos 2018).
