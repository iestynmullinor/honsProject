CCU and CCS have been identified as playing key roles in the transition of industry to net zero. Advancements in the development and deployment of both CCS and CCU foster climate action (SDG 13). Other co-benefits for CCS include control of non-CO2 pollutants (SDG 3), direct foreign investment and know-how (SDG 9), enhanced oil recovery from existing resources, and diversified employment prospects and skills (SDG 8) (Bonner 2017). For CCU, the main co-benefit related contributions are expected within the context of energy transition processes, and in societal advancements that are linked to technological progress (Olfe-Kr√§utlein 2020). Therefore, the expectations are that the deployment of CCU technologies would have least potential for meeting the SDG targets relating to society/people, compared with the anticipated contributions to the pillars of ecology and economy.These mitigation options carry a large number of risks as well. The high cost of the capture and storage process not only limit the technology penetration, but also make energy and products more expensive (risk to SDG 7), potential leaks from undersea or underground CO2 storages carries risks for achieving SDGs 6, 14 and 15. While there are economic costs involved with the deployment of CCS and CCU (Bataille et al. 2018a), there are also significant economic and developmental costs associated with taking no action, because of the potential negative impact of climate change. CCS and CCU have been argued as providing public good (Bergstrom and Ty 2017) and co-benefits to key SDGs (Schipper et al. 2011). On the other hand, Fan et al. (2018) among others have noted the potential lock-in of existing energy structures due to CCS. Refer to Table 17.1 for CCS and CCU co-benefits with respect to other sector chapters.
