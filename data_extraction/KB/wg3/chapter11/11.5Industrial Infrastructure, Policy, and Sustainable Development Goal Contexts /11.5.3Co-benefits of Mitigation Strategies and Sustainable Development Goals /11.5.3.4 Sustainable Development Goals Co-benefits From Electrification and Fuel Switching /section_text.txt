A key, generally underappreciated SDG benefit of electrification is improved urban and indoor air quality (at working places as well) and associated health benefits (SDG 3) from clean electrification (SDG 7) of industrial facilities (IEA 2016). With energy being such an important cross-cutting issue to sustainable development, some SDGs, such as SDGs 1, 3, 4 and 5 (Harmelink et al. 2018) are co-beneficiaries to using electrification and fuel switching as a climate action mitigation option.
