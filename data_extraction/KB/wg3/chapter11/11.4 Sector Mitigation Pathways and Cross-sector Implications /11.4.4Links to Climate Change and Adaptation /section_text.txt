Sectors that are particularly vulnerable to climate change include agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, and their downstream processing industries (Bezner et al. 2021). Many of the energy-intensive industries are located based on access to fresh water (e.g., pulp and paper) or sea transport (e.g., petrochemicals). Risks of major concern for industry include disrupted supply chains and energy supplies due to extreme weather events, as well as risks associated with droughts, floods with dirty water, sea level rise and storm surges (Dodman et al. 2021). Adaptation measures may in turn affect the demand for basic materials (e.g., steel and cement), for example, increased demand to build sea walls and protect infrastructure, but we have not found any estimates of the potential demand. Increased heat stress is unsafe for outdoor labourers and can reduce worker productivity, for example, in outdoor construction, resource extraction and waste handling (Ranasinghe et al. 2021).
