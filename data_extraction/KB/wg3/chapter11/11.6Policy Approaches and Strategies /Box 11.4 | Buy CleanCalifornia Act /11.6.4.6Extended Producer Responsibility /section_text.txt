Extended producer responsibility (EPR) systems are increasingly used by policymakers to require producers to take responsibility for the end life of their outputs and to cover the cost of recycling of materials or otherwise responsibly managing problematic wastes (Kaza et al. 2018). According to the OECD, there are about 400 EPR systems in operation worldwide, three quarters of which have been established over the last two decades. One third of EPR systems cover small consumer electronic equipment, followed by packaging and tyres (each 17%), vehicles, lead-acid batteries and a range of other products (OECD 2016).While the economic value of some discarded materials such as steel, paper and aluminium is generally high enough to justify the cost and efforts of recycling, at current rates of 85%, above 60%, and 43%, respectively (Graedel et al. 2011; Cullen and Allwood 2013), others like plastic or concrete have a much lower re-circularity value (Graedel et al. 2011). Most plastic waste ends up in landfills or dumped in the environment, with 9% recycled and 12% incinerated globally (Geyer et al. 2017; UNEP 2018). Collected waste plastics from OECD countries were largely exported to China until a ban in 2018 required OECD countries to review their practices (Qu et al. 2019). EPR schemes may thus need to be strengthened to actually achieve a reduced use of virgin GHG-intensive materials. The potential for re-circularity of unreacted cement and aggregates in concrete is increasing as new standards and requirement develops. For example, concrete fines are now standardised as a new cement constituent in the European standardisation CEN/TC 51 – ‘cements and construction limes’.
