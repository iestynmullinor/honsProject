A large number of policies and policy instruments can affect GHG emissions and/or sequestration, whether their primary purpose is climate change mitigation or not. Consequently, consistent with the approach in this chapter, this section adopts a broad interpretation to what is considered mitigation policy. Also, the section recognises the multiplicity of policies that overlap and interact.Environmental policy instruments, including for climate change mitigation, have long been grouped into three main categories – (i) economic instruments, (ii) regulatory instruments, and (iii) other instruments – although the specific terms differ across disciplines and additional categories are common (Kneese and Schultze 1975; Jaffe and Stavins 1995; Nordhaus 2013; Wurzel et al. 2013). Examples of common policies in each category are shown in Table 13.1, but this is not a comprehensive list. Principles of and empirical experience with the various instruments are synthesised in Sections 13.6.3 to 13.6.5, international interactions are covered in Section 13.6.6.Table 13.1 | Classification of mitigation policies.
