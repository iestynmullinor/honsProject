An increasing share of global emissions sources is subject to mitigation policies, though coverage is still incomplete (Eskander and Fankhauser 2020; Nascimento et al. 2021).While consistent information on global prevalence of policies is not available, in G20 countries the use of various policy instruments has increased steadily over the past two decades (Nascimento et al. 2021). The share of countries that had mitigation policy instruments in place rose across all sectoral categories, albeit to different extents in different sectors and for different policy instruments (Figure 13.4). Among G20 countries the electricity and heat generation has the greatest number of policies in place, and the agriculture and forestry sector the fewest (Nascimento et al. 2021).Figure 13.4 | Share of countries that adopted different policy instruments in different sectors, 2000â€“2020 (three year moving average).

Open figure The mix of policies has shifted towards more regulatory instruments and carbon pricing relative to information policies and voluntary action (Schmidt and Fleig 2018; Eskander and Fankhauser 2020).The IEA database, which tracks renewable energy and energy efficiency policies at the national and sub-national levels for about 160 countries, indicates an average of about 225 new renewable energy and energy efficiency policies annually from 2010 through 2019 with a peak in the number of new renewable energy policies in 2011 (IEA 2021).While an increasing share of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion is subject to mitigation policies, there remain many countries and sectors where no dedicated mitigation policies apply to fuel combustion. Fossil fuel use is subject to energy taxes in the majority but not all jurisdictions, and in some instances, it is subsidised.The main gaps in current mitigation policy coverage are non-CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions associated with production of industrial materials and chemical feedstocks, which are connected to broader questions of shifting to cleaner production systems (Bataille et al. 2018a; Davis et al. 2018). Sequestration policies focus mainly on forestry and carbon capture and storage (CCS) with limited support for other carbon dioxide removal and use options (Geden et al. 2019; Vonhedemann et al. 2020).
