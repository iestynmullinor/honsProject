Competitiveness: Mitigation policy raises the costs and product prices of regulated sources which causes production to shift to unregulated sources, increasing their emissions.Fossil fuel channel: Regulated sources reduce their fossil fuel use, which lowers fossil fuel prices and increases consumption and associated emissions by unregulated sources.Land-use channel: Mitigation policies that change land use lead to land use and emissions changes in other jurisdictions (Bastos Lima et al. 2019).Terms of trade effect: Price increases for the products of regulated sources shift consumption to other goods, which raises emissions due to the higher output of those goods.Technology channel: Mitigation policy induces low-carbon innovation, which reduces emissions by sources that adopt the innovations that may include unregulated sources (Gerlagh and Kuik 2007).Abatement resource effect: Regulated sources increase use of clean inputs, which reduces inputs available to unregulated sources and so limits their output and emissions (Baylis et al. 2014).Scale channel: Changes to the output of regulated and unregulated sources affect their emissions intensities so emissions changes are not proportional to output changes (Antweiler et al. 2001).Intertemporal channel: Capital stocks of all sources are fixed initially but change over time affecting the costs, prices, output and emissions of regulated and unregulated products.Framing of outcomeEnhancing mitigationAddressing multiple objectives of mitigation and development Approach to policymakingShifting incentives‘Direct mitigation focus’ (Section 13.6; 2.8)  Objective:  reduce GHG emissions nowLiterature:  how to design and implement policy instruments, with attention to distributional and other concernsExamples:  carbon tax, cap and trade, border carbon adjustment, disclosure policies‘Co-benefits’ (Sections 17.3; 5.6.2; 12.4.4)  Objective:  synergies between mitigation and developmentLiterature:  scope for and policies to realise synergies and avoid trade-offs across climate and development objectivesExamples:  appliance standards, fuel taxes, community forest management, sustainable dietary guidelines, green building codes, packages for air pollution, packages for public transportEnabling transition‘Socio-technical transitions’ (Sections 1.7.3; 5.5; 10.8; 6.7; Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16)  Objective:  accelerate low-carbon shifts in socio-technical systemsLiterature:  understand socio-technical transition processes, integrated policies for different stages of a technology ‘S-curve’ and explore structural, social and political elements of transitionsExamples:  packages for renewable energy transition and coal phase-out; diffusion of electric vehicles, process and fuel switching in key industries‘System transitions to shift development pathways’ (Sections 11.6.6; 7.4.5; 13.9; 17.3.3; Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4; Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 13)  Objective:  accelerate system transitions and shift development pathways to expand mitigation options and meet other development goalsLiterature:  examines how structural development patterns and broad cross-sector and economy-wide measures drive ability to mitigate while achieving development goals through integrated policies and aligning enabling conditions Examples:  packages for sustainable urbanisation, land-energy-water nexus approaches, green industrial policy, regional just transition plansFigure 13. 6 | Mapping the landscape of climate policy.
