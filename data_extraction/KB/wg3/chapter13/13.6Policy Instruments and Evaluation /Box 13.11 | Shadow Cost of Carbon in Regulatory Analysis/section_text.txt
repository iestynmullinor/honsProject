In some jurisdictions, public administrations are required to apply a shadow cost of carbon to regulatory analysis.Traditionally, for example in widespread application in the United States, the shadow cost of carbon is calibrated to an estimate of the social cost of carbon as an approximation of expected future cumulative economic damage from a unit of greenhouse gas emissions (Metcalf and Stock 2017). Social cost of carbon is usually estimated using integrated assessment models and is subject to fundamental uncertainties (Pezzey 2019). An alternative approach, used for example in regulatory analysis in the United Kingdom since 2009, is to define a carbon price that is thought to be consistent with a particular targeted emissions outcome. This approach also requires a number of assumptions, including about future marginal costs of mitigation (Aldy et al. 2021).
