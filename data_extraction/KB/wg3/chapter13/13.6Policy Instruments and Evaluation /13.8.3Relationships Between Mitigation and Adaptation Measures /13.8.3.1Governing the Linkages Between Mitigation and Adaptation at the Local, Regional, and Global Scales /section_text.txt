International policy frameworks, such as the 2015 Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Disk Reduction, and the New Urban Agenda for sustainable urban systems, provide an integrated approach for both adaptation and mitigation, while promoting sustainable development and climate resilience across scales (from global, regional, to local government actions (robust evidence,  high agreement ) (Duguma et al. 2014b; Heidrich et al. 2016; Di Gregorio et al. 2017; Locatelli et al. 2017; Nachmany and Setzer 2018; Mills‐Novoa and Liverman 2019). Even so, the specific ways that these linkages are governed vary widely depending on institutional and jurisdictional scale, competing policy priorities, and available capacity (Landauer et al. 2019).Supranational levels of action such as the EU climate change policy have influenced the development and implementation of Climate Change Action Plans (CCAPs) at the sub-national level (Heidrich et al. 2016; Villarroel Walker et al. 2017; Reckien et al. 2018). While adaptation is gaining prominence and is increasingly included in the NDCs of EU nations, the implementation of adaptation and mitigation by EU states are at different stages (Fleig et al. 2017). Fleig et al. (2017) found that all EU states, with the exception of Hungary, have adopted a framework of laws tackling mitigation and adaptation to climate change. However, an assessment of climate legislation in Europe pointed out that there has been little coordination between mitigation and adaptation, and that implementation varies according to different national conditions (Nachmany et al. 2015). More recently, however, integrated adaptation/mitigation plans have been prepared in Europe under the Covenant of Mayors, in which synergies and trade-offs can be better revealed and assessed (Bertoldi et al. 2020).Local governments and cities are increasingly emerging as important climate change actors (Gordon and Acuto 2015) (Section 13.5). While cities and local governments are developing Climate Change Action Plans (CCAPs), plans that explicitly integrate the design and implementation of adaptation and mitigation are a minor percentage, with few cities establishing inter-relationships between them (Nordic Council of Ministers 2017; Grafakos et al. 2018). Compared to national climate governance, local governments are more likely to develop and advance climate policies, generating socio-economic or environmental co-benefits, and improve communities’ quality of life (Gill et al. 2007; Bowen et al. 2014; Duguma et al. 2014b; Mayrhofer and Gupta 2016; Deng et al. 2017; Hennessey et al. 2017). There may be a disconnect, however, between the responsibility that a particular jurisdiction has over mitigation and adaptation (city officials, for instance) and the scale of resources or capacities that they have available to bring to bear on the problem (regional to national provision of energy and transport) (Di Gregorio et al. 2019; Dale et al. 2020).
