Mitigation policies stimulate low-carbon R&D by entities subject to those policies and by other domestic and foreign entities (FSR Climate 2019). Policies to support technology development and diffusion tend to have positive spillover effects between countries (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Section 16.3). Innovation activity in response to a mitigation policy varies by policy type (Jaffe et al. 2002) and stringency (Johnstone et al. 2012). In addition, many governments have policies to stimulate R&D, further increasing low-carbon R&D activity by domestic researchers. Emitters in other countries may adopt some of the new low-carbon technologies thus reducing emissions elsewhere. Technology development and diffusion is reviewed in Chapter 16.
