The performance of sub-national actors’ mitigation policies have been measured using criteria such as existence of mitigation targets, incentives for mitigation, definition of a baseline, and existence of a monitoring, reporting, and verification procedure (Hsu et al. 2019). Existing evaluations range from small-scale studies assessing the mitigation potential of commitments by sub-national regions, cities and companies in the USA or in 10 high-emitting economies (Roelfsema 2017; Hsu et al. 2019), to larger studies finding that over 9149 cities worldwide could mitigate 1400 MtCO2-eq in 2030 (Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy 2018; Hsu et al. 2018, 2019). These sub-national mitigation potential estimates vary since a range of approaches exists for accounting for overlaps between sub-national governments and their nested jurisdictions (e.g., states, provinces, and national governments) (Roelfsema et al. 2018; Hsu et al. 2019). One analysis found that the cities of New York, Berlin, London, Greater Toronto, Boston, and Seattle have achieved on average a 0.27 tCO2-eq per capita per year reduction (Kennedy et al. 2012). Hsu et al. (2020c) found that 60% of more than 1000 European cities, representing 6% of the EU’s total emissions, are on track to achieving their targets, reducing more than 51 MtCO2-eq. While evidence is limited, there are concerns that implementation challenges persist with city level plans, particularly tied to management of initiatives and engagement of the population (Messori et al. 2020).Whether participation in transnational climate initiatives impacts sub-national governments’ achievement on climate mitigation goals is uncertain. Some find that higher ambition in climate mitigation commitments did not translate into greater mitigation (Kona et al. 2016; Hsu et al. 2019). Other studies associate participation in networks with increased solar photovoltaic systems (PV) investment (Khan and Sovacool 2016; Steffen et al. 2019), and with potential to achieve carbon emissions reductions per capita in line with a global 2°C scenario (Kona et al. 2016).Reporting networks may attract high-performing actors, suggesting an artificially high level of cities interested in taking climate action or piloting solutions (self-selection bias) that may not be effective elsewhere (van der Heijden 2018). Many studies present a conservative view of potential mitigation impact because they draw upon publicly reported mitigation actions and exclude sub-national actions that are not reported (Kuramochi et al. 2020).In addition to direct mitigation contributions, climate action partnerships may deliver indirect effects that, while difficult to quantify, ensure long-term change (Chan et al. 2015). Experimentation and policy innovation helps to establish best practices (Hoffmann 2011); set new norms for ambitious climate action that help build coalitions (Chan et al. 2015; Bernstein and Hoffmann 2018); and translate into knowledge sharing or capacity building (Lee and Koski 2012; Hakelberg 2014; Purdon 2015; Acuto and Rayner 2016). Emergent researchexplores whether, in addition to realising outcomes, mitigation initiatives also provide the resources, skills and networks that governments and other stakeholders currently use to target other development goals (Shaw et al. 2014; Wolfram 2016; Wiedenhofer et al. 2018; Amundsen et al. 2018; Heikkinen et al. 2019).
