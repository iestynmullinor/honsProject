Partnerships, such as those among private and public, or transnational and sub-national entities, have been found to enable better mitigation results in areas outside direct government control such as residential energy use, emissions from local businesses, or private vehicles (Fenwick et al. 2012; Castán Broto and Bulkeley 2013; Aylett 2014; Hamilton et al. 2014; Bulkeley et al. 2016; Wakabayashi and Arimura 2016; Grandin et al. 2018). Partnerships take advantage of investments that match available grants or enable a local energy project, or enhance the scope or impact of mitigation (Burch et al. 2013).Sub-national actors have also been associated with experiments and laboratories, which promise to achieve the deep change required to address the climate mitigation gap (Smeds and Acuto 2018; Marvin et al. 2018). Experiments span smart technologies, for example, in Malmö, Sweden (Parks 2019), Eco-Art, Transformation-Labs and other approaches that question the cultural basis of current energy regimes and seek reimagined or reinvented futures (Castán Broto and Bulkeley 2013; Guy et al. 2015; Voytenko et al. 2016; Hodson et al. 2018; Peng and Bai 2018; Smeds and Acuto 2018; Culwick et al. 2019; Pereira et al. 2019; Sengers et al. 2019). They may include governance experiments, from formally defined policy experiments to informal initiatives that mobilise new governance concepts (Kivimaa et al. 2017a; Turnheim et al. 2018), and co-design initiatives and grassroots innovations (Martiskainen 2017; Sheikh and Bhaduri 2021). These initiatives often expand the scope for citizen participation. For example, Urban Living Labs foster innovation, coproducing responses to existing problems of energy use, energy poverty and mobility that integrate scientific and expert knowledge with local knowledge and common values (Voytenko et al. 2016; Marvin et al. 2018). The European Network of Living Labs – with a global outreach – has established a model of open and citizen-centric innovation for policy making. The proliferation of Climate Assemblies at the national and sub-national level further emphasises the increasing role that citizens can play in both innovating and planning for carbon mitigation (Sandover et al. 2021).State and local authorities are often central to initiating and implementing experiments and use an incremental, ‘learning by doing’ governing approach (Bai et al. 2010; Nevens et al. 2013; Castán Broto and Bulkeley 2013; Mcguirk et al. 2015; Nagorny-Koring and Nochta 2018; Hodson et al. 2018; Peng and Bai 2018; Smeds and Acuto 2018; Culwick et al. 2019; Sengers et al. 2019). Experiments relate to technological learning and changes in policies, practices, services, user behaviour, business models, institutions, and governance (Castán Broto and Bulkeley 2013; Wieczorek et al. 2015; Kivimaa et al. 2017a; Laurent and Pontille 2018; Torrens et al. 2019).Experimentation has contributed to learning, changes in outcomes when implemented, and shifts in the political landscape (Turnheim et al. 2018). Experiments, however, are often isolated and do not always result in longer-term, more widespread changes. The transformative potential (understood as changes in the fundamental attributes of natural and human systems, see Annex I: Glossary) of experiments is constrained by uncertainty about locally relevant climate change solutions and effects; a lack of comprehensive, and sectorally inclusive national policy frameworks for decarbonisation; budgetary and staffing limitations; and a lack of institutional and political capacity to deliver integrated and planned approaches (Evans and Karvonen 2014; Mcguirk et al. 2015; Bulkeley et al. 2016; Voytenko et al. 2016; Wittmayer et al. 2016; Webb et al. 2017; Grandin et al. 2018; Hölscher et al. 2018; Nagorny-Koring 2019; Sengers et al. 2019).
