•Greater ex post  empirical studies of mitigation policy outcomes, their design features, the impacts of policy instruments under different conditions of implementation, especially in developing countries. Such research needs to assess the effectiveness, economic and distributional effects, co-benefits and side effects, and transformational potential of mitigation policies.•Understand how packages of policies are designed and implemented, including with attention to local context and trade-offs.•Policy design and institutional needs for the explicit purpose of net zero transitions.•Greater understanding of the differences between, and benefits of, policy packages and economy-wide measures for in-system and cross-system structural change.•Policies and packages for emissions sources that are unregulated or under-regulated, including industrial and non-CO2 emissions.•The existence and extent of carbon leakage across countries, the relative impact of different channels of leakage, and the implications of policy instruments designed to address leakage.
