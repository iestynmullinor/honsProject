Section 13.9 assesses literature related to economy wide and cross â€“ sector systemic change as an approach to accelerate climate mitigation.It focuses specifically on policy and institutions, as two of the six enabling conditions for economy-wide system change and thus provides a third dimension of the role of policy and institutions to climate mitigation. Enabling conditions in general are discussed in Chapter 4 of the SR1.5 (IPCC 2018), as well as Chapter 4 of this report. This section follows on from Section 13.6 (single policy instruments) and 13.7 (policy packages). Section 13.9 literature follows closely on from Section 13.7 literature on policy packages, which discusses change within one system, although there remains an overlap.Section 13.9.2 provides a brief introduction to policy and institutions as two of the six dimensions of enabling conditions, and the importance of enabling conditions to systemic change and climate mitigation. Section 13.9.3 briefly introduces actions for transformative justice, which seek to restructure the underlying system framework that produces mitigation inequalities. Section 13.9.4 provides a brief overview of net zero policies and targets (often no more than aspirational), which imply economy-wide measures and system change. Section 13.9.5 assesses the literature arguing for a system restructuring approach to climate mitigation, based on systemic restructuring. Section 13.9.6 assesses the literature on stimulus packages and green new deals which aim for systemic change, sometimes with value for climate mitigation. And finally, Section 13.9.7 assesses emerging literatures which argues that there are existing challenges to accelerating climate mitigation that may be overcome by systemic change and targeted actions.
