IPCC AR6 WG3, particularly Chapter 4, following on from the IPCC WG3 SR1.5 (IPCC 2018), has highlighted the importance of enabling conditions for delivering successful climate mitigation actions. The AR6 Glossary term for enabling conditions is: ‘enabling conditions include finance, technological innovation, strengthening policy instruments, institutional capacity, multi-level governance, and changes in human behaviour and lifestyles (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (see Glossary). The IPCC SR1.5 report adds to these six dimensions saying enabling conditions also includes ‘inclusive processes, attention to power asymmetries and unequal opportunities for development and reconsideration of values’ (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (IPCC 2018). Not only is the presence of enabling conditions necessary for delivering the successful implementation of single policy instruments and policy packages, but also for delivering systemic change (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (de Coninck et al. 2018; IPCC 2018; Waisman et al. 2019). The feasibility of 1.5°C compatible pathways is contingent upon enabling conditions for systemic change (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (de Coninck et al. 2018; Waisman et al. 2019).At the same time, again following on from SR1.5 report, Section 1.8.1 explains that there are six feasibility dimensions of successful delivery of climate goals. These feasibility dimensions include geophysical; environmental and ecological; technological; economic; behaviour and lifestyles and institutional dimensions. The presence or absence of enabling conditions would affect the feasibility of mitigation as well as adaptation pathways and can reduce trade-offs while amplifying synergies between options (Waisman et al. 2019). Policies and institutions, which are two of the six enabling conditions, are therefore central to accelerated mitigation and systemic change. Identifying, and ensuring, the presence of all the enabling conditions for any given goal, including systemic transformation and acceleration of climate mitigation, is an important first step (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Roberts et al. 2018; Le Treut et al. 2021; Singh and Chudasama 2021).
