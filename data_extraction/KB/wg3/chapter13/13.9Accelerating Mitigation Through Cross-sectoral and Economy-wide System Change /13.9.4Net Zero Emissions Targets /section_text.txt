The last few years have seen a proliferation of net zero emission targets set by national and regional governments, cities as well as companies and institutions (NewClimate Institute and Data Driven EnviroLab 2020; Black et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021) (see also Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3). Meeting these targets implies economy-wide systemic change (medium evidence, high agreement ).The Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) Net Zero Tracker divides countries into those which have net zero emissions achieved, have it in law, have proposed legislation, have it in policy documents or have emission reduction targets under discussion in some form. a recent study estimated that 131 countries have either adopted, announced or are discussing net zero GHG emissions targets, covering 72% of global emissions (Höhne et al. 2021). Out of those, as of 1 October 2021, the ECIU Net Zero Tracker states that Germany, Sweden, the European Union, Japan, United Kingdom, France, Canada, South Korea, Spain, Denmark, New Zealand, Hungary and Luxembourg have net zero targets set in law (ECIU 2021).Some have argued that the expansion of these emission reduction targets marks an important increase in climate mitigation momentum since the Paris Agreement of 2015 and the 2018 IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (Black et al. 2021; Höhne et al. 2021). On the other hand net zero emission targets in their current state vary enormously in scope, quality and transparency – with many countries at the discussion stage – and this makes scrutiny and comparison difficult (NewClimate Institute and Data Driven EnviroLab 2020; Black et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021).In order to realise the mitigation potential of net zero emission targets some areas within the targets might need to be changed. For example, this includes clearer definitions; well defined time frames and scopes; focusing on direct emission reductions within their own territory; minimal reliance on offsets; scrutiny of use and risks of CO2 removal; attention to equity, near-term action coupled with long-term intent setting; and ongoing monitoring and review (medium evidence,  high agreement ) (Levin et al. 2020; NewClimate Institute and Data Driven EnviroLab 2020; Black et al. 2021; Höhne et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021; World Bank 2021b).
