On Friday 20 August 2018, Greta Thunberg participated in the first climate school strike. Since then, Fridays for Future – the name of the group coordinating this tactic of skipping school on Fridays to protest inaction on climate change – has spread around the world.In March 2019, the first global climate strike took place, turning out more than one million people around the world (Carrington 2019). Six months later in September 2019, young people and adults responded to a call to participate in climate strikes as part of the ‘Global Week for Future’ surrounding the UN Climate Action Summit (Thunberg 2019), and the number of participants globally jumped to an estimated six million people (Taylor et al. 2019). Although a handful of studies have reported on who was involved in these strikes, how they were connected, and their messaging (Marris 2019; Wahlström et al. 2019; Evensen 2019; D. Fisher 2019 ; Boulianne et al. 2020; Bevan et al. 2020; Han and Ahn 2020; Holmberg and Alvinius 2020; Jung et al. 2020; Martiskainen et al. 2020; Thackeray et al. 2020; Trihartono et al. 2020; de Moor et al. 2021; Fisher and Nasrin 2021b), its consequences in terms of political outcomes and emissions reductions have yet to be fully understood (Fisher and Nasrin 2021b).Although digital activism makes it easier to connect globally, it is unclear how digital technology will affect the youth climate movement, and its effects on carbon emissions. Research suggests that online activism is likely to involve a more limited range of participants and perspectives (Bennett 2013; Elliott and Earl 2018). Digital tactics could also mean that groups are less embedded in communities and less successful at creating durable social ties, factors that have been found to lead to longer term engagement (Tufekci 2017; Rohlinger and Bunnage 2018; Shirky 2010).
