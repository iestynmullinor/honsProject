Decision-making consistent with energy and climate justice requires attention to procedural justice (McCauley and Heffron 2018), which includes how decisions are made, and who is involved and has influence on decisions (Sovacool and Dworkin 2015). Procedural justice emphasises the importance of equitable access to decision-making processes and non-discriminatory engagement with all stakeholders (Jenkins et al. 2016), attention to the capability, particularly of marginalised groups, to shape decisions (Holland 2017) and recognition of their specific vulnerabilities in collective political processes (Schlosberg 2012). Consensus-building institutions should avoid reducing normative questions to technical ones, recognising that values, interests and behaviours are all shaped by ongoing climate governance (Ryder 2018; Schwanen 2021). Additionally, communities affected by low-carbon transition may face challenges in articulating their understandings and experiences, which needs to be addressed in the design of climate institutions (Ryder 2018; Schwanen 2021).Spatially localised alternative discourses of justice are often more recognised socially than national and universal framings of climate justice (Bailey 2017). Participatory forms of governance such as climate assemblies and citizen juries (Ney and Verweij 2015) can help enhance the legitimacy of institutional decisions, even while empirical assessments suggest that these approaches continue to face practical challenges (Devaney et al. 2020; Sandover et al. 2021; Creasy et al. 2021).
