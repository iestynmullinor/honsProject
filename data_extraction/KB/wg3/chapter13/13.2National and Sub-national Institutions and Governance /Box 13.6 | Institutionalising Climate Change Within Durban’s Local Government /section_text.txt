Durban has effectively linked climate change agendas with ongoing sustainability actions and goals. To do so, adaptation has been broadened to include a just transition to a low-carbon future to address development, energy security and GHG reduction (Roberts et al. 2016).Durban has mainstreamed climate and justice concerns within local government through strong local leadership by key individuals and departments; included climate concerns within various municipal short-term and long-term planning processes; mobilised civil society; enhanced local and international networking; explored funding opportunities; and restructured institutions (Roberts et al. 2016).Durban shows that embedding responses to climate change within local government activities requires that climate change is made relevant locally and framed within a broader environmental justice framework (Roberts 2010). Civil society has been key in balancing the influence of the private sector on Durbanâ€™s dynamic political process (Aylett 2013).
