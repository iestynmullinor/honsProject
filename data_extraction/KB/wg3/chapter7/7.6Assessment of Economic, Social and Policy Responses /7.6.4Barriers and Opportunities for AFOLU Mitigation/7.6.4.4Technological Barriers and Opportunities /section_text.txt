Monitoring, reporting, and verification. Development of satellite technologies to assess potential deforestation has grown in recent years with the release of 30 m data by Hansen et al. (2013), however, this data only captures tree cover loss, and increasing accuracy over time may limit its use for trend analysis (Ceccherini et al. 2020; Palah√≠ et al. 2021). Datasets on forest losses are less well developed for reforestation and afforestation. As Mitchell et al. (2017) point out, there has been significant improvement in the ability to measure changes in tree and carbon density on sites using satellite data, but these techniques are still evolving and improving and they are not yet available for widespread use.Ground-based forest inventory measurements have been developed in many countries, most prominently in the Northern Hemisphere, but more and more countries are starting to develop and collect national forest inventories. Training and capacity building is going on in many developing countries under UNREDD and FAO programmes. Additional efforts to harmonise data collection methods and to make forest inventory data available to the scientific community would improve confidence in forest statistics, and changes in forest statistics over time. To some extent the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative fills in this data gap (https://gfbi.udl.cat/).
