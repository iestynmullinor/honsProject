Combined mitigation and adaptation approaches have been highlighted throughout Section 7.4 regarding specific measures. Land-based mitigation and adaptation to the risks posed by climate change and extreme weather events can have several co-benefits as well as help promote development and conservation goals. Land-based mitigation and adaptation will not only help reduce GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector, but measures are required to closely link up with adaptation. In the central 2°C scenario, improved management of land and more efficient forest practices, a reduction in deforestation and an increase in afforestation, would account for 10% of the total mitigation effort over 2015–2050 (Keramidas et al. 2018). If managed and regulated appropriately, the Land sector could become carbon-neutral as early as 2030–2035, being a key sector for emissions reductions beyond 2025 (Keramidas et al. 2018). Nature-based solutions (NBS) with safeguards has immense potential for cost-effective adaptation to climate change; but their impacts will vary by scale and contexts ( high confidence). Griscom et al. 2017 estimate this potential to provide 37% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation until 2030 needed to meet 2°C goals with likely co-benefits for biodiversity. However, due to the time lag for technology deployment and natural carbon gain this mitigation potential of NBS by 2030 or 2050 can be delayed or much lower than the estimated potential (Qin et al. 2021).
