In addition to livestock, both AR5 and the SRCCL identified paddy rice cultivation as an important emissions source (Smith et al. 2014), with medium evidence and  high agreement  that its expansion is a key driver of growing trends in atmospheric CH4 concentration (Jia et al. 2019). The latest data indicate the global harvested area of rice to have grown by 11% between 1990 and 2019, with total paddy production increasing by 46%, from 519 Mt to 755 Mt (FAO 2021c). Global rice production is projected to increase by 13% by 2028 compared to 2019 levels (OECD/FAO 2019). However, yield increases are expected to limit cultivated area expansion, while dietary shifts from rice to protein as a result of increasing per capita income, is expected to reduce demand in certain regions, with a slight decline in related emissions projected to 2030 (USEPA 2019).Between 1990 and 2019, Africa recorded the greatest increase (+160%) in area under rice cultivation, followed by Asia and the Pacific (+6%), with area reductions evident in all other regions (FAO 2021c) broadly corresponding with related regional CH4 emission (Figures 7.3 and 7.8). Data indicate the greatest growth in consumption (average annual supply per capita) between 1990 and 2013 to have occurred in Eastern Europe and West Central Asia (+42%) followed by Africa (+25%), with little change (+1%) observed in Asia and the Pacific (FAO 2017a). Most of the projected increase in global rice consumption is in Africa and Asia (OECD/FAO 2019).
