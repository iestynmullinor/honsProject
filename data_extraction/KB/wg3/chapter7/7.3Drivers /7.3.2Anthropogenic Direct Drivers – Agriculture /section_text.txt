Both AR5 and the SRCCL described considerable increases in global use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers since the 1970s, which was identified to be a major driver of increasing N2O emissions (Jia et al. 2019). The latest data document a 41% increase in global nitrogen fertiliser use between 1990 and 2019 (FAO 2021e) corresponding with associated increased N2O emissions (Figure 7.3). Increased fertiliser use has been driven by pursuit of increased crop yields, with for example, a 61% increase in average global cereal yield per hectare observed during the same period (FAO 2021c), achieved through both increased fertiliser use and varietal improvements. Increased yields are in response to increased demand for food, feed, fuel and fibre crops which in turn has been driven by a growing human population (FAO, 2019), increased demand for animal-sourced food and bioenergy policy (OECD/FAO 2019). Global crop production is projected to increase by almost 15% over the next decade, with low income and emerging regions with greater availability of land and labour resources expected to experience the strongest growth, and account for about 50% of global output growth (OECD/FAO 2019). Increases in global nitrogen fertiliser use are also projected, notably in low income and emerging regions (USEPA 2019).
