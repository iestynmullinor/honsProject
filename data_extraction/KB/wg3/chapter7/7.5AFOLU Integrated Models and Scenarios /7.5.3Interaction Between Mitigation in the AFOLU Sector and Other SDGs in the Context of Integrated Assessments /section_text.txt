Besides the level of biomass supply for bioenergy, the adoption of SDGs may also significantly impact AFOLU emissions and the land-use sectorâ€™s ability for GHG abatement (Frank et al. 2021). Selected SDGs are found to have positive synergies for AFOLU GHG abatement and to consistently decrease GHG emissions for both agriculture and forestry, thereby allowing for even more rapid and deeper emissions cuts. In particular, the decreased consumption of animal products and less food waste (SDG 12), and the protection of high biodiversity ecosystems such as primary forests (SDG 15) deliver high synergies with GHG abatement. On the other hand, protection of highly biodiverse ecosystems from conversion (SDG 15) limits the global biomass potentials for bioenergy (Frank et al. 2021), and while several forestry measures enhancing woody biomass supply for bioenergy may have synergies with improving ecosystems conditions, many represent a threat to biodiversity (Camia et al. 2020) (Sections 7.6.5 and 17.3.3.7, Figure 17.1 and Supplementary Material Table 17.SM.1).
