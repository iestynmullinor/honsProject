At the regional level (Figure 7.16), the highest potential from non-CO2 emissions abatement, and mostly from CH4, is reported for ASIA with the median of mitigation potential observations from CH4 increasing up to a price of USD200 in the year 2050, reaching a median of 1.2 GtCO2-eq yr –1. In terms of economic potential, ASIA is followed by LAM, AFRICA, and OECD+EU, where emission reduction mainly is achieved in the livestock sector.The highest potentials from land-related CO2 emissions, including avoided deforestation as well as afforestation, can be observed in LAM and AFRICA with strong responses of mitigation (indicated by the median value) to carbon prices mainly in the lower range of displayed carbon prices. In general, CO2 mitigation potentials show a wide range of results in comparison to non-CO2 mitigation potentials, but mostly also a higher median value. The most extreme ranges are reported for the regions LAM and AFRICA. A medium potential is reported for ASIA and OECD+EU, while REF has the smallest potential according to model submissions. These estimates reflect techno-economic potentials and do not necessarily include feasibility constraints which are discussed in Chapter 7.6.Figure 7.16 | Regional mitigation efforts for CO2, CH4and N2O emissions (in CO2-eq yr–1using IPCC AR6 GWP100 values) from the AFOLU sector for increasing carbon price levels for 2030 and 2050. Underlying datapoints are generated by comparing emissions between a policy scenario and a related benchmark scenario, mapping these differences with the respective carbon price differences. Boxplots show Medians (vertical line within the boxes), Means (dots), 33%–66% intervals (box) and 10%–90% intervals (horizontal lines) for respective scenarios of carbon prices implemented in intervals of USD50 from a price of USD0 to USD250. Regions: Asia (ASIA), Latin America and Caribbean (LAM), Middle East (MIDDLE_EAST), Africa (AFRICA), Developed Countries (OECD 90 and EU) (OECD+EU) and Reforming Economies of Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union (REF).Open figure
