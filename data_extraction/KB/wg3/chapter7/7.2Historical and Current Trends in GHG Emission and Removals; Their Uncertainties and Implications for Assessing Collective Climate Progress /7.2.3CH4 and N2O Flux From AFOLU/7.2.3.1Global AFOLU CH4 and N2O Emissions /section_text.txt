Using FAOSTAT data, the SRCCL estimated average CH4 emissions from AFOLU to be 161.2 ± 43 MtCH4 yr –1 for the period 2007–2016, representing 44% of total anthropogenic CH4 emissions, with agriculture accounting for 88% of the AFOLU component (Jia et al. 2019). The latest data (FAO 2021a, 2020b) highlight a trend of growing AFOLU CH4 emissions, with a 10% increase evident between 1990 and 2019, despite year-to-year variation. Forestry and other land use (FOLU) CH4 emission sources include biomass burning on forest land and combustion of organic soils (peatland fires) (FAO 2020c). The agricultural share of AFOLU CH4 emissions remains relatively unchanged, with the latest data indicating agriculture to have accounted for 89% of emissions on average between 1990 and 2019. The SRCCL reported with medium evidence and  high agreement  that ruminants and rice production were the most important contributors to overall growth trends in atmospheric CH4 (Jia et al. 2019). The latest data confirm this in terms of agricultural emissions, with  agreement between databases that agricultural CH4 emissions continue to increase and that enteric fermentation and rice cultivation remain the main sources (Figure 7.7). The proportionally higher emissions from rice cultivation indicated by EDGAR data compared to the other databases, may result from the use of a Tier 2 methodology for this source within EDGAR (Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2019).Figure 7.7 | Estimated global mean agricultural CH4 (top), N2O (middle) and aggregated CH4and N2O (using CO2-eq according to GWP100 AR6 values).  (Bottom) emissions for three decades according to EDGAR v6.0 (Crippaet al. 2021), FAOSTAT (FAO 2021a) and USEPA (USEPA 2019) databases. Latest versions of databases indicate historic emissions to 2019, 2019 and 2015 respectively, with average values for the post–2010 period calculated accordingly. For CH4, emissions classified as ‘Other Ag.’ within USEPA data, are re-classified as ‘Agricultural Biomass Burning’. Despite CH4 emissions from agricultural soils also being included, this category was deemed to principally concern biomass burning on agricultural land and classified accordingly. For N2O, emissions classified within EDGAR as direct and indirect emissions from managed soils, and indirect emissions from manure management are combined under ‘Agricultural Soils’. Emissions classified by FOASTAT as from manure deposition and application to soils, crop residues, drainage of organic soils and synthetic fertilisers are combined under ‘Agricultural Soils’, while emissions reported as ‘Other Ag.’ under USEPA data are re-classified as ‘Agricultural Biomass Burning’.Open figure The SRCCL also noted a trend of increasing atmospheric N2O concentration, with robust evidence and  high agreement  that agriculture accounted for approximately two-thirds of overall global anthropogenic N2O emissions. Average AFOLU N2O emissions were reported to be 8.7 ± 2.5 MtN2O yr –1 for the period 2007–2016, accounting for 81% of total anthropogenic N2O emissions, with agriculture accounting for 95% of AFOLU N2O emissions (Jia et al. 2019). A recent comprehensive review confirms agriculture as the principal driver of the growing atmospheric N2O concentration (Tian et al. 2020). The latest FAOSTAT data (FAO 2020b, 2021a) document a 25% increase in AFOLU N2O emissions between 1990 and 2019, with the average share from agriculture remaining approximately the same (96%). Agricultural soils were identified in the SRCCL and in recent literature as a dominant emission source, notably due to nitrogen fertiliser and manure applications to croplands, and manure production and deposition on pastures (Jia et al. 2019; Tian et al. 2020). There is agreement within latest data that agricultural soils remain the dominant source (Figure 7.7).Aggregation of CH4 and N2O to CO2 equivalence (using GWP100 IPCC AR6 values), suggests that AFOLU emissions increased by 15% between 1990 and 2019, though emissions showed trend variability year to year. Agriculture accounted for 91% of AFOLU emissions on average over the period (FAO 2020b, 2021a). EDGAR (Crippa et al. 2021), FAOSTAT (FAO 2021a) and USEPA (USEPA 2019) data suggest aggregated agricultural emissions (CO2-eq) to have increased since 1990, by 19% (1990–2019), 15% (1990–2019) and 21% (1990–2015) respectively, with all databases identifying enteric fermentation and agricultural soils as the dominant agricultural emissions sources.
