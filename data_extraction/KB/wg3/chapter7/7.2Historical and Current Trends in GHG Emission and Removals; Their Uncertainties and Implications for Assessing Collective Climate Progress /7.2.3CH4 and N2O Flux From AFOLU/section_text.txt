FAOSTAT data (FAO 2020b, 2021a) indicate Africa (+44%), followed by Southern Asia (+29%) to have the largest growth in AFOLU CH4 emissions between 1990 and 2019 (Figure 7.8). Eurasia was characterised by notable emission reductions (–58%), principally as a result of a sharp decline (–63%) between 1990 and 1999. The average agricultural share of AFOLU emissions between 1990 and 2019 ranged from 66% in Africa to almost 100% in the Middle East.In agreement with AR5 (Smith et al. 2014), the SRCCL identified Asia as having the largest share (37%) of emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management since 2000, but Africa to have the fastest growth rate. Asia was identified as responsible for 89% of rice cultivation emissions, which were reported as increasing (Jia et al. 2019). Considering classification by ten IPCC regions, data suggest enteric fermentation to have dominated emissions in all regions since 1990, except in South-East Asia and Pacific, where rice cultivation forms the principal source (FAO 2021; USEPA 2019). The different databases broadly indicate the same regional CH4 emission trends, though the indicated absolute change differs due to methodological differences (Section 7.2.3.1). All databases indicate considerable emissions growth in Africa since 1990 and that this region recorded the greatest regional increases in emissions from both enteric fermentation and rice cultivation since 2010. Additionally, FAOSTAT data suggest that emissions from agricultural biomass burning account for a notably high proportion of agricultural CH4 emissions in Africa (Figure 7.8).The latest data suggest growth in AFOLU N2O emissions in most regions between 1990 and 2019, with Southern Asia demonstrating highest growth (+74%) and Eurasia, greatest reductions (–51%), the latter mainly a result of a 61% reduction between 1990 and 2000 (FAO 2020b, 2021a). Agriculture was the dominant emission source in all regions, its proportional average share between 1990 and 2019 ranging from 87% in Africa, to almost 100% in the Middle East (Figure 7.8).The SRCCL provided limited discussion on regional variation in agricultural N2O emissions but reported with medium confidence that certain regions (North America, Europe, East and South Asia) were notable sources of grazing land N2O emissions (Jia et al. 2019). The AR5 identified Asia as the largest source and as having the highest growth rate of N2O emissions from synthetic fertilisers between 2000 and 2010 (Smith et al. 2014). Latest data indicate agricultural N2O emission increases in most regions, though variation between databases prevents definitive conclusions on trends, with Africa, Southern Asia, and Eastern Asia suggested to have had greatest growth since 1990 according to EDGAR (Crippa et al. 2021), FAOSTAT (FAO 2021a) and USEPA (USEPA 2019) data respectively. However, all databases indicate that emissions declined in Eurasia and Europe from 1990 levels, in accordance with specific environmental regulations put in place since the late 1980s (Tubiello 2019; European Environment Agency 2020; Tian et al. 2020), but generally suggest increases in both regions since 2010.Figure 7.8 | Estimated average AFOLU CH4 (top) and N2O (bottom) emissions for three decades according to FAOSTAT data by ten global regions, with disaggregation of agricultural emissions (FAO 2020b; 2021a).
