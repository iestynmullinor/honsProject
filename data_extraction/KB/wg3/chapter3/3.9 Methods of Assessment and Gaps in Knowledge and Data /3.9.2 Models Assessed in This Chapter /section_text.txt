The models assessed in this chapter differ in their sectoral coverage and the level of complexity in each sector. Models tend to have more detail in their representation of energy supply and transportation, than they do for industry (Section 3.4 and Annex III.I). Some models include detailed land-use models, while others exclude land models entirely and use supply curves to represent bioenergy potential (Bauer et al. 2018a). IAMs do not include all mitigation options available in the literature (Rogelj et al. 2018 b; Smith et al. 2019). For example, most IAM pathways exclude many granular demand-side mitigation options and land-based mitigation options found in more detailed sectoral models; additionally, only a few pathways include CDR options beyond afforestation/reforestation and BECCS. Section 3.4 and Chapter 12 include some results and comparisons to non-IAM models (e.g., bottom-up studies and detailed sectoral models). These sectoral studies often include a more complete set of mitigation options but exclude feedbacks and linkages across sectors which may alter the mitigation potential of a given sector. There is an increasing focus in IAM studies on SDGs (Section 3.7), with some studies reporting the implications of mitigation pathways on SDGs (e.g., Bennich et al. 2020) and others using achieving SDGs as a constraint on the scenario itself (van Vuuren et al. 2015; Soergel et al. 2021a). However, IAMs are still limited in the SDGs they represent, often focusing on energy, water, air pollution and land. On the economic side, the majority of the models report information on marginal costs (i.e., carbon price). Only a subset provides full economic implications measured by either economic activity or welfare. Also often missing, is detail about economic inequality within countries or large aggregate regions.For further details about the models and scenarios, see Annex III.
