Mitigation pathways show differences in the timing of decarbonisation (Figure 3.20) and the timing of net zero (Figure 3.19) across sectors and regions ( high confidence); the timing in a given sector depends on the cost of abatement in it, the availability of CDR options, the scenario design, near-term emissions levels, and the amount of non-CO2 abatement (Yeh et al. 2017; Emmerling et al. 2019; Rogelj et al. 2019a,b; Johansson et al. 2020; Azevedo et al. 2021; Ou et al. 2021; van Soest et al. 2021b) (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter). However, delaying emissions reductions, or more limited emissions reductions in one sector or region, involves compensating reductions in other sectors or regions if warming is to be limited ( high confidence) (Price and Keppo 2017; Grubler et al. 2018; Rochedo et al. 2018; van Soest et al. 2021b).At the time of net zero global CO2 emissions, emissions in some sectors are positive and some negative. In cost-effective mitigation pathways, the energy supply sector typically reaches net zero CO2 before the economy as a whole, while the demand sectors reach net zero CO2 later, if at all (Pietzcker et al. 2014; Price and Keppo 2017; Luderer et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018 a,b; Méjean et al. 2019; Azevedo et al. 2021) (Section 6.7). CO2 emissions from transport, industry, and buildings are positive, and non-CO2GHG emissions are also positive at the time of global net zero CO2 emissions (Figure 3.20).Figure 3.19| Decade in which sectoral CO2 emissions first reach net negative values. Each panel is a different temperature level. The colours indicate the decade in which CO2 emissions go negative; the y-axis indicates the share of scenarios achieving net zero in that decade. Only scenarios that pass the vetting criteria are included (Section 3.2). Scenarios achieving net zero prior to 2020 are excluded.Open figure Figure 3.20 | Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including CO2 emissions by sector and total non-CO2 GHGs in 2050 (top left), 2100 (top middle), year of global net zero CO2 (top right), cumulative CO2 emissions from 2020–2100 (bottom left), and cumulative CO2 emissions from 2020 until the year of net zero CO2 for scenarios that limit warming to below 2°C.  Scenarios are grouped by their temperature category. ‘Industry’ includes CO2 emissions associated with industrial energy use only; sectors shown in this figure do not necessarily sum to total CO2. In this, and other figures in Section 3.4, unless stated otherwise, only scenarios that pass the vetting criteria are included (Section 3.2). Boxes indicate the interquartile range, the median is shown with a horizontal black line, while vertical lines show the 5–95% interval.Open figure So, while pathways indicate some flexibility in emissions reductions across sectors, all pathways involve substantial CO2 emissions reductions in all sectors and regions ( high confidence) (Luderer et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018 a,b; Méjean et al. 2019; Azevedo et al. 2021). Projected CO2 emissions reductions between 2019 and 2050 in 1.5°C (>50%) pathways with no or limited overshoot are around 77% for energy demand, with a 5–95% range of 31–96%, 12 115% for energy supply (90–167%), and 148% for AFOLU (94–387%). In pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%), projected CO2 emissions are reduced between 2019 and 2050 by around 49% for energy demand, 97% for energy supply, and 136% for AFOLU (Sections 3.4.2–3.4.6). Almost 75% of GHG reductions at the time of net zero GHG are from the energy system, 13% are from AFOLU CO2, and 13% from non-CO2 (Figure 3.21). These reductions are achieved through a variety of sectoral strategies, illustrated in Figure 3.21 (Figure 3.21b), and described in Sections 3.4.2 to 3.4.7; the primary strategies include declines in fossil energy, increases in low-carbon energy use, and CDR to address residual emissions.Table 3.4 | Energy and emissions characteristics of the pathways by climate category for 2030, 2050, 2100.

Source: AR6 Scenarios Database.Open figure In the context of mitigation pathways, only a few studies have examined solar radiation modification (SRM), typically focusing on Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (Arinoa et al. 2016; Emmerling and Tavoni 2018a,b; Heutel et al. 2018; Helwegen et al. 2019; Rickels et al. 2020; Belaia et al. 2021). These studies find that substantial mitigation is required to limit warming to a given level, even if SRM is available (Moreno-Cruz and Smulders 2017; Emmerling and Tavoni 2018b; Belaia et al. 2021). SRM may reduce some climate impacts, reduce peak temperatures, lower mitigation costs, and extend the time available to achieve mitigation; however, SRM does not address ocean acidification and may involve risks to crop yields, economies, human health, or ecosystems (AR6 WGII Chapter 16; AR6 WGI TS and Chapter 5; SR1.5 SPM; and Cross-Working Group Box 4 in Chapter 14 of this report). There are also significant uncertainties surrounding SRM, including uncertainties on the costs and risks, which can substantially alter the amount of SRM used in modelled pathways (Tavoni et al. 2017; Heutel et al. 2018; IPCC 2018; Helwegen et al. 2019; NASEM 2021). Furthermore, the degree of international cooperation can influence the amount of SRM deployed in scenarios, with uncoordinated action resulting in larger SRM deployment and consequently larger risks/impacts from SRM (Emmerling and Tavoni 2018a). Bridging research and governance involves consideration of the full range of societal choices and ramifications (Sugiyama et al. 2018). More information on SRM, including the caveats, risks, uncertainties, and governance issues is found in AR6 WGI Chapter 4; AR6 WGIII Chapter 14; and Cross-Working Group Box 4 in Chapter 14 of this report.
