Most IAM pathways rely heavily on supply-side mitigation strategies, including fuel switching, decarbonisation of fuels, and CDR (Creutzig et al. 2016; Bertram et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018 b; Mundaca et al. 2019). For demand-side mitigation, IAMs incorporate changes in energy efficiency, but many other demand-side options (e.g., behaviour and lifestyle changes) are often excluded from models (van Sluisveld et al. 2015; Creutzig et al. 2016; van den Berg et al. 2019; Wilson et al. 2019). In addition, this mitigation is typically price-driven and limited in magnitude (Yeh et al. 2017; Luderer et al. 2018; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019; Sharmina et al. 2020). In contrast, bottom-up modelling studies show considerable potential for demand-side mitigation (Creutzig et al. 2016; Yeh et al. 2017; Mundaca et al. 2019; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019) (Chapter 5), which can slow emissions growth and/or reduce emissions (Creutzig et al. 2016; Samadi et al. 2017).A small number of mitigation pathways include stringent demand-side mitigation, including changes in thermostat set points (van Sluisveld et al. 2016; van Vuuren et al. 2018), more efficient or smarter appliances (van Sluisveld et al. 2016; Grubler et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019), increased recycling or reduced industrial goods (Liu et al. 2018; van Sluisveld et al. 2016; Grubler et al. 2018; van de Ven et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019), telework and travel avoidance (Grubler et al. 2018; van de Ven et al. 2018), shifts to public transit (van Sluisveld et al. 2016; Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018), reductions in food waste (van de Ven et al. 2018) and less meat-intensive diets (Liu et al. 2018; van de Ven et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018). These pathways show reduced dependence on CDR and reduced pressure on land (Grubler et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018 a; van de Ven et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018) (Section 5.3.3). However, the representation of these demand-side mitigation options in IAMs is limited, with most models excluding the costs of such changes (van Sluisveld et al. 2016), using stylised assumptions to represent them (van den Berg et al. 2019), and excluding rebound effects (Krey et al. 2019; Brockway et al. 2021). Furthermore, there are questions about the achievability of such pathways, including whether the behavioural changes included are feasible (Azevedo et al. 2021) and the extent to which development and demand can be decoupled (Steckel et al. 2013; Brockway et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021; Semieniuk et al. 2021).Figure 3.18 shows indicators of supply- and demand-side mitigation in the IMPs, as well as the range across the database. Two of these IMPs (IMP-SP, IMP-LD) show strong reductions in energy demand, resulting in less reliance on bioenergy and limited CDR from energy supply. In contrast, IMP-Neg has higher energy demand, depending more on bioenergy and net negative CO2 emissions from energy supply.Figure 3.18 | Indicators of demand and supply-side mitigation in the Illustrative Pathways (lines) and the 5–95% range of Reference, 1. 5°C and 2°C scenarios (shaded areas).
