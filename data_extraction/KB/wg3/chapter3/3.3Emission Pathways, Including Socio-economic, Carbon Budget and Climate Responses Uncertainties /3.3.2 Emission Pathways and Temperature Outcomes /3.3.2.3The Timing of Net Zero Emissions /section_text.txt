In addition to the constraints on change in global mean temperature, the Paris Agreement also calls for reaching a balance of sources and sinks of GHG emissions (Art. 4). Different interpretations of the concept related to balance have been published (Rogelj et al. 2015c; Fuglestvedt et al. 2018). Key concepts include that of net zero CO2 emissions (anthropogenic CO2 sources and sinks equal zero) and net zero greenhouse gas emissions (see Annex I: Glossary, and Box 3.3). The same notion can be used for all GHG emissions, but here ranges also depend on the use of equivalence metrics (Box 2.1). Moreover, it should be noted that while reaching net zero CO2 emissions typically coincides with the peak in temperature increase; net zero GHG emissions (based on GWP-100) imply a decrease in global temperature (Riahi et al. 2021) and net zero GHG emissions typically require negative CO2 emissions to compensate for the remaining emissions from other GHGs. Many countries have started to formulate climate policy in the year that net zero emissions (either CO2 or all greenhouse gases) are reached – although, at the moment, formulations are often still vague (Rogelj et al. 2021). There has been increased attention on the timing of net zero emissions in the scientific literature and ways to achieve it.Figure 3.14 shows that there is a relationship between the temperature target, the cumulative CO2 emissions budget, and the net zero year for CO2 emissions (panel a) and the sum of greenhouse gases (panel b) for the scenarios published in the literature. In other words, the temperature targets from the Paris Agreement can, to some degree, be translated into a net-zero emission year (Tanaka and O’Neill 2018). There is, however, a considerable spread. In addition to the factors influencing the emission budget (AR6 WGI and Section 3.3.2.2), this is influenced by the emission trajectory until net zero is reached, decisions related to temperature overshoot and non-CO2 emissions (especially for the moment CO2 reaches net zero emissions). Scenarios with limited or no net negative emissions and rapid near-term emission reductions can allow small positive emissions (e.g., in hard-to-abate-sectors). They may therefore have a later year that net zero CO2 emissions are achieved. High emissions in the short term, in contrast, require an early net zero year.Figure 3.14 | Net zero year for CO2 and all GHGs (based on AR6GWP100) as a function of remaining carbon budget and temperature outcomes (note that scenarios that stabilise (near) zero are also included in determining the net zero year). Open figure For the scenarios in the C1 category (limit warming to 1.5°C (>50% with no or limited overshoot, the net zero year for CO2 emissions is typically around 2035–2070. For scenarios in C3 (limiting warming to 2°C (>67%)), CO2 emissions reach net zero around after 2050. Similarly, also the years for net zero GHG emissions can be calculated (see Fig 3.14b. The GHG net zero emissions year is typically around 10–40 years later than the carbon neutrality. Residual non-CO2 emissions at the time of reaching net zero CO2 range between 5–11 GtCO2-eq in pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower. In pathways limiting warming to 2°C (>67%), methane is reduced by around 19% (3–46%) in 2030 and 46% (29–64%) in 2050, and in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot by around 34% (21–57%) in 2030 and a similar 51% (35–70%) in 2050. Emissions-reduction potentials assumed in the pathways become largely exhausted when limiting warming to 2°C (>50%). N2O emissions are reduced too, but similar to CH4, emission reductions saturate for stringent climate goals. In the mitigation pathways, the emissions of cooling aerosols are reduced due to reduced use of fossil fuels. The overall impact on non-CO2-related warming combines these factors.In cost-optimal scenarios, regions will mostly achieve net zero emissions as a function of options for emission reduction, CDR, and expected baseline emission growth (van Soest et al. 2021b). This typically implies relatively early net zero emission years in scenarios for the Latin America region and relatively late net zero years for Asia and Africa (and average values for OECD countries). However, an allocation based on equity principles (such as responsibility, capability and equality) might result in different net zero years, based on the principles applied – with often earlier net zero years for the OECD (Fyson et al. 2020; van Soest et al. 2021b). Therefore, the emission trajectory until net zero emissions is a critical determinant of future warming (Section 3.5). The more CO2 is emitted until 2030, the less CO2 can be emitted after that to stay below a warming limit (Riahi et al. 2015). As discussed before, also non-CO2 forcing plays a key role in the short term.
