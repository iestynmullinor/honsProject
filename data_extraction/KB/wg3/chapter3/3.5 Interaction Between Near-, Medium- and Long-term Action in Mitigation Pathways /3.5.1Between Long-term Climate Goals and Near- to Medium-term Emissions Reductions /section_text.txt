The close link between cumulative CO2 emissions and warming has strong implications for the relationship between near-, medium-, and long-term climate action to limit global warming. The AR6 WGI Assessment has estimated a remaining carbon budget of 500 (400) GtCO2 from the beginning of 2020 onwards for staying below 1.5°C with 50% (67%) likelihood, subject to additional uncertainties about historic warming and the climate response, and variations in warming from non-CO2 climate forcers (Canadell and Monteiro 2019) (AR6 WGI Chapter 5, Section 5.5). For comparison, if current CO2 emissions of more than 40 GtCO2 are keeping up until 2030, more than 400 GtCO2 will be emitted during 2021–2030, already exhausting the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C by 2030.The relationship between warming limits and near-term action is illustrated in Figure 3.29, using a set of 1.5°C–2°C scenarios with different levels of near-term action, overshoot and non-CO2 warming contribution from a recent study (Riahi et al. 2021). In general, the more CO2 is emitted until 2030, the less CO2 can be emitted thereafter to stay within a remaining carbon budget and below a warming limit. Scenarios with immediate action to observe the warming limit give the longest time to exhaust the associated remaining carbon budget and reach net zero CO2 emissions (see light blue lines in Figure 3.29 and Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter). In comparison, following projected NDC emissions until 2030 would imply a more pronounced drop in emissions from 2030 levels to net zero to make up for the additional near-term emissions (see orange lines in Figure 3.29). If such a drop does not occur, the remaining carbon budget is exceeded and net negative CO2 emissions are required to return global mean temperature below the warming limit (see black lines in Figure 3.29) (Clarke et al. 2014; Fuss et al. 2014; Rogelj et al. 2018 a).Figure 3.29 | Illustration of emissions and climate response in four mitigation pathways with different assumptions about near-term policy developments, global warming limit and non-CO2 warming contribution drawn from Riahiet al.  (2021).  Shown are  (a)  CO2 emissions trajectories,  (b)  cumulative CO2 emissions,  (c)  effective non-CO2 radiative forcing, and  (d)  the resulting estimate of the 67th percentile of global mean temperature response relative to 1850–1900. Light blue lines show a scenario that acts immediately on a remaining carbon budget of 900 GtCO2 from 2020 without allowing net negative CO2 emissions (i.e., temporary budget overshoot) (COFFEE 1.1, Scenario EN_NPi2020_900). Orange and black lines show scenarios drawn from the same model that follow the NDCs until 2030 and thereafter introduce action to stay within the same budget – in one case excluding net negative CO2 emissions like before (orange lines; COFFEE 1.1., Scenario EN-INDCi2030_900) and in the other allowing for a temporary overshoot of the carbon budget until 2100 (black lines; COFFEE 1.1., Scenario EN-INDCi2030_900f). Light blue lines describe a scenario following the NDCs until 2030, and then aiming for a higher budget of 2300 GtCO2 without overshoot (AIM/CGE 2.2, Scenario EN-INDCi2030_1200). It is drawn from another model which projects a lower anthropogenic non-CO2 forcing contribution and therefore achieves about the same temperature outcome as the other two non-overshoot scenarios despite the higher CO2 budget. Grey funnels include the trajectories from all scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) (category C3). Historical CO2 emissions until 2019 are from Chapter SM.2.1 EDGAR v6.0.Open figure The relationship between warming limits and near-term action is also affected by the warming contribution of non-CO2 greenhouse gases and other short-lived climate forcers (Section 3.3; AR6 WGI Section 6.7). The estimated budget values for limiting warming to 1.5°C–2°C already assume stringent reductions in non-CO2 greenhouse gases and non-CO2 climate forcing as found in 1.5°C–2°C pathways (Section 3.3 and Cross-Working Group Box 1 in this chapter; AR6 WGI Section 5.5 and Box 5.2 in Chapter 5). Further variations in non-CO2 warming observed across 1.5°C–2°C pathways can vary the median estimate for the remaining carbon budget by 220 GtCO2 (AR6 WGI Section 5.5). In 1.5°C–2°C pathways, the non-CO2 warming contribution differs strongly between the near, medium and long term. Changes to the atmospheric composition of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) dominate the warming response in the near term (AR6 WGI Section 6.7). CO2 reductions are combined with strong reductions in air pollutant emissions due to rapid reduction in fossil fuel combustion and in some cases the assumption of stringent air quality policies (Rao et al. 2017b; Smith et al. 2020c). As air pollutants exert a net-cooling effect, their reduction drives up non-CO2 warming in the near term, which can be attenuated by the simultaneous reduction of methane and black carbon (Shindell and Smith 2019; Smith et al. 2020b) (AR6 WGI Section 6.7). After 2030, the reduction in methane concentrations and associated reductions in tropospheric ozone levels tend to dominate so that a peak and decline in non-CO2 forcing and non-CO2-induced warming can occur before net zero CO2 is reached (Figure 3.29) (Rogelj et al. 2018 a). The more stringent the reductions in methane and other short-lived warming agents such as black carbon, the lower this peak and the earlier the decline of non-CO2 warming, leading to a reduction of warming rates and overall warming in the near to medium term (Harmsen et al. 2020; Smith et al. 2020b). This is important for keeping warming below a tight warming limit that is already reached around mid-century as is the case in 1.5°C pathways (Xu and Ramanathan 2017). Early and deep reductions of methane emissions, and other short-lived warming agents such as black carbon, provide space for residual CO2-induced warming until the point of net zero CO2 emissions is reached (see purple lines in Figure 3.29). Such emissions reductions have also been advocated due to co-benefits for, for example, reducing air pollution (Rao et al. 2016; Shindell et al. 2017a, 2018; Shindell and Smith 2019; Rauner et al. 2020a; Vandyck et al. 2020).The relationship between long-term climate goals and near-term action is further constrained by social, technological, economic and political factors (Cherp et al. 2018; van Sluisveld et al. 2018b; Aghion et al. 2019; Mercure et al. 2019; Trutnevyte et al. 2019b; Jewell and Cherp 2020). These factors influence path dependency and transition speed (Pahle et al. 2018; Vogt-Schilb et al. 2018). While detailed integrated assessment modelling of global mitigation pathways accounts for technology inertia (Bertram et al. 2015a; Mercure et al. 2018) and technology innovation and diffusion (Wilson et al. 2013; van Sluisveld et al. 2018a; Luderer et al. 2021), there are limitations in capturing socio-technical and political drivers of innovation, diffusion and transition processes (Gambhir et al. 2019; Köhler et al. 2019; Hirt et al. 2020; Keppo et al. 2021). Mitigation pathways show a wide range of transition speeds that have been interrogated in the context of socio-technical inertia (Gambhir et al. 2017; Kefford et al. 2018; Kriegler et al. 2018a; Brutschin et al. 2021) vs accelerating technological change and self-enforcing socio-economic developments (Creutzig et al. 2017; Zenghelis 2019) (Section 3.8). Diagnostic analysis of detailed IAMs found a lag of 8–20 years between the convergence of emissions pricing and the convergence of emissions response after a period of differentiated emission prices (Harmsen et al. 2021). This provides a measure of the inertia to changing policy signals in the model response. It is about half the time scale of 20–40 years observed for major energy transitions (Grubb et al. 2021). Hence, the mitigation pathways assessed here capture socio-technical inertia in reducing emissions, but the limited modelling of socio-political factors may alter the extent and persistence of this inertia.
