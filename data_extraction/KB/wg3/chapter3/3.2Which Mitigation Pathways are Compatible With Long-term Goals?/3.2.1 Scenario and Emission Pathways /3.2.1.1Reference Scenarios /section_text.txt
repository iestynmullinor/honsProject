It is common to define a reference scenario (also called a baseline scenario). Depending on the research question, a reference scenario could be defined in different ways (Grant et al. 2020): (i) a hypothetical world with no climate policies or climate impacts (Kriegler et al. 2014b), (ii) assuming current policies or pledged policies are implemented (Roelfsema et al. 2020), or (iii) a mitigation scenario to compare sensitivity with other mitigation scenarios (Kriegler et al. 2014a; Sognnaes et al. 2021).No-climate-policy reference scenarios have often been compared with mitigation scenarios (Clarke et al. 2014). A no-climate-policy scenario assumes that no future climate policies are implemented, beyond what is in the model calibration, effectively implying that the carbon price is zero. No-climate-policy reference scenarios have a broad range depending on socio-economic assumptions and model characteristics, and consequently are important when assessing mitigation costs (Riahi et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018 b). As countries move forward with climate policies of varying stringency, no-climate-policy baselines are becoming increasingly hypothetical (Hausfather and Peters 2020). Studies clearly show current policies are having an effect, particularly when combined with the declining costs of low-carbon technologies (IEA 2020a; Roelfsema et al. 2020; Sognnaes et al. 2021; UNEP 2020), and, consequently, realised trajectories begin to differ from earlier no-climate-policy scenarios (Burgess et al. 2020). High-end emission scenarios, such as RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5, are becoming less likely with climate policy and technology change (Box 3.3), but high-end concentration and warming levels may still be reached with the inclusion of strong carbon or climate feedbacks (Hausfather and Peters 2020; Pedersen et al. 2020).
