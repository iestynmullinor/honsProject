Chapter 3 is linked to many other chapters in the report. The most important connections exist with Chapter 4 on mitigation and development pathways in the near to mid-term; with the sectoral chapters (Chapters 6–11); with the chapters dealing with cross-cutting issues (Chapters 12 and 17, e.g., feasibility); and finally also with AR6 WGI and WGII.Within the overall framing of the AR6 report, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 provide important complementary views of the required systems transitions across different temporal and spatial scales. While Chapter 3 focuses on the questions concerning the implications of the long-term objectives for the medium-to-near-term transformations, Chapter 4 comes from the other direction, and focuses on current near-term trends and policies (such as the Nationally Determined Contributions – NDCs) and their consequences with regards to GHG emissions. The latter chapter naturally focuses much more on the regional and national dimensions, and the heterogeneity of current and planned policies. Bringing together the information from these two chapters enables the assessment of whether current and planned actions are consistent with the required systems changes for the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement.Important other linkages comprise the collaboration with the ‘sectoral’ Chapters 6 to 11 to provide an integrated cross-sectoral perspective. This information (including information also from the sectoral chapters) is taken up ultimately also by Chapter 5 on demand/services and Chapter 12 for a further assessment of sectoral potential and costs.Linkages to other chapters exist also on the topic of feasibility, which are informed by the policy, the sectoral and the demand chapters, the technology and finance chapters, as well as Chapter 4 on national circumstances.Close collaboration with WGI permitted the use of AR6-calibrated emulators, which assure full consistency across the different working groups. Linkages to WGII concern the assessment of macroeconomic benefits of avoided impacts that are put into the context of mitigation costs as well as co-benefits and trade-offs for sustainable development.
