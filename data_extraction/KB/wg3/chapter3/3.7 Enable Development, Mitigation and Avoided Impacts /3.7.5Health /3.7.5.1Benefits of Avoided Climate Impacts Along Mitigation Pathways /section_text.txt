The human health chapter of the WGII contribution to the AR6 concluded that climate change is increasingly affecting a growing number of health outcomes, with negative net impacts at the global scale and positive impacts only in a few limited situations. There are few estimates of economic costs of increases in climate-sensitive health outcomes. In the USA in 2012, the financial burden in terms of deaths, hospitalisations, and emergency department visits for ten climate-sensitive events across 11 states were estimated to be 10 (2.7â€“24.6) billion USD2018 (Limaye et al. 2019).
