Climate change alters the production of energy through changes in temperature (hydropower, fossil fuel, nuclear, solar, bioenergy, transmission and pipelines), precipitation (hydropower, fossil fuel, nuclear and bioenergy), windiness (wind and wave), and cloudiness (solar) ( high confidence). Increases in temperature reduce efficiencies of thermal power plants (e.g., fossil fuel and nuclear plants) with air-cooled condensers by 0.4–0.7% per °C increase in ambient temperature (Cronin et al. 2018a; Simioni and Schaeffer 2019; Yalew, S.G. et al. 2020). Potentials and costs for renewable energy technologies are also affected by climate change, though with considerable regional variation and uncertainty (Gernaat et al. 2021). Biofuel yields could increase or decrease depending on the level of warming, changes in precipitation, and the effect of CO2 fertilisation (Calvin et al. 2013; Kyle et al. 2014; Gernaat et al. 2021). Coastal energy facilities could potentially be impacted by sea level rise (Brown et al. 2014).The energy sector uses large volumes of water (Fricko et al. 2016), making it highly vulnerable to climate change (Tan and Zhi 2016) ( high confidence). Thermoelectric and hydropower sources are the most vulnerable to water stress (van Vliet et al. 2016). Restricted water supply to these power sources can affect grid security and affordable energy access (Koch et al. 2014; Ranzani et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018d).The hydropower facilities from high mountain areas of Central Europe, Iceland, Western USA/Canada, and Latin America (Hock et al. 2019), as well as Africa and China (Bartos and Chester 2015; Gaupp et al. 2015; Tarroja et al. 2016; Conway et al. 2017; Byers et al. 2018; Eyer and Wichman 2018; Ranzani et al. 2018; Savelsberg et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018d; Zhou et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2019) have experienced changes in seasonality and availability.
