Many co-benefits to urban mitigation actions (Chapter 8, Section 8.2.1) improve the liveability of cities and contribute to achieving SDG 11. In particular, compact urban form, efficient technologies and infrastructure can play a valuable role in mitigation by reducing energy demand (Creutzig et al. 2016; Güneralp et al. 2017), thus averting carbon lock-in, while reducing land sprawl and hence increasing carbon storage and biodiversity (D’Amour et al. 2017). Benefits of mitigation include air quality improvements from decreased traffic and congestion when private vehicles are displaced by other modes; health benefits from increases in active travel; and lowered urban heat island effects from green-blue infrastructures (Section 8.2.1).However, increasing urban density or enlarging urban green spaces can increase property prices and reduce affordability (Section 8.2.1). Raising living conditions for slum dwellers and people living in informal settlements will require significant materials and energy; however, regeneration can be conducted in ways that avoid carbon-intense infrastructure lock-in (Chapters 8 and 9). Cities affect other regions through supply chains (Marinova et al. 2020).Sustainable production, consumption and management of natural resources are consistent with, and necessary for, mitigation (Chapters 5 and 11). Demand-side measures can lower requirements for upstream material and energy use (Chapter 5). In terms of industrial production, transformational changes across sectors will be necessary for mitigation (Sections 11.3 and 11.4).Addressing multiple SDG arenas requires new systemic thinking in the areas of governance and policy, such as those proposed by Sachs et al. (2019).
