Climate change is a major driver of species extinction and terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems destruction ( high confidence) (AR6 WGII Chapter 2). Analysis shows that approximately half of all species with long-term records have shifted their ranges in elevation and about two thirds have advanced their timing of spring events (Parmesan and Hanley 2015). Under 3.2°C warming, 49% of insects, 44% of plants and 26% of vertebrates are projected to be at risk of extinction. At 2°C, this falls to 18% of insects, 16% of plants and 8% of vertebrates and at 1.5°C, to 6% of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates (Warren et al. 2018). Incidents of migration of invasive species, including pests and diseases, are also attributable to climate change, with negative impacts on food security and vector-borne diseases. Moreover, if climate change reduces crop yields, cropland may expand – a primary driver of biodiversity loss – in order to meet food demand (Molotoks et al. 2020). Land restoration and halting land degradation under all mitigation scenarios has the potential for synergy between mitigation and adaptation.
