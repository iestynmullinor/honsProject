Marine ecosystems are being affected by climate change and growing non-climate pressures including temperature change, acidification, land-sourced pollution, sedimentation, resource extraction and habitat destruction ( high confidence) (Bindoff et al. 2019; IPCC 2019b). The impacts of climate drivers and their combinations vary across taxa (AR6 WGII Chapter 3). The danger or warming and acidification to coral reefs, rocky shores and kelp forests is well established ( high confidence) (AR6 WGII Chapter 3). Migration towards optimal thermal and chemical conditions (Burrows et al. 2019) contributes to large-scale redistribution of fish and invertebrate populations, and major impacts on global marine biomass production and maximum sustainable yield (Bindoff et al. 2019).
