By 2100, urban population will be almost double and more urban areas will be built (Jiang and Oâ€™Neill 2017), although COVID-19 may modify these trends (Kii 2021). Urbanisation will amplify projected air temperature changes in cities, including amplifying heatwaves (AR6 WGI Chapter 10, Box 10.3). Benefits of climate mitigation in urban areas include reducing heat, air pollution and flooding. Industrial infrastructure and production-consumption supply networks also benefit from avoided impacts.
