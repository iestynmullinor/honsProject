Global precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff and water availability increase with warming (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Greve et al. 2018) (AR6 WGII Chapter 4). Climate change also affects the occurrence of and exposure to hydrological extremes ( high confidence) (Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Asadieh and Krakauer 2017; Dottori et al. 2018; Naumann et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a; Do et al. 2020) (AR6 WGII Chapter 4). Climate models project increases in precipitation intensity ( high confidence), local flooding (medium confidence), and drought risk (very high confidence) (Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Asadieh and Krakauer 2017; Dottori et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a) (AR6 WGII Chapter 4).The effect of climate change on water availability and hydrological extremes varies by region ( high confidence) due to differences in the spatial patterns of projected precipitation changes (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Schewe et al. 2014; Schlosser et al. 2014; Asadieh and Krakauer 2017; Dottori et al. 2018; Naumann et al. 2018; Koutroulis et al. 2019) (AR6 WGII Chapter 4). Global exposure to water stress is projected to increase with increased warming, but increases will not occur in all regions (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Schewe et al. 2014; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Gosling and Arnell 2016; IPCC 2019a).Limiting warming could reduce water-related risks ( high confidence) (Oâ€™Neill et al. 2017b; Byers et al. 2018; Hurlbert et al. 2019) (AR6 WGII Chapter 4) and the population exposed to increased water stress (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Schewe et al. 2014; Gosling and Arnell 2016; IPCC 2019a).The effect of climate change on water depends on the climate model, the hydrological model, and the metric ( high confidence) stress Hanasaki et al. (2013); Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes (2014); Schewe et al. (2014); Schlosser et al. (2014); Gosling and Arnell (2016); IPCC (2019a).However, the effect of socio-economic development could be larger than the effect of climate change ( high confidence) (Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Schlosser et al. 2014; Graham et al. 2020).Climate change can also affect water quality (both thermal and chemical) (Liu et al. 2017), leading to increases in stream temperature and nitrogen loading in rivers (Ballard et al. 2019).
