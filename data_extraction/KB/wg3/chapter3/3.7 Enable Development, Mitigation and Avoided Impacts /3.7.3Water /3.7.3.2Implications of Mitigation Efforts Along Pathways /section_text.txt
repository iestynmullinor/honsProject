The effects of mitigation on water demand depends on the mitigation technologies deployed ( high confidence) (Chaturvedi et al. 2013a,b; Hanasaki et al. 2013; Kyle et al. 2013; Hejazi et al. 2014; Bonsch et al. 2016; Jakob and Steckel 2016; Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Fujimori et al. 2017; Maïzi et al. 2017; Bijl et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2018; Graham et al. 2018; Parkinson et al. 2019). Some mitigation options could increase water consumption (volume removed and not returned) while decreasing withdrawals (total volume of water removed, some of which may be returned) (Kyle et al. 2013; Fricko et al. 2016; Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Parkinson et al. 2019). Bioenergy and BECCS can increase water withdrawals and water consumption ( high confidence) (Chaturvedi et al. 2013a; Kyle et al. 2013; Hejazi et al. 2014; Bonsch et al. 2016; Jakob and Steckel 2016; Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Fujimori et al. 2017; Maïzi et al. 2017; Séférian et al. 2018; Yamagata et al. 2018; Parkinson et al. 2019) (AR6 WGII Chapter 4). DACCS (Fuhrman et al. 2020) and CCS (Kyle et al. 2013; Fujimori et al. 2017) could increase water demand; however, the implications of CCS depend on the cooling technology and when capture occurs (Magneschi et al. 2017; Maïzi et al. 2017; Giannaris et al. 2020). Demand-side mitigation (e.g., dietary change, reduced food waste, reduced energy demand) can reduce water demand (Bajželj et al. 2014; Aleksandrowicz et al. 2016; Green et al. 2018; Springmann et al. 2018). Introducing specific measures (e.g., environmental flow requirements, improved efficiency, priority rules) can reduce water withdrawals (Bertram et al. 2018; Bijl et al. 2018; Parkinson et al. 2019).The effect of mitigation on water quality depends on the mitigation option, its implementation, and the aspect of quality considered ( high confidence) (Ng et al. 2010; Flörke et al. 2019; Sinha et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019; Fuhrman et al. 2020; Karlsson et al. 2020; McElwee et al. 2020).
