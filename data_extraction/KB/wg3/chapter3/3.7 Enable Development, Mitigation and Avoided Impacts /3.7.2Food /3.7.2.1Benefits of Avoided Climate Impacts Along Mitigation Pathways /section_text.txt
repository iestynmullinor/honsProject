Climate change will reduce crop yields, increase food insecurity, and negatively influence nutrition and mortality ( high confidence) (AR6 WGII Chapter 5). Climate mitigation will thus reduce these impacts, and hence reduce food insecurity ( high confidence). The yield reduction of global food production will increase food insecurity and influence nutrition and mortality (Hasegawa et al. 2014; Springmann et al. 2016a). For instance, Springmann et al. (2016a) estimate that climate change could lead to 315,000â€“736,000 additional deaths by 2050, though these could mostly be averted by stringent mitigation efforts. Reducing warming reduces the impacts of climate change, including extreme climates, on food production and risk of hunger (Hasegawa et al. 2014, 2021b).
