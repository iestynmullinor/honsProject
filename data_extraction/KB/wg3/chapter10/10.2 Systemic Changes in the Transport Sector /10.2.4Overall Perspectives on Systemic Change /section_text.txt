The interactions between systemic factors set out here and technology factors discussed in much more detail in the next sections show that there is always going to be a need to integrate both approaches. Good technology that has the potential to transform transport will not be used unless it fulfils broad mobility and accessibility objectives related to time, cost, and well-being. Chapter 5 has set out three transport transformations based on demand-side factors with highly transformative potential. Table 10.3 provides a summary of these systemic changes and their likely impact on GHG emissions. Note that the quantitative estimates provided in the table may not be additive and the combined effect of these strategies on GHG emissions from the transport sector require additional analysis.
