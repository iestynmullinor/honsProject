Maritime transport volume has increased by 250% over the past 40 years, reaching an all-time high of 11 billion tonnes of transported goods in 2018 (UNCTAD 2019). This growth in transport volumes has resulted in continued growth in GHG emissions from the shipping sector, despite an improvement in the carbon intensity of ship operations, especially since 2014. The estimated total emissions from maritime transport can vary depending on data set and calculation method, but range over 600–1100 MtCO2 yr –1 over the past decade (Figure 10.14), corresponding to 2–3% of total anthropogenic emissions.
