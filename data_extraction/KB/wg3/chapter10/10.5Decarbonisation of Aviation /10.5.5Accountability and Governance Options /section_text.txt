Under Article 2.2 of the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I countries were called to ‘…pursue limitation or reduction of emissions of GHGs not controlled by the Montreal Protocol from aviation and marine bunker fuels, working through the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization, respectively. ’ The Paris Agreement is different, in that ICAO (and the IMO) are not named. As a result, the Paris Agreement, through the NDCs, seemingly covers CO2 emissions from domestic aviation (currently 35% of the global total from aviation) but does not cover emissions from international flights. A number of states and regions, including the UK, France, Sweden, and Norway, have declared their intentions to include international aviation in their net zero commitments, while the EU, New Zealand, California, and Denmark are considering doing the same (Committee on Climate Change 2019). The Paris Agreement describes temperature-based goals, such that it is unclear how emissions of GHGs from international aviation would be accounted for. Clearly, this is a less than ideal situation for clarity of governance of international GHG emissions from both aviation and shipping. At its 40th General Assembly (October 2019) the ICAO requested its Council to ‘…continue to explore the feasibility of a long-term global aspirational goal for international aviation, through conducting detailed studies assessing the attainability and impacts of any goals proposed, including the impact on growth as well as costs in all countries, especially developing countries, for the progress of the work to be presented to the 41st Session of the ICAO Assembly’. What form this goal will take is unclear until work is presented to the 41st Assembly (Autumn, 2022). It is likely , however, that new accountability and governance structures will be needed to support decarbonisation of the aviation sector.
