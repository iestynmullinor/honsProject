Aviation is widely recognised as a ‘hard-to-decarbonise’ sector (Gota et al. 2019) having a strong dependency on liquid fossil fuels and an infrastructure that has long ‘lock-in’ timescales, resulting in slow fleet turnover times. The principal GHG emitted is CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuel aviation kerosene (‘Jet-A’), although its non-CO­2 emissions can also affect climate (Section 10.5.2). International emissions of CO2 are about 65% of the total emissions from aviation (Fleming and de Lépinay 2019), which totalled approximately 1 Gt of CO2 in 2018. Emissions from this segment of the transport sector have been steadily increasing at rates of around 2.5% per year  over the last two decades (Figure 10.10), although for the period 2010 to 2018 the rate increased to roughly 4% per year. The latest available data (2018) indicate that aviation is responsible for approximately 2.4% of total anthropogenic emissions of CO2 (including land-use change) on an annual basis (using IEA data, IATA data and global emissions data of Le Quéré et al. (2018b)).Figure 10.10 | Historical global emissions of CO2from aviation, along with capacity and transport work (given in available seat kilometres, ASK; revenue passenger-kilometres, RPK).
