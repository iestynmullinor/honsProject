The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations (UN) has renewed international efforts to pursue and accurately measure global actions towards sustainable development (United Nations 2015). The 17 SDGs set out the overall goals that are further specified by 169 targets and 232 SDG indicators, many of which relate to transport (United Nations 2017; Lisowski et al. 2020). A sustainable transport system provides safe, inclusive, affordable, and clean passenger and freight mobility for current and future generations (Williams 2017; Litman 2021) so transport is particularly linked to SDGs 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 (Move Humanity 2018; IRP 2019; WBA 2019; SLoCaT 2019; Yin 2019). Table 10.1 summarises transport-related topics for these SDGs and corresponding research. Section 17.3.3.7 also provides a cross-sectoral overview of synergies and trade-offs between climate change mitigation and the SDGs.Table 10.1 | Transport and the Sustainable Development Goals: Synergies and trade-offs.
