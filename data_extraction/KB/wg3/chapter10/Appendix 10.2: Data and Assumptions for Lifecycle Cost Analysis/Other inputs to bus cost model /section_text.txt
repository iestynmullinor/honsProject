For buses, a 40-foot North American transit bus with a passenger capacity of 50, lifetime of 15 years, and an annual distance travelled of 72,400 km based on data in the ANL AFLEET model (Argonne National Laboratory 2020) is assumed. Maintenance costs were assumed to be USD0.63 per km for ICEV buses and USD0.38 per km for BEV and ICEV buses, also based on data from the AFLEET model (Argonne National Laboratory 2020). For ICEV and BEV purchase costs, data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Johnson et al. 2020) is used for bounding ranges (USD430,000 to 500,000 for ICEV and USD579,000 to 1,200,000 for BEV), which encompass the default values from AFLEET model (Argonne National Laboratory 2020). Note that wider ranges are available in the literature (e.g., as low as USD120,000 per bus in Burnham et al. (2021) and Harris et al. (2020)); but these are not included in the sensitivity analysis to avoid conflating disparate vehicles. For FCV buses, the upper bound of the purchase price range (USD1,200,000) represents current costs in the US (Argonne National Laboratory 2020; Eudy and Post 2020), and the lower bound represents the target future value from the US Department of Energy (Eudy and Post 2020).
