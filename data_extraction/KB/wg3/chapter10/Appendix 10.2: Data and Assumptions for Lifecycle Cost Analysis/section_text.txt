Capital cost ranges vary widely in the literature depending on the exact truck model, size and other assumptions. For ICEVs in this analysis, the lower bound (USD90,000) corresponds to the 2020 estimate for China from Moultak et al. (2017), and the upper bound (USD250,000) corresponds to the 2030 projection for the US from the same study. These values encompass the full range reported by Argonne (Burnham et al. 2021). The lower bound BEV cost (USD120,000) is taken from 2030 projections for China (Moultak et al. 2017) and the upper bound (USD780,000) is taken from 2020 cost estimates in the US (class 8 sleeper cab tractor) (Burnham et al. 2021). The lower bound for FCV trucks (USD130,000) corresponds to the 2050 estimate for class 8 sleeper cab tractors from Argonne National Laboratory and the upper bound (USD290,000) corresponds to the 2020 estimate from the same study (Burnham et al. 2021). These values span the full range reported by Moultak et al. (2017) for the US, Europe and China from 2020–2030.The analysis uses a truck lifetime of 10 years and annual distance travelled of 140,000 km based on Burnham et al. (2021). An effective payload of 17 tonnes (80% of maximum payload of 21 tonnes) is assumed based on reported average effective payload submitted by Argonne National Laboratory in response to the IPCC LCA data collection call. A discount rate of 3% is used, based on Burnham et al. (2021) and consistent with the social discount rate from Chapter 3. Maintenance costs are assumed to be USD0.15 km –1 for ICEV trucks and USD0.09 km –1 for BEV and FCV trucks, as reported in Burnham et al. (2021).
