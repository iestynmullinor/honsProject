For freight and passenger rail, powertrain and vehicle operation and maintenance costs in USD per km from the IEA Future of Rail report (IEA 2019e) (IEA Figure 2.14 for passenger rail and IEA Figure 2.15 for freight rail) are used as a proxy for non-fuel costs. The ranges span conservative and forward-looking cases. In addition, the range for BEV rail ranges encompass short- and long-distance trains – corresponding to 100–200 km for passenger rail, and 400–750 km for freight rail. Note that all values exclude the base vehicle costs, but they are expected not to be significant as they are amortised over the lifetime distance travelled. For freight rail, a network that is representative of North America is assumed, with a payload of 2800 tonnes per train (IEA Figure 1.17), assumed to be utilised at 100%, with a lifetime of 10 years, and an average distance travelled of 120,000 km yr –1. For BEV freight rail, the range in powertrain costs is driven by battery costs of USD250–600 kWh –1, while for FCV freight rail, the range in powertrain costs is driven by fuel cell stack costs of USD50–1000 kW–1. For passenger rail, a network that is representative of Europe is assumed, with an average occupancy of 180 passengers per train (IEA Figure 1.14), with a lifetime of 10 years, and an average distance travelled of 115,000 km per year.
