For diesel, a range of USD0.5–2.5 per litre is used based on historic diesel costs across all OECD countries reported in the IEA Energy Prices and Taxes Statistics database (IEA 2021c) since 2010. The lower end of this range is consistent with the minimum projected value from the 2021 US Annual Energy Outlook (low oil price scenario, USD0.55 l –1) (US Energy Information Administration 2021). The upper end of the range encompasses both the maximum diesel price observed in the 2021 US Annual Energy Outlook projections (high oil price scenario, USD1.5 l –1) (US Energy Information Administration 2021), and the diesel price that would correspond to the 2020 IEA World Energy Outlook crude oil price projections (Stated Policies scenario) (IEA 2020b), assuming the historical price relationship between crude oil and diesel is maintained (USD1.5 l –1). For reference, the IEA reports current world-average automotive diesel costs to be around 1 USD l –1 (IEA 2021d). The selected range also captures the current range of production costs for values for bio-based and synthetic diesels (EUR51–144 MWh –1, corresponding to USD0.6–1.70 l –1), which are generally still higher than wholesale petroleum diesel costs (EUR30–50 MWh –1, corresponding to USD0.35–0.6 l –1), as reported by IEA (IEA 2020c). This range also encompasses costs for synthesised electrofuels from electrolytic hydrogen, as reported in Chapter 6 (USD1.6 l –1).The range of electricity costs used here is consistent with the range of levelised cost of electricity estimates presented in Chapter 6 (USD20–200 MWh –1).For hydrogen, a range of USD1 to USD13 per kilogram is used. The upper end of this range corresponds approximately to reported retail costs in the US (Eudy and Post 2018b; Argonne National Laboratory 2020; Burnham et al. 2021). Despite the high upper bound, lower costs (USD6–7 kg –1) are already consistent with recent cost estimates of hydrogen produced via electrolysis (Chapter 6) and current production cost estimates from IRENA (IRENA 2020). The lower end of the range (USD1 kg –1) corresponds to projected future price decreases for electrolytic hydrogen (BNEF 2020; Hydrogen Council 2020; IRENA 2020), and is consistent with projections from Chapter 6 for the low end of long-term future prices for fossil hydrogen with CCS.
