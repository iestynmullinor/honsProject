In mid-2020, the IPCC, in collaboration with the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, released a request for data from the lifecycle assessment (LCA) community, to estimate the lifecycle greenhouse (GHG) emissions of various passenger and freight transport pathways. The data requested included information about vehicle and fuel types, vintages, vehicle efficiency, payload, emissions from vehicle and battery manufacturing, and fuel cycle emissions factors, among others.Data submissions were received from approximately 20 research groups, referencing around 30 unique publications. These submissions were supplemented by an additional 20 studies from the literature. While much of this literature was focused on LDVs and trucks, relatively few studies referenced bus and rail pathways.
