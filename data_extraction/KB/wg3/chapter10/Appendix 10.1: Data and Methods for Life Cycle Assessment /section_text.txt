First, the datapoints were separated into categories based on the approximate classification (e.g., heavy-duty vs medium-duty trucks), powertrain (i.e., internal combustion engines (ICEV), hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), battery electric vehicles (BEV), fuel cell vehicles (FCV)), and fuel combination. For each category of vehicle/powertrain/fuel, a simplified LCA that harmonises values from across the reviewed studies was constructed, using the following basic equation:Where:•Lifecycle GHG intensity represents the normalised lifecycle GHG emissions associated with each transportation mode, measured in gCO2-eq per passenger-kilometre (pkm)or gCO2-eq per tonne-kilometre (tkm).•FC is the fuel consumption of the vehicle in megajoules (MJ) or kilowatt hours (kWh) per km.•P represents the payload (measured in tonnes of cargo) or number of passengers, at a specified utilisation capacity (e.g., 50% payload or 80% occupancy).•EF is an emissions factor representing the lifecycle GHG intensity of the fuel used, measured in gCO2-eq MJ–1 or gCO2-eq kWh –1. A single representative EF value is selected for each fuel type. When a given fuel type can be generated in different ways with substantially different upstream emissions factors (e.g., hydrogen from methane steam reforming vs hydrogen from water electrolysis), these are treated as two different fuel categories. The fuel emissions factors that were used are presented in Table 10.8.•VC are the vehicle cycle emissions of the vehicle, measured in gCO2-eq per vehicle. This may include vehicle manufacturing, maintenance and end of life, or just manufacturing.•LVKT is the lifetime vehicle kilometres travelled.Note: for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), the value of FC/P*EF is a weighted sum of this aggregate term for each of battery and diesel/gasoline operation.Fuel emissions factors used are presented in Table 10.8. Note that the fuel emissions factors were compiled from several studies that used different global warming potential (GWP) values in their underlying assumptions, and therefore the numbers reported here may be slightly different if the 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) from the AR6 had been used. This difference would be small given the small contribution from non-CO2 gases to the total lifecycle emissions. For example, methane (CH4) emissions exist in the lifecycle of natural gas supply chains or natural gas-dependent supply chains such as hydrogen from steam methane reforming (SMR). Recent data from the US suggests emissions of approximately 0.2–0.3 gCH4 per MJ natural gas (Littlefield et al. 2017, 2019), which would range by no more than 1–2 gCO2-eq per MJ natural gas (<3% of natural gas lifecycle emissions) when converting from a GWP100 of 25 (AR4) or 36 (AR5) to the current (AR6) GWP100 of 29.8.For LDVs, the entire distribution of estimated lifecycle emissions is presented for each vehicle/powertrain/fuel category (as a boxplot) in Figure 10.4. For trucks, rail and buses, only the low and high estimates are presented (as solid bars) in Figures 10.6 and 10.8, since the number of datapoints were not sufficient to present as a distribution. Table 10.9 presents the low and high estimates of fuel efficiency for each category. The references used are reported in the main text.For transit and freight, the lifecycle harmonisation exercise allows two aggregate parameters to vary from the low to high among submitted values within each category: FC/P and VC/P. Aggregate parameters are used to capture internal correlations (e.g., fuel consumption and payload; both depend heavily on vehicle size) and are presented in Tables 10.10 to 10.14. The references used are reported in the main text.Table 10.8 | Fuel emissions factors used to estimate lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of passenger and freight transport pathways.
