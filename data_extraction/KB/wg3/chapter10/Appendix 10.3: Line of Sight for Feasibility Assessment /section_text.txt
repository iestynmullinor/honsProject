Regional supply/availability varies. Alternative chemistries exist; recycling may likewise alleviate critical material concerns. Similar supply constraints may exist for some renewable electricity sources (e.g., solar) required to support EVs. May reduce critical materials required for catalytic converters in ICEVs (e.g., platinum, palladium, rhodium).No major changes in land use for the vehicle. Potential increases in land use for electricity generation (especially solar, wind or hydropower) and mineral extraction, but may be partially offset by a decrease in land use for fossil fuel production; likely lower land use than crop-based biofuels, or technologies with higher electricity use (e.g., those based on electrolytic hydrogen).Line of sight IEA, 2021: Global EV Outlook 2021.

Evidence is mixed for other pollutants such as NOx. The biofuels supply chain (e.g., due to increased fertiliser use) may negatively impact air quality.Increased use of fertilisers and agrochemicals due to biofuel production may increase impacts in ecotoxicity and eutrophication; some biofuels may be less toxic than fossil fuel counterparts.Increasing production of biofuels may increase pressure on water resources due to the need for irrigation. However, some biofuel options may also improve these aspects in respect to conventional agriculture. These impacts will depend on specific local conditions.Additional land use for biofuels may increase pressure on biodiversity.

However, the combustion of ammonia could lead to elevated levels of nitrogen oxides and ammonia emissions.Ammonia is highly toxic, and therefore requires special handling procedures to avoid potentially catastrophic leaks into the environment. That said, large volumes of ammonia are already safely transported internationally due to a high level of understanding of safe handling procedures. Additionally, the use of ammonia in shipping presents a risk of eutrophication and ecotoxicity from the release of ammonia into the water system – either via a fuel leak or via unburnt ammonia emissions.May increase or decrease water footprint depending on the upstream energy source.Lack of studies assessing the potential impacts of the technology on biodiversity.Line of sight Bicer, Y. and I.

It is likely some ammonia will need to be mixed with a secondary fuel due its relatively low burning velocity and high ignition temperature. This would likely require existing powertrains to be modified to accept dual fuel mixes, including ammonia. Exhaust treatment systems are also required to deal with the release of unburnt ammonia emissions.Ammonia supply chains are well established; transport and storage more feasible than hydrogen; scalability of electrolytic production routes remains a challenge for producing low-GHG ammonia.The production, transport and storage of ammonia is mature based on existing international supply chains. The use of ammonia in ships is still at the early stages of research and development. Further research and development will be required for ammonia to be widely used in shipping, including improving the efficiency of combustion, and treatment of exhaust emissions.

Challenges exist with transport and distribution of hydrogen. Electrolytic hydrogen not currently produced at scale.The technology is already available to users for light-duty vehicle applications and buses, but further improvements in fuel cell technology are needed. Use in heavy-duty applications is currently constrained. Maturity and technology readiness level can vary for different parts of the supply chain, and is lower than for EVs.Line of sight Trencher, G., A. Taeihagh, and M.
