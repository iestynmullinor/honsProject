This section assesses studies based on the links between sustainable development and climate change mitigation in order to facilitate robust conclusions on synergies and trade-offs between different policy objectives across methodologies, scenarios and sectors. Conclusions are drawn based on national and sub-national, sectoral and cross-sectoral, short- and long-term transition studies presented in this and other sections of the report as a basis for establishing an overall picture of how sustainable development and climate change policies can be linked as a basis for accelerated transitions.This section focuses initially on issues related to short- and long-term transitions to meet climate change and sustainable development goals in the context of the UNFCCC and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Global-modelling results and economy-wide studies are then assessed, followed by a discussion of specific challenges in relation to renewable-energy penetration and phasing out fossil fuels, stranded assets and just transitions. Key synergies and trade-offs between meeting the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and mitigation are then illustrated by means of cross-sectoral examples. Finally, this section presents an overview of the assessment of SDG synergies and trade-offs based on all sectoral chapters in this report for a range of key mitigation options.
