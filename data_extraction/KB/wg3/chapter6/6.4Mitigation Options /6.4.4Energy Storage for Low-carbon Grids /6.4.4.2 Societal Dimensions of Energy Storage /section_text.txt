Public awareness and knowledge about electricity storage technologies, their current state, and their potential role in future energy systems is limited (Jones et al. 2018). For instance, people do not perceive energy system flexibility and storage as a significant issue, or assume storage is already taking place. Public perceptions differ across storage technologies. Hydrogen is considered a modern and clean technology, but people also have safety concerns. Moreover, the public is uncertain about hydrogen storage size and the possibility of storing hydrogen in or near residential areas (Eitan and Fischhendler 2021). Battery storage both on the household and community level was perceived as slightly positive in one study in the UK (Ambrosio-Albala et al. 2020). However, financial costs are seen as a main barrier. The potential of EV batteries to function as flexible storage is limited by the current numbers of EV owners and concerns that oneâ€™s car battery might not be fully loaded when needed.
