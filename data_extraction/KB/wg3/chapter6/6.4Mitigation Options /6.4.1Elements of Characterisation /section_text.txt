This section characterises energy system mitigation options and discusses which factors enable and inhibit their implementation. We touch on a broad range of factors that may enable and inhibit the implementation of mitigation options by considering six dimensions that affect their feasibility (Table 6.1 and Annex II.11). The assessment aims to identify which mitigation options can be readily implemented and which face barriers that would need to be overcome before they can be deployed at scale.Table 6.1 | Dimensions and indicators to assess the barriers and enablers of implementing mitigation options in low-carbon energy systems. MetricIndicatorsGeophysical: Are the required resources available?–Physical potential: physical constraints to implementation–Geophysical resources (including geological storage capacity): availability of resources needed for implementation–Land use: claims on land where an option would be implementedEnvironmental-ecological: What are the wider environmental and ecological impacts of the option?–Air pollution: increase or decrease in air pollutants, such as NH4, CH4 and fine dust–Toxic waste, ecotoxicity and eutrophication–Water quantity and quality: changes in the amount of water available for other uses–Biodiversity: changes in conserved primary forest or grassland that affect biodiversity, and management to conserve and maintain land carbon stocksTechnological: Can the required technology be upscaled soon?– Simplicity: is the option technically simple to operate, maintain and integrate?–Technology scalability: can the option be scaled up technically?–Maturity and technology readiness: research and development (R&D) and time needed to implement the optionEconomic: What economic conditions can support or inhibit the implementation of the option?–Costs in 2030 and in the long term: investment costs, costs in USD tCO2-eq –1–Employment effects and economic growth: decrease or increase in jobs and economic welfareSocio-cultural: What social conditions could support or inhibit acceptance, adoption, and use of the option before 2030?–Public acceptance: the extent to which the public supports the option and will change their behaviour accordingly–Effects on health and well-being–Distributional effects: equity and justice across groups, regions, and generations, including energy, water, and food security and povertyInstitutional: What institutional conditions could support or inhibit the implementation of the option?–Political acceptance: the extent to which politicians support the option–Institutional capacity and governance, cross-sectoral coordination: capability of institutions to implement and handle the option–Legal and administrative capacity
