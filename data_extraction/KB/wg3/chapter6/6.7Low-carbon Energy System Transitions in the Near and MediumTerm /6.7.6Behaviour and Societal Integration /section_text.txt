Public acceptability reflects the extent to which the public evaluates climate policy, mitigation options, and system changes (un)favourably, which can shape, enable, or prevent low-carbon energy system transitions. Public acceptability of policy and mitigation options is higher when people expect these have more positive and less negative consequences for self, others, and the environment (Perlaviciute and Steg 2014; Demski et al. 2015; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016). Public opposition may result when a culturally valued landscape is affected by renewable energy development (Warren et al. 2005; Devine-Wright and Howes 2010), particularly when place-based identities are threatened (Devine-Wright 2009, 2013; Boudet 2019). Acceptability can increase after a policy or change has been implemented and the consequences appear to be more positive than expected (Schuitema et al. 2010; Eliasson 2014; Weber 2015; Carattini et al. 2018); effective policy trials can thus build public support.Next, climate policy and low-carbon options are evaluated as more fair and acceptable when costs and benefits are distributed equally, and when nature, the environment and future generations are protected (Schuitema et al. 2011; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016). Compensating affected groups for losses due to policy or systems changes enhanced public acceptability in some cases (Perlaviciute and Steg 2014), but people may disagree on which compensation would be worthwhile (Aitken 2010b; Cass et al. 2010), on the distribution of compensation (Devine-Wright and Sherry-Brennan 2019; Leer Jørgensen et al. 2020), or feel they are being bribed (Cass et al. 2010; Perlaviciute and Steg 2014). Pricing policies are more acceptable when revenues are earmarked for environmental purposes (Steg et al. 2006; Sælen and Kallbekken 2011) or redistributed towards those affected (Schuitema and Steg 2008).Climate policy and mitigation options, such as renewable energy projects, are also perceived as more fair and acceptable when the public (Dietz 2013; Bidwell 2014; Bernauer et al. 2016b) or public society organisations (Terwel et al. 2010; Bernauer et al. 2016b) could participate in the decision-making (Arvai 2003; Devine-Wright 2005; Terwel et al. 2012; Walker and Baxter 2017; Perlaviciute and Squintani 2020). People are more motivated to participate in decision-making on local projects than on national or general policy goals (Perlaviciute and Squintani 2020). Public acceptability is also higher when people can influence major rather than only minor decisions, particularly when trust in responsible parties is low (Liu et al. 2019a). Public participation can enhance the quality and legitimacy of decisions by including local knowledge and views that may otherwise be missed (Dietz 2013; Bidwell 2016).Public support is higher when people trust responsible parties (Perlaviciute and Steg 2014; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016; Michaels and Parag 2016; Jiang et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019a). Public support for unilateral climate policy is rather strong and robust (Bernauer et al. 2016a), even in the absence of reciprocal commitments by other states (Bernauer and Gampfer 2015).Public acceptability of climate policy and low-carbon options differs across individuals. Climate policy and low-carbon options are more acceptable when people strongly value protecting other people and the environment, and support egalitarian worldviews, left-wing or green political ideologies, while acceptability is lower when people strongly endorse self-centred values, and support individualistic worldviews (Dietz et al. 2007; Perlaviciute and Steg 2014; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016). Similarly, public decision-makers support climate policy more when they endorse environmental values (Nilsson et al. 2016). Climate and energy policy is more acceptable when people are more concerned about climate change (Hornsey et al. 2016), when they believe their actions would help mitigate climate change, and feel responsible to mitigate climate change (Steg 2005; Eriksson et al. 2006; Jakovcevic and Steg 2013; Drews and Van den Bergh 2016; Kim and Shin 2017; Ünal et al. 2019).
