The digital economy, as well as shared and circular economy, is emerging as a template for great narratives, hopes and fears. Yet, there are few systematic evaluations of what is already happening and what can govern it towards a better narrative. Research needs to better gauge energy trends for rapidly evolving systems like data centres, increased use of social media and influence of consumption and choices, AI, blockchain; and implications of digital divides among social groups and countries on well-being. Governance decisions on AI, indirectly fostering either climate harming or climate mitigating activities remain unexplored. Better integration of mitigation models and consequential lifecycle analysis is needed for assessing how digitalisation, shared economy and circular economy change material and energy demand.
