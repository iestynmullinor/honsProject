In demand-side mitigation, governance is key to drive the multidimensional changes needed to meet service needs within a society that provide people with a decent living while increasingly reducing resource and energy input levels (Rojas-Rueda et al. 2012; Batchelor et al. 2018; OECD 2019a). Impartial governance, understood as equal treatment of everyone by the rule of law, creates social trust and is thus a key enabler of inclusive and participatory demand-side climate policies (Rothstein 2011). Inclusive and broad-based participation itself also leads to greater social trust and thus is also a key enabler of demand-side climate mitigation (Section 5.2). Higher social trust and inclusive participatory processes also reduce inequality, restrain opportunistic behaviour and enhance cooperation (Drews and van den Bergh 2016; GÃ¼r 2020) (Section 5.2). Altogether, broad-based participatory processes are central to the successful implementation of climate policies (Rothstein and Teorell 2008; Klenert et al. 2018) ( high evidence, medium agreement ). A culture of cooperation feeds back to increase social trust and enables action that reduce GHG emissions (Carattini et al. 2015; Jo and Carattini 2021), and requires including explicit consideration of the informal sector (Box 5.10). More equitable societies also have the institutional flexibility to allow for mitigation to advance faster, given their readiness to adopt locally-appropriate mitigation policies; they also suffer less from policy lock-in (Tanner et al. 2009; Lorenz 2013; Chu 2015; Cloutier et al. 2015; Martin 2016; Seto et al. 2016; Vandeweerdt et al. 2016; Turnheim et al. 2018).
