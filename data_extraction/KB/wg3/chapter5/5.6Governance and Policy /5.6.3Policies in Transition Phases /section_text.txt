Demand-side policies tend to vary for different transition phases ( high evidence, high agreement ) (Roberts and Geels 2019; Sandin et al. 2019). In the first phase, which is characterised by the emergence or introduction of radical innovations in small niches, policies focus on: (i) supporting R&D and demonstration projects to enable learning and capability developments, (ii) nurturing the building of networks and multi-stakeholder interactions, and (iii) providing future orientation through visions or targets (Brown et al. 2003; López-García et al. 2019; Roesler and Hassler 2019). In the second phase, the policy emphasis shifts towards upscaling of experiments, standardisation, cost reduction, and the creation of early market niches (Borghei and Magnusson 2018; Ruggiero et al. 2018). In the third and later phases, comprehensive policy mixes are used to stimulate mass adoption, infrastructure creation, social acceptance and business investment (Fichter and Clausen 2016; Geels et al. 2018; Strauch 2020). In the fourth phase, transitions can also be stimulated through policies that weaken or phase out existing regimes, such as removing inefficient subsidies (for cheap petrol or fuel oil) that encourage wasteful consumption, increasing taxes on carbon-intensive products and practices (Box 5.11), or substantially tightening regulations and standards (Kivimaa and Kern 2016; David 2017; Rogge and Johnstone 2017).
