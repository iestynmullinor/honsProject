The allocationof political power to incumbent actors and coalitions has contributed to lock-in of particular institutions, stabilising the interests of incumbents through networks that include policymakers, bureaucracies, advocacy groups and knowledge institutions ( high agreement, high evidence). There is  high evidence and  high agreement  that institutions are central in addressing climate change mitigation. Indeed, social provisioning contexts, including equity, democracy, public services and high quality infrastructure, are found to facilitate high levels of need satisfaction at lower energy use, whereas economic growth beyond moderate incomes and dependence on extractive industries inhibit it (Vogel et al. 2021). They shape and interact with technological systems (Unruh 2000; Foxon et al. 2004; Seto et al. 2014) and represent rules, norms and conventions that organise and structure actions (Vatn 2015) and help create new path dependency or strengthen existing path dependency (Mattioli et al. 2020) (see case studies in Boxes 5.5 to 5.8 and Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I). These drive behaviour of actors through formal (e.g., laws, regulations, and standards) or informal (e.g., norms, habits, and customs) processes, and can create constraints on policy options (Breukers and Wolsink 2007 ). For example, the car-dependent transport system is maintained by interlocking elements and institutions, consisting of (i) the automotive industry; (ii) the provision of car infrastructure; (iii) the political economy of urban sprawl; (iv) the provision of public transport; (v) cultures of car consumption (Mattioli et al. 2020). The behaviour of actors, their processes and implications on policy options and decisions are discussed further in Section 5.6.
