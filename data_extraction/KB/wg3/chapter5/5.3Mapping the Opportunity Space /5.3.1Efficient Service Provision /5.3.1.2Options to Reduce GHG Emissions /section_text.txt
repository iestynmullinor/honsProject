A systematic review of options to reduce the GHG emissions associated with household consumption activities identified 6,990 peer-reviewed journal papers, with 771 options that were aggregated into 61 consumption option categories (Ivanova et al. 2020) (Figure 5.8). Consistently with previous research (Herendeen and Tanaka 1976; Pachauri and Spreng 2002; Pachauri 2007; Ivanova et al. 2016), a hierarchical list of mitigation options emerges. Choosing low-carbon options, such as car-free living, plant-based diets with no or very little animal products, low-carbon sources of electricity and heating at home, as well as local holiday plans, can reduce an individualâ€™s carbon footprint by up to 9 tCO2-eq. Realising these options requires substantial policy support to overcome infrastructural, institutional and socio-cultural lock-in (Sections 5.4 and 5.6).Figure 5.8 | Synthesis of 60 demand-side options ordered by the median GHG mitigation potential found across all estimates from the literature. The grey crosses are averages. The boxes represent the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentiles of study results. The whiskers or dots show the minimum and maximum mitigation potentials of each option. Negative values (in the red area) represent the potentials for backfire due to rebound, i.e., a net increase of GHG emissions due to adopting the option. Source: with permission from Ivanova et al.
