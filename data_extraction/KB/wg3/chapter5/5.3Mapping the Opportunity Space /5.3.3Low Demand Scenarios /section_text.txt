Long-term mitigation scenarios play a crucial role in climate policy design in the near term, by illuminating transition pathways, interactions between supply-side and demand-side interventions, their timing, and the scales of required investments needed to achieve mitigation goals (Chapter 3). Historically, most long-term mitigation scenarios have taken technology-centric approaches with heavy reliance on supply-side solutions and the use of carbon dioxide removal, particularly in 1.5°C scenarios (Rogelj et al. 2018). Comparatively less attention has been paid to deep demand-side reductions incorporating socio-cultural change and the cascade effects (Section 5.3.2) associated with ASI strategies, primarily due to limited past representation of such service-oriented interventions in long-term integrated assessment models (IAMs) and energy systems models (ESMs) (Grubler et al. 2018; van de Ven et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019). There is ample evidence of savings from sector- or issue-specific bottom-up studies (Section 5.3.1.2). However, these savings typically get lost in the dominant narrative provided by IAMs and ESMs and in their aggregate-level evaluations of combinations of ASI and efficiency strategies. As a result, their interaction effects do not typically get equal focus alongside supply-side and carbon dioxide removal options (Samadi et al. 2017; Van Vuuren et al. 2018; Van den Berg et al. 2019).In response to 1.5°C ambitions, and a growing desire to identify participatory pathways with less reliance on carbon dioxide removal which has high uncertainty, some recent IAM and ESM mitigation scenarios have explored the role of deep demand-side energy and resource use reduction potentials at global and regional levels. Table 5.2 summarises long-term scenarios that aimed to: minimise service-level energy and resource demand as a central mitigation tenet; specifically evaluate the role of behavioural change and ASI strategies; and/or achieve a carbon budget with limited or no carbon dioxide removal. From assessment of this emerging body of literature, several general observations arise and are presented below.First, socio-cultural changes within transition pathways can offer gigatonne-scale CO2 savings potential at the global level, and therefore represent a substantial overlooked strategy in traditional mitigation scenarios. Two lifestyle change scenarios conducted with the IMAGE IAM suggested that behaviour and cultural changes such as heating and cooling set-point adjustments, shorter showers, reduced appliance use, shifts to public transit, less meat-intensive diets, and improved recycling can deliver an additional 1.7 Gt and 3 GtCO2 savings in 2050, beyond the savings achieved in traditional technology-centric mitigation scenarios for the 2°C and 1.5°C ambitions, respectively (van Sluisveld et al. 2016; Van Vuuren et al. 2018). In its Sustainable Development Scenario, the IEA’s behavioural change and resource efficiency wedges deliver around 3 GtCO2-eq reduction in 2050, combined savings, roughly equivalent to those of solar PV that same year (IEA 2019a). In Europe, a Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) scenario evaluating combined lifestyle changes such as teleworking, travel avoidance, dietary shifts, food waste reductions, and recycling reduced cumulative EU 27 CO2 emissions 2011–2050 by up to 16% compared to an SSP2 baseline (van de Ven et al. 2018). Also in Europe, a multi-regional input-output analysis suggested that adoption of low-carbon consumption practices could reduce carbon footprints by 25%, or 1.4 Gt (Moran et al. 2020). A global transport scenario suggests that transport sector emissions can decline from business-as-usual 18 GtCO2-eq to 2 GtCO2-eq if ASI strategies are deployed (Gota et al. 2019), a value considerably below the estimates provided in IAM scenarios that have limited or no resolution in ASI strategies (Chapter 10).The IEA’s Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario, in which behavioural changes lead to 1.7 GtCO2 savings in 2030, expresses the substantial mitigation opportunity in terms of low-carbon technology equivalencies: to achieve the same emissions reductions, the global share of EVs in the NZE would have to increase from 20% to 45% by 2030 or the number of installed heat pumps in homes would have to increase from 440 to 660 million by 2030 (IEA 2021).In light of the limited number of mitigation scenarios that represent socio-behavioural changes explicitly, there is medium evidence in the literature that such changes can reduce emissions at regional and global levels, but  high agreement  within that literature that such changes hold up to gigatonne-scale CO2 emissions reduction potentials.Second, pursuant to the ASI principle, deep demand reductions require parallel pursuit of behavioural change and advanced energy-efficient technology deployment; neither is sufficient on its own. The LED scenario (Figure 5.10) combines behavioural and technological change consistent with numerous ASI strategies that leverage digitalisation, sharing, and circular economy megatrends to deliver decent living standards while reducing global final energy demand in 2050 to 245 EJ (Grubler et al. 2018). This value is 40% lower than final energy demand in 2018 (IEA 2019a), and a lower 2050 outcome than other IAM/ESM scenarios with primarily technology-centric mitigation approaches (Teske et al. 2015; IEA 2017b). In the IEA’s B2DS scenario, Avoid/Shift in the transport sector accounts for around 2 GtCO2-eq yr –1 in 2060, whereas parallel vehicle efficiency improvements increase the overall mitigation wedge to 5.5 GtCO2-eq yr –1 in 2060 (IEA 2017b). Through a combination of behavioural change and energy-efficient technology adoption, the IEA’s NZE requires only 340 EJ of global final energy demand with universal energy access in 2050, which is among the lowest of IPCC net zero SR1.5 scenarios (IEA 2021).Third, low demand scenarios can reduce both supply-side capacity additions and the need for carbon capture and removal technologies to reach emissions targets. Of the scenarios listed in Table 5.2, one (LED-MESSAGE) reaches 2050 emissions targets with no carbon capture or removal technologies (Grubler et al. 2018), whereas others report significant reductions in reliance on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) compared to traditional technology-centric mitigation pathways (Liu et al. 2018; Van Vuuren et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019), with the IEA’s NZE notably requiring the least carbon dioxide removal (1.8 Gt in 2050) and primary bioenergy (100 EJ in 2050) compared to IPCC net zero SR1.5 scenarios (IEA 2021).Fourth, the costs of reaching mitigation targets may be lower when incorporating ASI strategies for deep energy and resource demand reductions. The TIAM-Grantham low demand scenarios displayed reduction in mitigation costs (0.87–2.4% of GDP), while achieving even lower cumulative emissions to 2100 (228 to ~475 GtCO2) than its central demand scenario (741 to 1066 GtCO2), which had a cost range of (2.4–4.1% of GDP) (Napp et al. 2019). The GCAM behavioural change scenario concluded that domestic emission savings would contribute to reducing the costs of achieving the internationally agreed climate goal of the EU by 13.5% to 30% (van de Ven et al. 2018). The AIMS lifestyle case indicated that mitigation costs, expressed as global GDP loss, would be 14% lower than the SSP2 reference scenario in 2100, for both 2°C and 1.5°C mitigation targets (Liu et al. 2018). These findings mirror earlier AIM results, which indicated lower overall mitigation costs for scenarios focused on energy service demand reductions (Fujimori et al. 2014). In the IEA’s NZE, behavioural changes that avoid energy and resource demand save USD4 trillion (cumulatively 2021–2050) compared to if those emissions reductions were achieved through low‐carbon electricity and hydrogen deployment (IEA 2021).Based on the limited number of long-term mitigation scenarios that explicitly represent demand reductions enabled by ASI strategies, there is medium evidence but with  high agreement  within the literature that such scenarios can reduce dependence on supply-side capacity additions and carbon capture and removal technologies, with opportunites for lower overall mitigation costs.If the limitations within most IAMs and ESMs regarding non-inclusion of granular ASI strategy analysis can be addressed, it will expand and improve long-term mitigation scenarios (Van den Berg et al. 2019). These include broader inclusion of mitigation costs for behavioural interventions (van Sluisveld et al. 2016), much greater incorporation of rebound effects (Krey et al. 2019), including from improved efficiencies (Brockway et al. 2021) and avoided spending (van de Ven et al. 2018), improved representation of materials cycles to assess resource cascades (Pauliuk et al. 2017), broader coverage of behavioural change (Samadi et al. 2017; Saujot et al. 2020), improved consideration of how economic development affects service demand (Semieniuk et al. 2021), explicit representation of intersectoral linkages related to digitalisation, sharing economy, and circular economy strategies (Section 5.3.4), and institutional, political, social, entrepreneurial, and cultural factors (van Sluisveld et al. 2018). Addressing the current significant modelling limitations will require increased investments in data generation and collection, model development, and inter-model comparisons, with a particular focus on socio-behavioural research, which has been underrepresented in mitigation research funding to date (Overland and Sovacool 2020).COVID-19 interacts with demand-side scenarios (Box 5.2). Energy demand will mostly likely be reduced between 2020 and 2030 compared to the default pathway, and if recovery is steered towards low energy demand, carbon prices for a 1.5°C-consistent pathway will be reduced by 19%, energy supply investments until 2030 will be reduced by USD1.8 trillion, and the pressure to rapidly upscale renewable energy technologies will be softened (Kikstra et al. 2021a).Table 5.2 | Summary of long-term scenarios with elements that aimed to minimise service-level energy and resource demand.
