There is very  high evidence and very high agreement  that globally, there are differences in the amount of energy that societies require to provide the basic needs for everyone. At present nearly one-third of the world’s population are ‘energy poor’, facing challenges in both access and affordability, that is, more than 2.6 billion people have little or no access to energy for clean cooking. About 1.2 billion lack energy for cleaning, sanitation and water supply, lighting, and basic livelihood tasks (Sovacool and Drupady 2016; Rao and Pachauri 2017).The current per capita energy requirement to provide a decent standard of living range from around 5 to 200 GJ cap –1 yr –1 (Steckel et al. 2013; Lamb and Steinberger 2017; Rao et al. 2019b; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020), which shows the level of inequality that exists; this depends on the context, such as geography, culture, infrastructure or how services are provided (Brand-Correa et al. 2018) (Box 5.3). However, through efficient technologies and radical demand-side transformations, the final energy requirements for providing DLS by 2050 is estimated at 15.3 GJ cap –1 yr –1 (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020). Recent DLS estimates for Brazil, South Africa, and India are in the range between 15 and 25 GJ cap –1 yr –1 (Rao et al. 2019b).The most gravely energy poor are often those living in informal settlements, particularly women, in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, whose socially-determined responsibilities for food, water, and care are highly labour-intensive and made more intense by climate change (Guruswamy 2016; Wester et al. 2019). In Brazil, India and South Africa, where inequality is extreme (Alvaredo et al. 2018) mobility (51–60%), food production and preparation (21–27%) and housing (5–12%) dominate total energy needs (Rao et al. 2019b). Minimum requirements of energy use consistent with enabling well-being for all is between 20 and 50 GJ cap –1 yr –1 depending on context (Rao et al. 2019b). Inequality in access to and availability of services for human well-being varies in extreme degree across countries and income groups. In developing countries, the bottom 50% receive about 10% of the energy used in land transport and less than 5% in air transport, while the top 10% use about 45% of the energy for land transport and around 75% for air transport (Oswald et al. 2020). Within-country analysis shows that particular groups in China – women born in the rural West with disadvantaged family backgrounds – face unequal opportunities for energy consumption (Shi 2019). Figure 5.3 shows the wide variation across world regions in people’s access to some of the basic material prerequisites for meeting DLS, and variations in energy consumption, providing a starting point for comparative global analysis.Figure 5.3 | Energy use per capita per year of three groups of countries ranked by socio-economic development and displayed for each country based on four or five different income groups (according to data availability) as well as geographical representation. The final energy use for decent living standards (20–50 GJ cap –1 yr –1) (Rao et al. 2019b) is indicated in the blue column as a reference for global range, rather than dependent on each country.
