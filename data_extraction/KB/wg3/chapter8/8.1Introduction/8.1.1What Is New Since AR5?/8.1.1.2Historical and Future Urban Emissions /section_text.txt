One major innovation in this Assessment Report is the inclusion of historical and future urban GHG emissions. Urban emissions based on consumption-based accounting by regions has been put forth for the time frame 1990–2100 using multiple datasets with projections given in the framework of the Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP)–Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. This advance has provided a time dimension to urban footprints considering different climate scenarios with implications for urban mitigation, allowing a comparison of the way urban emissions and their reduction can evolve given different scenario contexts (see Glossary for definitions of various ‘pathways’ and ‘scenarios’ in the context of climate change mitigation, including ‘SSPs’ and ‘RCPs’).
