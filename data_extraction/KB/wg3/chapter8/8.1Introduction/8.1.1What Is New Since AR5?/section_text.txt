Special emphasis is placed on the co-benefits of urban mitigation options, including an evaluation of linkages with the SDGs based on synergies and/or trade-offs. Urban mitigation options are further evaluated based on multiple dimensions according to the feasibility assessment (see Section 8.5.5 and Figure 8.19, and Section 8.SM.2) indicating the enablers and barriers of implementation. These advances provide additional guidance for urban mitigation.
