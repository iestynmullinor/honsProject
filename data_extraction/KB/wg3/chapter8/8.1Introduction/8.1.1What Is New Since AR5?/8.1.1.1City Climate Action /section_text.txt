Moreover, cities around the world are putting increasing focus on tackling climate change. Since AR5:•Climate leadership at the local scale is growing with commitment from city decision-makers and policymakers to implement local-scale mitigation strategies (GCoM 2018, 2019; ICLEI 2019a; C40 Cities 2020 a).•More than 360 cities announced at the Paris Climate Conference that the collective impact of their commitments will lead to a reduction of up to 3.7 GtCO2-eq (CO2-equivalent) of urban emissions annually by 2030 (Cities for Climate 2015).•The Global Covenant of Mayors (GCoM), a transnational network of more than 10,000 cities, has made commitments to reduce urban GHG emissions by up to 1.4–2.3 GtCO2-eq annually by 2030 and 2.8–4.2 GtCO2-eq annually by 2050, compared to business-as-usual (GCoM 2018, 2019).•More than 800 cities have made commitments to achieve net-zero GHG emissions, either economy-wide or in a particular sector (NewClimate Institute and Data-Driven EnviroLab 2020).Although most cities and other subnational actors are yet to meet their net-zero GHG or CO2 emissions commitments, the growing numbers of those commitments, alongside organisations enabled to facilitate reaching those targets, underscore the growing support for climate action by city and other subnational leaders.
