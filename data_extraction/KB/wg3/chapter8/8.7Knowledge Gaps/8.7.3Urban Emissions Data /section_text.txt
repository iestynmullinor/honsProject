Though there has been a rapid rise in quantification and analysis of urban emissions, gaps remain in comprehensive global coverage, particularly in the Global South, and reliance on standardised frameworks and systematic data are lacking (Gurney and Shepson 2021; Mueller et al. 2021). The development of protocols by (BSI 2013; Fong et al. 2014; ICLEI 2019b) that urban areas can use to organise emissions accounts has been an important step forward, but no single agreed-upon reporting framework exists (Lombardi et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019b; Ramaswami et al. 2021). Additionally, there is no standardisation of emissions data and limited independent validation procedures (Gurney and Shepson 2021). This is partly driven by the recognition that urban emissions can be conceptualised using different frameworks, each of which has a different meaning for different urban communities (Section 8.1.6.2). Equally important is the recognition that acquisition and analysis of complex data used to populate urban GHG inventory protocols remains a barrier for local practitioners (Creutzig et al. 2019). The limited standardisation has also led to incomparability of the many individual or city cluster analyses that have been accomplished since AR5. Finally, comprehensive, global quantification of urban emissions remains incomplete in spite of recent efforts (Moran et al. 2018; Zheng et al. 2018; Harris et al. 2020; Jiang et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2021; Wiedmann et al. 2021).Similarly, independent verification or evaluation of urban GHG emissions has seen a large number of research studies (e.g., Wu et al. 2016; Sargent et al. 2018; Whetstone 2018; Lauvaux et al. 2020). This has been driven by the recognition that self-reported approaches may not provide adequate accuracy to track emissions changes and provide confidence for mitigation investment (Gurney and Shepson 2021).The most promising approach to independent verification of urban emissions has been the use of urban atmospheric monitoring (direct flux and/or concentration) as a means to assess and track urban GHG emissions (Davis et al. 2017). However, like the basic accounting approach itself, standardisation and practical deployment and scaling is an essential near-term need.
