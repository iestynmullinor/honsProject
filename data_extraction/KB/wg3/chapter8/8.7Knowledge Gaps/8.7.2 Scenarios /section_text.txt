The urban share of global emissions is significant and is expected to increase in the coming decades. This places emphasis on the need to expand development of urban emissions scenarios within climate mitigation scenarios (Gurney et al. 2021, 2022). The literature on globally comprehensive analysis of urban emissions within the existing IPCC scenario framework remains very limited, curtailing understanding of urban emissions tipping points, mitigation opportunities and overall climate policy complexity. A review of the applications of the SSP-RCP scenario framework also recommended downscaling global SSPs to improve the applicability of this framework to regional and local scales (Oâ€™Neill et al. 2020). This remains an urgent need and will require multidisciplinary research efforts, particularly as net-zero-emissions targets are emphasised.
