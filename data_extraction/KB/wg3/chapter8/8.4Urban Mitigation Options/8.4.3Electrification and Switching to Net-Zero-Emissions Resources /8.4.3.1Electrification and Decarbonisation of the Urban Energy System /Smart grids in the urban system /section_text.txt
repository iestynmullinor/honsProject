Smart electricity grids enable peak demand reductions, energy conservation, and renewable energy penetration, and are a subset of smart energy systems. GHG emission reductions from smart grids range from 10 to 180 gCO2 kWh –1 (grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour) with a median value of 89 gCO2 kWh –1, depending on the electricity mix, penetration of renewable energy, and the system boundary (Moretti et al. 2017). Smart electricity grids are characterised by bi-directional flows of electricity and information between generators and consumers, although some actors can be both as ‘prosumer’ (see Glossary). Two-way power flows can be used to establish peer-to-peer trading (P2P) (Hansen et al. 2020). Business models based on local citizen utilities (Green and Newman 2017 ; Green et al. 2020; Syed et al. 2020) and community batteries (Mey and Hicks 2019; Green et al. 2020) can support the realisation of distributed energy and solar energy cities (Galloway and Newman 2014; Byrne and Taminiau 2016; Stewart et al. 2018; Allan 2020).Currently, despite power outages that are costly to local economies, the adoption of smart electricity grids or smart energy systems has been slow in many developing regions, including in Sub-Saharan Africa (Westphal et al. 2017; Kennedy et al. 2019). This is due to a number of different factors, such as unreliable existing infrastructure, fractured fiscal authority, lack of electricity access in urban areas, upfront cost, financial barriers, inefficient pricing of electricity, and low consumer education and engagement (Venkatachary et al. 2018; Acakpovi et al. 2019; Cirolia 2020).
