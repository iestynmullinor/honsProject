Care is required to clarify what is optimised (Dietz and Venmans 2019). Optimising a path towards a given temperature goal by a fixed date (e.g., 2100) gives time-inconsistent results backloaded to large, last-minute investment in carbon dioxide removal (CDR). ‘Cost-effective’ optimisations generate less initial effort than equivalent  cost-benefit models (Dietz and Venmans 2019; Gollier 2021) as they do not incorporate benefits of reducing impacts earlier.‘Efficient pathways’ are affected by inertia and innovation. Inertia implies amplifying action on long-lived investments and infrastructure that could otherwise lock-in emissions for many decades (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2018; Baldwin et al. 2020). Chapter 3 (Section 3.5) discusses interactions between near-, medium- and long-term actions in global pathways, particularly vis-à-vis  inertia. Also, to the extent that early action induces low-carbon innovation, it ‘multiplies’ the optimal effort (for given damage assumptions), because it facilitates subsequent cheaper abatement. For example, a ‘learning-by-doing’ analysis concludes that early deployment of expensive PV was of net global economic benefit, due to induced innovation (Newbery 2018).Research thus increasingly emphasises the need to understand climate transformation in terms of dynamic, rather than static, efficiency (Gillingham and Stock 2018). This means taking account of inertia, learning and various additional sources of ‘path-dependence’. Including induced innovation in stylised IAMs can radically change the outlook (Acemoglu et al. 2012, 2016), albeit with limitations (Pottier et al. 2014); many more detailed-process IAMs now do include endogenous technical change (as reviewed in Yang et al. 2018 and Grubb et al. 2021b) (Annex III).These dynamic and uncertainty effects typically justify greater upfront effort (Kalkuhl et al. 2012; Bertram et al. 2015), including accelerated international diffusion (Schultes et al. 2018), and strengthen optimal initial effort in cost-benefit models (Baldwin et al. 2020; Grubb et al. 2021b). Approaches to risk premia common in finance would similarly amplify the initial mitigation effort, declining as uncertainties reduce (Daniel et al. 2019).
