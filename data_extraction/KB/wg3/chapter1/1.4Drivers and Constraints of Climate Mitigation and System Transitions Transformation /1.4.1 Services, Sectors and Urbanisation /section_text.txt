Human activities drive emissions primarily through the demand for a wide range of services such as food, shelter, heating/cooling, goods, travel, communication, and entertainment. This demand is fulfilled by various activities often grouped into sectors such as agriculture, industry and commerce. The literature uses a wide range of sectoral definitions to organise data and analysis (Chapter 2). Energy sectors are typically organised into primary energy producers, energy transformation processes (such as power generation and fuel refining), and major energy users such as buildings, industry and transport (Chapters 2 and 5). Other research (Chapter 8) organises data around interacting urban and rural human activities. Land-based activities can be organised into agriculture, forestry and other land-use (AFOLU), or land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) (Chapter 7). Each set of sectoral definitions and analysis offers its own insights.Sectoral perspectives help to identify and understand the drivers of emissions, opportunities for emissions mitigation, and interactions with resources, other goals and other sectors, including the co-evolution of systems across scales (Kyle et al. 2016; Moss et al. 2016; Mori et al. 2017; IPBES 2019). Interactions between sectors and agents pursuing multiple goals is a major theme pervading this assessment.The ‘nexus’ between energy, water, and land – all key contributors to human well-being – also helps to provide, regulate and support ecosystem and cultural services (Bazilian et al. 2011; Ringler et al. 2013; Smajgl et al. 2016; Albrecht et al. 2018; Brouwer et al. 2018; D’Odorico et al. 2018; Van Vuuren et al. 2019), with important implications for cities in managing new systems of transformation (Thornbush et al. 2013; Wolfram et al. 2016) (Chapter 8). Other important nexuses shaping our planet’s future (Fajardy et al. 2018) include agriculture, forestry, land use and ecosystem services (Chazdon 2008; Settele et al. 2016; Torralba et al. 2016; Nesshöver et al. 2017; Keesstra et al. 2018).Historically, energy-related GHG emissions were considered a by-product of the increasing scale of human activity, driven by population size, economic activity and technology. That simple notion has evolved greatly over time to become much more complex and diverse, with increasing focus on the provision of energy services (Cullen and Allwood 2010; Bardi et al. 2019; Brockway et al. 2019; Garrett et al. 2020). The demand for agricultural products has historically driven conversion of natural lands (land-use change). AFOLU along with food processing accounts for 21–37% of total net anthropogenic GHG emissions (SRCCL SPM A3). 5 Continued growth in population and income are expected to continue driving up demand for goods and services (Chapters 2, 3 and 5), with an important role for urbanisation which is proceeding at an unprecedented speed and scale. In the last decade, the urban population grew by 70 million people each year, or about 1.3 million people per week, with urban area expanding by about 102 km 2 per day (Chapter 8). Urban areas account for most (45–87%) of the global carbon footprint (8.1) and the strong and positive correlation between urbanisation and incomes means higher consumption from urban lifestyles will continue driving direct and indirect GHG emissions. Cities provide a conduit to many of the services such as transportation, housing, water, food, medical care and recreation, and other services and urban carbon emissions are driven not only by population and income but also by the form and structure of urban areas (Sections 8.1 and 8.3–8.6). This creates opportunities for decarbonisation through urban planning and purposeful ‘experimentation’ (Newman et al. 2017) (Chapter 8).Human needs and wants evolve over time making the transition toward climate and sustainable development goals either more or less difficult. For example, changes in the composition of goods consumed, such as shifting diets toward a more vegetarian balance, can reduce land-use emissions without compromising the quality of life (Stehfest et al. 2009; Gough 2017; van Vuuren et al. 2018; van den Berg et al. 2019; Hargreaves et al. 2021; SRCCL SPM B2.3).Human behaviour and choices, including joint achievement of wider social goals, will play an important part in enabling or hindering climate mitigation and sustainable development (Shi et al. 2016), for example, shifting passenger transportation preferences in ways that combine climate, health and sustainable development goals (Romanello et al. 2021).
