At one level, sustainable development can be seen as a meta framework for integrating climate action with other global sustainability goals (Casadio Tarabusi and Guarini 2013; Antal and Van Den Bergh 2016). Fundamentally, the concept of sustainable development underscores the interlinkages and interdependence of human and natural systems and the need to balance economic, social, and environmental (including climate pollution) aspects in development planning and processes (Nunan 2017; Gomez-Echeverri 2018b; Zhenmin and Espinosa 2019).Despite the appeal of the concept, tensions remain over the interpretation and practical application, with acute disagreements regarding what the balancing entails in real life, how to measure well-being, which goals to set, and the means through which such goals might be pursued (Arrow et al. 2011; Dasgupta et al. 2015; Michelsen et al. 2016; Okereke and Massaquoi 2017; UNEP 2018b; Haberl et al. 2019; Shang et al. 2019; Sugiawan et al. 2019).Moreover, countries differ enormously in their respective situation regarding their development path – a condition which affects their capability, goals, priorities and approach to the pursuit of sustainability (Shi et al. 2016; Ramos-Mejía et al. 2018; Okereke et al. 2019). Most of the literature recognises that despite its limitations, sustainable development with its emphasis on integrating social, economic and environmental goals, provides a more comprehensive approach to the pursuit of planetary health and human well-being. Sustainable development is then not a static objective but a dynamic framework for measuring human progress (Costanza et al. 2016; Fotis and Polemis 2018), relevant for all countries even if different groups of nations experience the challenge of sustainability in different ways.Much like sustainable development, concepts like low-carbon development (Mulugetta and Urban 2010; Yuan et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2017; Tian et al. 2019), climate-compatible development (CCD) (Mitchell and Maxwell 2010; Tompkins et al. 2013; Stringer et al. 2014; Bickersteth et al. 2017) and more recently climate-resilient development (CRD) (Fankhauser and McDermott 2016; Henly-Shepard et al. 2018; IPCC 2018b) have all emerged as ideas, tools and frameworks, intended to bring together the goals of climate mitigation and the SDGs, as well as development more broadly. Figure 1.5 suggests that the prospects for realising a climate-resilient and equitable world are enhanced by a process of transformation and development trajectories that seek to limit global warming while also achieving the SDGs. The SDGs represent medium-term goals, and long-term sustainability requires continued effort to keep the world along a climate-resilient development path. A key feature of development or transformation pathways that achieve a climate-resilient world is that they maximise the synergies and minimise the trade-offs between climate mitigation and other sustainable development goals (Klausbruckner et al. 2016; Thornton and Comberti 2017; Wüstemann et al. 2017; Dagnachew et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018; Mainali et al. 2018). Crucially, the nature of trade-offs and timing of related decisions will vary across countries depending on circumstances including the level of development, capability and access to resources (Cross-Chapter Box 5, Shifting Development Paths to Increase Sustainability, in Chapter 4).Figure 1.5 | A climate-resilient and equitable world requires limiting global warming while achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Source: IPCC (2018b).Open figure Other concepts such as ‘Doughnut Economics’ (Raworth 2018), ecological modernisation, and mainstreaming are also used to convey ideals of development pathways that take sustainability, climate mitigation, and environmental limits seriously (Dale et al. 2015a). Mainstreaming focuses on incorporating climate change into national development activities, such as the building of infrastructure (Wamsler and Pauleit 2016; Runhaar et al. 2018). The ‘green economy’ and green growth – growth without undermining ecological systems, partly by gaining economic value from cleaner technologies and systems and is inclusive and equitable in its outcomes – has gained popularity in both developed and developing countries as an approach for harnessing economic growth to address environmental issues (Bina 2013; Georgeson et al. 2017; Capasso et al. 2019; Song et al. 2020; Hao et al. 2021). However, critics argue that green economy ultimately emphasises economic growth to the detriment of other important aspects of human welfare such as social justice (Death 2014; Adelman 2015; Kamuti 2015), and challenge the central idea that it is possible to decouple economic activity and growth (measured as GDP increment) from increasing use of biophysical resources (raw materials, energy) (Jackson and Victor 2019; Parrique et al. 2019; Haberl et al. 2020; Hickel and Kallis 2020; Vadén et al. 2020).Literature on degrowth, post growth, and post development questions the sustainability and imperative of more growth especially in already industrialised countries and argues that prosperity and the ‘Good Life’ are not immutably tied to economic growth (Asara et al. 2015; Escobar 2015; Latouche 2018; Kallis 2019) (Section 5.2.1). The concept of Just Transition also stresses the need to integrate justice concerns so as to not impose hardship on already marginalised populations within and between countries (Evans and Phelan 2016; Goddard and Farrelly 2018; Heffron and McCauley 2018; Smith, Jackie and Patterson 2018; McCauley and Heffron 2018) (Section 1.7.2). The key insight is that pursuing climate goals in the context of sustainable development requires holistic thinking including on how to measure well-being, serious consideration of the notion of ecological limits, at least some level of decoupling and certainly choices and decision-making approaches that exploit and maximise the synergy and minimise the trade-off between climate mitigation and other sustainable development goals. It also requires consideration of equity and justice within and between countries. However, ideas of a synergistic relationship between development and climate mitigation can sometimes offer limited practical guidelines for reconciling the tensions that are often present in practical policymaking (Ferguson et al. 2014; Dale et al. 2015b; Kasztelan 2017; Kotzé 2018).
