When indirect emissions from electricity and heat production are included, industry becomes the single highest emitting sector of GHGs (20.0 GtCO2-eq in 2019) ( high confidence). Facilitated by globalisation, East Asia has been the main source and primary driver of global industry emissions growth since 2000 (robust evidence,  high agreement ) (Lamb et al. 2021). However, while East Asia has emitted 45% of the world’s industry GHG emissions in 2019, a remarkable decrease of 5.0% yr –1 in energy intensity and 1.6% in carbon intensity helped to stabilise direct industrial CO2 emissions in this region (–0.3% yr –1 between 2010 and 2019; Figure 2.18). Direct industry CO2 emissions have also declined in Latin America, Europe and Australia, Japan and New Zealand, and – to a smaller extent – in North America. In all other regions, they were growing – most rapidly in southern Asia (+4.3% annually for direct CO2 emissions since 2010) (Figure 2.18).Figure 2.18 | Trends and drivers of global industry sector emissions (see Figure 2.16 caption for details) with energy measured as total final energy consumption. Open figure The main global driver of industry emissions has been a massive rise in the demand for products that are indirectly used in production, such as cement, chemicals, steel, aluminium, wood, paper, plastics, lubricants, fertilisers, and so on. This demand was driven by economic growth, rising affluence, and consumption, as well as a rapid rise in urban populations and associated infrastructure development (robust evidence,  high agreement ) (Krausmann et al. 2018). There is strong evidence that the growing use of concrete, steel, and other construction materials is particularly tightly coupled to these drivers (Pauliuk et al. 2013; Cao et al. 2017; Krausmann et al. 2017; Plank et al. 2018; Haberl et al. 2020). Per capita stocks of cement and steel show a typical pattern of rapid take-off as countries urbanise and industrialise, before slowing down to low growth at high levels of GDP. Hence, in countries that have recently been industrialising and urbanising – that is Eastern, Southern and South-Eastern Asia – a particularly strong increase of emissions from these subsectors can be observed. Selected wealthy countries seem to stabilise at high per capita levels of stocks, although it is unclear if these stabilisations persist and if they result in significant absolute reductions of material use (Wiedenhofer et al. 2015; Cao et al. 2017; Krausmann et al. 2018). Opportunities for prolonging lifetimes and improving end of life recycling in order to achieve absolute reductions in extraction activities are as yet unexploited (Krausmann et al. 2017; Zink and Geyer, 2017).On the production side, improvements in the efficiency of material extraction, processing, and manufacturing have reduced industrial energy use per unit of output (J. Wang et al. 2019  ). These measures, alongside improved material substitution, lightweight designs, extended product and servicing lifetimes, improved service efficiency, and increased reuse and recycling will enable substantial emissions reductions in the future (Hertwich et al. 2019). In absence of these improvements in energy intensity, the growth of population and GDP per capita would have driven the industrial CO2 emissions to rise by more than 100% by 2017 compared with 1990, instead of 56% (Lamb et al. 2021b). Nonetheless, many studies point to deep regional differences in efficiency levels and large globally unexploited potentials to improve industrial energy efficiency by adopting best available technologies and practices for metal, cement, and chemical production (Gutowski et al. 2013; Schulze et al. 2016; Hernandez et al. 2018; Talaei et al. 2018).
