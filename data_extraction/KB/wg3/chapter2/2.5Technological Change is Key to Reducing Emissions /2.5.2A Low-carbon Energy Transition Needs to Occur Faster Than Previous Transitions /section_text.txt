Recent work has also reasserted previous claims that the speed of a low-carbon transition will follow historical patterns  (low confidence). Broad transitions involve technological complexity, time-consuming technological development, risk-averse adopters, high upfront costs, and low immediate individual adoption benefits, attributes that are not all present in the examples of rapid change described above (Grubler et al. 2016). Additional factors that slow transitions include: the need for the transition to occur globally, thus requiring nations with unequal economic resources and development circumstances to engage in near-universal participation; slow progress in recent decades; intermittence of renewables, and the time involved in building supporting infrastructure (Smil 2016); difficulty in decarbonising transportation and industry (Rissman et al. 2020); and material resource constraints (Davidsson et al. 2014).
