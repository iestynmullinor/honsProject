In 2019, 34% (20 GtCO2-eq) of the 59 GtCO2-eq GHG emissions came from the energy sector, 24% (14 GtCO2-eq) from industry, 22% (13 GtCO2-eq) from AFOLU, 15% (8.7 GtCO2-eq) from transport and 6% (3.3 GtCO2-eq) from buildings (Figure 2.12). The relative size of each sector depends on the exact definition of sector boundaries (de la Rue du Can et al. 2015; Lamb et al. 2021b). The largest individual subsector contributing to global GHG emissions in 2019 was electricity and heat generation at 14 GtCO2-eq. This subsector can be reallocated to consuming sectors as indirect (scope 2) emissions to emphasise the role of final energy demand and demand-side solutions in climate change mitigation (Creutzig et al. 2018) (Chapter 5). This increases the emission share of the industry sector to 34% and of the buildings sector to 16%.Figure 2.12 | Total anthropogenic direct and indirect GHG emissions for the year 2019 (in GtCO2-eq) by sector and subsector. Direct emissions estimates assign emissions to the sector in which they arise (scope 1 reporting). Indirect emissions – as used here – refer to the reallocation of emissions from electricity and heat to the sector of final use (scope 2 reporting). Note that cement refers to process emissions only, as a lack of data prevents the full reallocation of indirect emissions to this sector. More comprehensive conceptualisations of indirect emissions including all products and services (scope 3 reporting) are discussed in Section 2.3 of this chapter. Emissions are converted into CO2-equivalents based on global warming potentials with a 100-year time horizon (GWP100) from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report. Percentages may not add up to 100 across categories due to rounding at the second significant digit. Source:  based on Lamb et al. (2021b); data: Minx et al. (2021).Open figure Average annual GHG emissions growth has been fastest in the transport sector with about 1.8% for the most recent period 2010–2019, followed by direct emissions in the industry sector (1.4%) and the energy sector (1%) (Figure 2.13). This is different to growth patterns observed in the previous decade as reported in AR5 (IPCC 2014a; Blanco et al. 2014). Between 2000 and 2009 fastest GHG emissions growth was observed for industry with 3.4% followed by the energy sector with 2.3%. GHG emissions growth in the transport sector has been stable across both periods at about 1.8%, while direct building emissions growth averaged below 1% during 2010–2019. Ranking of high-emitting subsectors by direct emissions highlights the importance of CO2 emissions from LULUCF (6.6 GtCO2-eq; but with low confidence in magnitude and trend), road transport (6.1 GtCO2-eq), metals (3.1 GtCO2-eq), and other industry (4.4 GtCO2-eq). Overall, some of the fastest growing sources of subsector emissions from 2010 to 2019 have been international aviation (+3.4%), 10  domestic aviation (+3.3%), inland shipping (+2.9%), metals (+2.3%), international shipping (+1.7%), and road transport (+1.7%).Figure 2.13 | Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions by major economic sector and their underlying trends by region.
