Located downstream in global supply chains, developed countries (mostly in Western Europe and North America) tend to be net emission importers, that is, EEI are larger than EEE. For example, over 40% of national CO2 footprints in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain are from imports (Fan et al. 2017). Developing countries tend to be net emission exporters with higher PBEs than their CBEs (Peters et al. 2011a), especially for Asia and Pacific (as shown in Figure 2.15). That is to say, there is a net emission transfer and outsourcing of carbon-intensive production from developed to developing economies via global trade (Jiang et al. 2018 ), mainly caused by cheap labour costs (Tate and Bals 2017) and cheap raw materials (Mukherjee 2018). Increasing openness to trade (Fern√°ndez-Amador et al. 2016) and less stringent environmental legislation (acting as so-called pollution havens) are also possible reasons (Hoekstra et al. 2016; Malik and Lan 2016; Banerjee and Murshed 2020).Figure 2.15 | Total annual CO2 emissions for 116 countries by global region based on consumption- and production-based emissions. The shaded areas are the net CO2 trade balances (differences) between each of the regions. Yellow shading indicates that the region is a net importer of embodied CO2 emissions, leading to consumption-based emission estimates that are higher than traditional territorial emission estimates. Blue shading indicates the reverse. Production-based emissions are collected from EDGAR and consumption-based emissions from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Source: this figure is modified based on Hubacek et al. (2021).Open figure Net emissions transferred between developing and developed countries peaked at 7.3% of global CO2 emissions in 2006 and then subsequently declined (Wood et al. 2020a). The main reason for the decline was an improvement in the carbon intensity of traded products, rather than a decline in trade volume (Wood et al. 2020a). Despite continued improvements, developing economies tend to have higher emission intensity than developed economies due to less efficient technologies and a carbon-intensive fuel mix (Jiang and Guan 2017).
