In comparison to territorial emissions discussed in Section 2.2, Figure 2.14 shows the trends of global and regional CBEs from 1990 to 2018. This section uses the PBEs and CBEs data from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al. 2020), which are slightly different from the PBEs used in Section 2.2. The Global Carbon Budget only includes CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement production.Figure 2.14 | Consumption-based CO2 emissions trends for the period 1990–2018. The CBEs  of countries are collected from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Source: this figure is modified based on Hubacek et al. (2021).Open figure The two panels at left in Figure 2.14 show total and per capita CBEs for six regions. The three panels on the right show additional information for the 18 top-emitting countries with the highest CBEs in 2018. In Developed Countries, consumption-based CO2 emissions peaked at 15 GtCO2 in 2007 with a subsequent 16% decline until 2016 (to 12.7 GtCO2) and a slight rebound of 1.6% until 2018 (to 12.9 GtCO2). Asia and Pacific has been a major contributor to consumption-based CO2 emissions growth since 2000 and exceeded Developed Countries as the global largest emissions source in 2015. From 1990 to 2018, the average growth rate of Asia and Pacific was 4.8% per year, while in other regions emissions declined by –1.1%–4.3% per year on average. In 2018, 35% of global consumption-based CO2 emissions were from Developed Countries and 39% from Asia and Pacific, 5% from Latin American and Caribbean, 5% from Eastern Europe and West Central Asia, 5% from Middle East, and 3% from Africa (Hubacek et al. 2021). Global CBEs kept growing over the period with a short-lived decline in 2008 due to the global financial crisis. In 2020, lockdowns associated with COVID-19 significantly reduced global emissions (Section 2.2.2), including CBEs (Shan et al. 2021a).
