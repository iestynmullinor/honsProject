This section summarises knowledge gaps that require further research:•Literature on mitigation pathways at the national level remains skewed towards large emitters. Many low-income countries have very few or no studies at all (Lepault and Lecocq 2021) (Section 4.2) (Annex III). Development of new studies and inclusion of associated scenarios in updated mitigation national mitigation pathway database would enhance understanding of mitigation at national level.•Ex ante and ex post analysis of mitigation action and of mitigation plans by non-state actors, and their relationship with mitigation action and plans by governments is limited (Section 4.2.3).• System analysis solutions are only beginning to be recognised in current literature on deep mitigation pathways, and rarely included in existing national policies or strategies (Section 4.2.5).•While the technology elements of accelerated mitigation pathways at national level are generally well documented, studies of the economic and social implications of such pathways remain scarce (Section 4.2.6).•Literature on the implication of development choices for emissions and for capacity to mitigate is limited (Section 4.3.2). In particular, more contributions from the research community working on development issues would be very useful here.•Literature describing shifts in development pathways, and the conditions for such shifts (based on past experience or on models) remains scarce (Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.3 and 4.4.1). Studying shifts in development pathways requires new ways of thinking with interdisciplinary research and use of alternative frameworks and methods suited for understanding of change agents, determinants of change and adaptive management among other issues (Winkler 2018). Research is not only expected to produce knowledge and boost innovation, but also to help identify transformation pathways and to enlighten public debate and public decision-making on related political choices.•Other research gaps concern the open ocean and blue carbon. There is limited knowledge about quantification of the blue carbon stocks. Research is required into what happens if the sequestration capacity of the ocean and marine ecosystems is damaged by climate change to the tipping point until the sink becomes an emitter, and on how to manage blue carbon (Section 4.4.2).•Knowledge is limited on: (i) linking equity frameworks on mitigation with adaptation and most importantly with loss and damage, (ii) applying ethical parameters to enrich many of the existing quantitative frameworks, to assess fairness and ambition of NDCs; (iii) extending equity frameworks to quantify equitable international support, as the difference between equity-based national emissions scenarios and national domestic emissions scenarios (Sections 4.2.2.7 and 4.5).
