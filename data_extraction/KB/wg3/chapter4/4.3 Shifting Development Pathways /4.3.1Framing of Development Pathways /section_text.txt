Beyond removing structural obstacles to accelerated mitigation, broadening the approach to policies that facilitate shifts in development pathways also helps manage the potential trade-offs between mitigation and other development objectives discussed in Section 4.2.7.Systematic studies of the 17 SDGs have found the interactions among them to be manifold and complex (Nilsson et al. 2016; Pradhan et al. 2017; Weitz et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019). Addressing them calls for interventions affecting fundamental, interconnected, structural features of global society (International Panel on Social Progress 2018; TWI2050 – The World in 2050 2018), such as to our physical infrastructure (e.g., energy, water, industrial, urban infrastructure) (Waage et al. 2015; Adshead et al. 2019; Chester 2019; Mansell et al. 2019; Thacker et al. 2019; ), our societal institutions (e.g., educational, public health, economic, innovation, and political institutions) (Ostrom 2010; Kläy et al. 2015; Messner 2015; Sachs et al. 2019), and behavioural and cultural tendencies (e.g., consumption patterns, conventional biases, discriminatory interpersonal and intergroup dynamics, and inequitable power structures) (Esquivel 2016; Sachs et al. 2019). These observations imply that attempt to address each SDG in isolation, or as independent technical challenges, would be insufficient, as would incremental, marginal changes. In contrast, effectively addressing the SDGs is likely to mean significant disruption of long-standing trends and transformative progress to shift development pathways to meet al. the SDGs, including climate action, beyond incremental changes targeted at addressing mitigation objectives in isolation. In other words, mitigation conceived as incremental change is not enough. Transformational change has implications for equity in its multiple dimensions ( Steffen and Stafford Smith 2013; Klinsky et al. 2017a; Leach et al. 2018) including just transitions (Section 4.5).Working Group II examines climate resilient development pathways (CRDP) – continuous processes that imply deep societal changes and/or transformation, so as to strengthen sustainable development, efforts to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while promoting fair and cross-scalar capacities for adaptation to global warming and reduction of GHG emissions in the atmosphere. Transformative action in the context of CRDP specifically concerns leveraging change in the five dimensions of development (people, prosperity, partnership, peace, planet) (AR6 WGII, Chapter 18).Section 4.3.2 provides more details on the way development pathways influence emissions and mitigative capacity. Section 4.3.3 provides examples of shifts in development pathways, as well as of policies that might facilitate those. Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter details the links between SDPS and sustainability.
