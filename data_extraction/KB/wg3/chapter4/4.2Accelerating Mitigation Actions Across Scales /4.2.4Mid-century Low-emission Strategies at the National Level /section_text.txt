An increasing amount of literature describes mitigation pathways for the mid-term (up to 2050). We assess literature reflecting on the UNFCCC process (Section 4.2.4.1), other official plans and strategies (Section 4.2.4.2) and academic literature on mid-century low-emission pathways at the national level (Section 4.2.4.3). After the Paris Agreement and the IPCC SR1.5 Report, the number of academic papers analysing domestic emission pathways compatible with the 1.5Â°C limit has been increasing. Governments have developed an increasing number of mitigation strategies up to 2050. Several among these strategies aim at net zero CO2 or net zero GHG, but it is not yet possible to draw global implications due to the limited size of sample (limited evidence, limited agreement).
