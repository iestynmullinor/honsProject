Sectoral studies are essential to understand the contributions of concrete measures of NDCs and current policies. For example, approximately 98% of NDCs include the energy sector in their mitigation contributions, of which nearly 50% include a specific target for the share of renewables, and about 5% aim at increasing nuclear energy production (Stephan et al. 2016). Transport is covered explicitly in 75% of NDCs, although specific targets for the sector exist in only 21% of NDCs (PPMC and SLoCaT 2016). Measures or targets for buildings are referred to explicitly in 27% of NDCs (GIZ 2017). Additionally, 36% of NDCs include targets or actions that are specific to the agriculture sector (FAO 2016). LULUCF (mitigation) is included in 80% of all submitted NDCs, while 59% include adaptation and 29% refer to REDD+.Greater sectoral expertise and involvement will be critical to accomplishing development and climate goals due to enhanced availability of information and expertise on specific sectoral options, greater ease of aligning the NDCs with sectoral strategies, and greater awareness among sector-level decision-makers and stakeholders (Fekete et al. 2015; NDC Partnership 2017). Sector-specific studies are assessed in the sectoral Chapters (6 to 11) of this report.
