A large body of literature on national and regional emissions projections, including official communications of as part of the NDC submissions and independent studies exist. A subset of this literature provides quantitative estimates for the 2030 timeframe. As highlighted in Section 4.2.1, the number of independent studies varies considerably across countries with an emphasis on the largest emitting countries. This is reflected in Table 4.1 (see also Table 4.SM.1). Despite smaller differences between globally comprehensive and national studies for a few countries, there is generally good agreement between the different types of studies, providing evidence that these quantitative estimates are fairly robust.
