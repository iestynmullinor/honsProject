Under the Enhanced Transparency Framework, countries will transition from reporting biennial reports (BRs) and biennial update reports (BURs) to reporting biennial transparency reports (BTRs) starting, at the latest, by December 2024. Each Party will be required to report information necessary to track progress made in implementing and achieving its NDC under the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2018b). Thus, no official data exists yet on tracking progress of individual NDCs.Meanwhile, there is some literature at global and national level that aims at assessing whether countries are on track or progressing towards implementing their NDCs and to which degree the NDCs collectively are sufficient to reach the temperature targets of the Paris agreement (Rogelj et al. 2016; Quéré et al. 2018; Höhne et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020; den Elzen et al. 2019; Höhne et al. 2020). Most of these studies focus on major emitters such as G20 countries and with the aim to inform countries to strengthen their ambition regularly, for example, through progress of NDCs and as part of the global stocktake (Höhne et al. 2018; Peters et al. 2017). However, a limited number of studies assess the implementation gaps of conditional NDCs in terms of finance, technology and capacity building support. Some authors conclude that finance needed to fulfil conditional NDCs exceeds available resources or the current long-term goal for finance (USD100 billion yr –1) (Pauw et al. 2019); others assess financial resources needed for forest-related activities (Kissinger et al. 2019) (Section 15.4.2). The literature suggests that consistent and harmonised approach to track progress of countries towards their NDCs would be helpful (Peters et al. 2017; Höhne et al. 2018; den Elzen et al. 2019), and negotiations on a common tabular format are expected to conclude during COP26 in November 2021.With an implementation gap in 2030 of 4 to 7 GtCO2-eq (Section 4.2.2.5), many countries will need to implement additional policies to meet their self-determined mitigation targets as specified under the NDCs. Studies that assess the level of projected emissions under current policies indicate that new policies (that have been implemented since the first assessment of the NDCs in 2015 and are thus covered in more recent projections) have reduced projections, by about two GtCO2-eq since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 to 2019 (Climate Action Tracker 2019; UNEP 2020a; den Elzen et al. 2019).
