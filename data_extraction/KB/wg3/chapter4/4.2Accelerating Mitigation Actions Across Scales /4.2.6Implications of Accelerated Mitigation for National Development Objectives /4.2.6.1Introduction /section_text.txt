This section examines how accelerated mitigation may impact the realisation of development objectives in the near- and mid-term. It focuses on three objectives discussed in the literature, sustaining economic growth (Section 4.2.6.2), providing employment (Section 4.2.6.3), and alleviating poverty and ensuring equity (Section 4.2.6.4). It complements similar review performed at global level in Section 3.6. For a comprehensive survey of research on the impact of mitigation in other areas (including air quality, health, and biodiversity), see Karlsson et al. (2020).
