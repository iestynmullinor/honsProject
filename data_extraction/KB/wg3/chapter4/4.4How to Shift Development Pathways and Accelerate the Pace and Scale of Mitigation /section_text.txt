As noted above, shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation involve a broad range of stakeholders and decision-makers, at multiple geographical and temporal scales. They require a credible and trusted process for reconciling perspectives and balancing potential side-effects, managing winners and losers and implementing compensatory measures to ensure an inclusive just transition (Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Miller and Richter 2014; Gambhir et al. 2018; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019). Such processes are designed to manage the risk of inequitable or non-representative power dynamics (Helsinki Design Lab 2011; Boulle et al. 2015; Kahane 2012). More generally, stakeholder processes can be subject to regulatory capture by special interests, or outright opposition from a variety of stakeholders. Information asymmetry between government and business may shape the results of consultative processes. Long experience of political management of change demonstrates that managing such risks is not easy, and requires sufficiently strong and competent institutions (Stiglitz 1998). The next section on Just Transition (Section 4.5) addresses this issue.
