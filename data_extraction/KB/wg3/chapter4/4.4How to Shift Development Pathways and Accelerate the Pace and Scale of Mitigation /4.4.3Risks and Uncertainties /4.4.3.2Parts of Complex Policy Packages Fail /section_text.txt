As outlined in the examples in Section 4.4.1 above, shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation are complex endeavours, on which there is limited experience and know-how from the past. An uncertainty is that parts of these policy packages may fail, in other words, under-deliver relative to the amount of mitigation and of transformations initially expected. For example, France has failed to meet its 2015â€“2018 carbon budget as housing retrofitting programs, in particular, have failed to deliver the expected amount of emission reductions (Haut Conseil pour le Climat 2019). There are two main options to tackle this risk. The first is to build in redundancy. The second is to anticipate that some parts of the policies will inevitably fail, and build-in monitoring and corrective mechanisms in a sequential decision-making process. To this regard, building institutions that can properly monitor, learn from and improve over time is critical (Nair and Howlett 2017).
