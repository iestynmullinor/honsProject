As the current COVID-19 crisis demonstrates, events happen that can derail the best-laid plans. Unexpected events beyond the range of human experience until then are called ‘black swans’, given the expectation that all swans are white. The only point to note here is that such events may also provide opportunities. In the COVID-19 case, for example, the experience of conducting many activities on-line, which reduces emissions from transport, may leave an imprint on how some of these activities are carried out in the post-COVID-19 world. Similarly, reduced air pollution seen during the pandemics may increase support for mitigation and strengthen the case for climate action. However, the emissions implications of recovery packages depend on choosing policies that support climate action while addressing the socio-economic implications of COVID-19 (Hepburn et al. 2020). Governments may be in a stronger position to do so due to their pivotal role in assuring the survival of many businesses during the pandemics. Given the magnitude of recovery packages and their implications (Pollitt et al. 2021), choosing the direction of recovery packages amounts to choosing a development pathway (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1).
