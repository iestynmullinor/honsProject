Finance and investment of mitigation actions must be examined in conjunction with funding of adaptation actions, due to biophysical linkages and policy trade-offs (Box 15.1). Most climate funding supports mitigation efforts, not adaptation efforts (Buchner et al. 2019) (Halimanjaya and Papyrakis 2012). Mitigation projects are often more attractive to private capital (Abadie et al. 2013; Buchner et al. 2019). Efforts to integrate adaptation and mitigation in climate change finance are limited (Kongsager et al. 2016; Locatelli et al. 2016) There is a perception that integration of mitigation and adaptation projects would lead to competition for limited finance available for adaptation (Locatelli et al. 2016). Long-standing debates (Ayers and Huq 2009; Smith et al. 2011) whether development finance counts as adaptation funding remain unresolved. See Chapter 15 for more in-depth discussion relating investment in funding mitigation and adaptation actions.
