Governance and institutional capacity necessary for mitigation actions also enables effective adaptation actions. Implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions can, however, encounter different sets of challenges. Mitigation actions requiring a shift away from established sectors and resources (e.g., fossil fuels) entail governance challenges to overcome vested interests (Piggot et al. 2020; SEI et al. 2020). Mitigation-focused initiatives from non-state actors tend to attain greater completion than adaptation-focused initiatives (NewClimate Institute et al. 2019).
