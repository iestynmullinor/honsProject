Adaptation-focused pathways might reduce inequality, if adequate support is available and well-distributed (Pelling and Garschagen 2019). Some studies suggest that cities might plan for possible synergies in adaptation and mitigation strategies, currently done independently (Grafakos et al. 2019). The literature suggests that cities might identify both mitigation and adaptation as co-benefits of interventions targeted at developmental goals (Dulal 2017).
