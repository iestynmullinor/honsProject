The scope of this chapter was motivated by the need for a succinct bottom-up cross-sectoral view of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation coupled with the desire to provide systemic perspectives on critical mitigation potentials and options that go beyond individual sectors and cover cross-sectoral topics such as food systems, land systems, and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods. Driven by this motivation, Chapter 12 provides a focused thematic assessment of CDR methods and food systems, followed by consideration of land-related impacts of mitigation options (land-based CDR and other mitigation options that occupy land) and other cross-sectoral impacts of mitigation, with emphasis on synergies and trade-offs between mitigation options, and between mitigation and other environmental and socio-economic objectives. The systems focus is unique to the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the IPCC and is of critical policy relevance as it informs coordinated approaches to planning interventions that deliver multiple benefits and minimise trade-offs, and coordinated policy approaches to support such planning, to tap relatively under-explored areas for the strengthening and acceleration of mitigation efforts in the short to medium term, and for dealing with residual emissions in hard-to-transition sectors in the medium to long term.Table 12.1 presents an overview of the cross-sectoral perspectives addressed in Chapter 12, mapping the chapter’s main themes to the sectoral and global chapters in this report. These mappings reflect the cross-sectoral aspects of mitigation options in the context of sustainable development, sectoral policy interactions, governance, implications in terms of international trade, spillover effects, and competitiveness, and cross-sectoral financing options for mitigation. While some cross-sector technologies are covered in more detail in sectoral chapters, this chapter covers important cross-sectoral linkages and provides synthesis concerning costs and potentials of mitigation options, and co-benefits and trade-offs that can be associated with deployment of mitigation options. Additionally, Chapter 12 covers CDR methods and specific considerations related to land use and food systems, complementing Chapter 7. The literature assessed in the chapter includes both peer-reviewed and grey literature since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC, including the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5), the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) and the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC). Knowledge gaps are identified and reflected where encountered, as well as in a separate section. Finally, a strong link is maintained with sectoral chapters and the relevant global chapters of this report to ensure consistency.Table 12.1 | An overview of cross-sector perspectives addressed in Chapter 12.
