New calculations using the EDGAR v6.0 (Crippa et al. 2021a) and FAOSTAT (FAO 2021) databases provide territorial-based food system GHG emissions by country globally for the period 1990 to 2018 (Crippa et al. 2021b). The data are calculated based on a combination of country-specific data and aggregated information as described byCrippa et al. (2021b) and Tubiello et al. (2021). The data show that, in 2018, 17 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (95% confidence range 13–23GtCO2-eq yr –1, calculated according to Solazzo et al. (2020)) were associated with the production, processing, distribution, consumption of food and management of food system residues. This corresponded to 31% (range 23–42%) of total anthropogenic GHG emissions of 54 GtCO2-eq yr –1. Based on the IPCC sectoral classification (Table 12.7 and Figure 12.5), the largest contribution of food systems GHG emissions in 2018 was from agriculture, that is, livestock and crop production systems (6.3 GtCO2-eq yr –1, range 2.6–11.9) and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) (4.0 GtCO2-eq yr –1, range 2.1–5.9) (Figure 12.5). Emissions from energy use were 3.9 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (3.6–4.4)  , waste management 1.7 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (0.9–2.6), and industrial processes and product use 0.9 GtCO2-eq yr –1 (0.6–1.1). The share of GHG emissions from food systems generated outside the AFOLU (agriculture and LULUCF) sectors has increased over recent decades, from 28% in 1990 to 39% in 2018.Table 12.7| GHG emissions from food systems by sector according to IPCC classification in Mt gas yr–1and food systems’ share of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in1990 and 2015.

LULUCF: land use, land-use change and forestry.Figure 12.5 | Food system GHG emissions from the agriculture, LULUCF, waste, and energy & industry sectors.  Source: Crippa et al. (2021b).Open figure Energy: Emissions from energy use occur throughout the food supply chain. In 2018, the main contributions came from energy industries supplying electricity and heat (970 MtCO2-eq yr –1), manufacturing and construction (920 MtCO2-eq yr –1, of which 29% was attributable to the food, beverage, and tobacco industry), and transport (760 MtCO2-eq yr –1). These emissions were almost entirely as CO2. Energy emissions from forestry and fisheries amounted to 480 MtCO2-eq yr –1, with 91% of emissions as CO2. Emissions from residential and commercial fuel combustion contributed 250 MtCO2-eq yr –1 (79% of emissions as CO2, and with emissions of 1.7 MtCH4 yr –1) and 130 MtCO2-eq yr –1 (with 98% of emissions as CO2), respectively.Refrigeration uses an estimated 43% of energy in the retail sector (Behfar et al. 2018) and significantly increases fuel consumption during distribution. Besides being energy intensive, supermarket refrigeration also contributes to GHG emissions through leakage of refrigerants (fluorinated gases, or F-gases), although their contribution to food system GHG emissions is estimated to be minor (Crippa et al. 2021b). The cold chain accounts for approximately 1% of global GHG emissions, but as the volume of refrigerators per capita in developing countries is reported to be one order of magnitude lower than in developed countries (19 m 3 versus 200 m 3 refrigerated storage capacity per 1000 inhabitants), the importance of refrigeration to total GHG emissions is expected to increase (James and James 2010). Although refrigeration gives rise to GHG emissions, both household refrigeration and effective cold chains could contribute to a substantial reduction in losses of perishable food and thus in emissions associated with food provision (University of Birmingham 2018; James and James 2010). A trade-off exists between reducing food waste and increased refrigeration emissions, with the benefits depending on type of produce, location and technologies used (Sustainable Cooling for All 2018; Wu et al. 2019).Transport has overall a minor importance for food system GHG emissions, with a share of 5% to 6% (Poore and Nemecek 2018; Crippa et al. 2021b). The largest contributor to food system transport GHG emissions was road transport (92%), followed by marine shipping (4%), rail (3%), and aviation (1%). Only looking at energy needs, air or road transport consumes one order of magnitude higher energy (road: 70–80 MJ t –1 km –1; aviation: 100–200 MJ t –1 km –1) than marine shipping (10–20 MJ t –1 km –1) or rail (8–10 MJ t –1 km –1) (FAO 2011). For specific food products with high water content, relatively low agricultural emissions and high average transport distances, the share of transport in total GHG emissions can be over 40% (e.g., bananas, with total global average GHG emissions of 0.7 kgCO2-eq kg –1) (Poore and Nemecek 2018), but transport is a minor source of GHG emissions for most food products (Poore and Nemecek 2018).Industry: Direct industrial emissions associated with food systems are generated by the refrigerants industry (580 MtCO2-eq yr –1 as F-gases) and the fertiliser industry for ammonia production (280 MtCO2-eq yr –1 as CO2) and nitric acid (60 MtCO2-eq yr –1 as N2O). The industry sector data account for CO2 stored in urea (–50 MtCO2-eq yr –1). Packaging contributed about 6% of total food system emissions (0.98 GtCO2-eq yr –1, 91% as CO2, with CH4 emissions of 2.8 Mt CH4 yr –1). Major emissions sources are pulp and paper (60 MtCO2-eq yr –1) and aluminium (30 MtCO2-eq yr –1), with ferrous metals, glass, and plastics making a smaller contribution. High shares of emissions from packaging are found for beverages and some fruit and vegetables (Poore and Nemecek 2018).Waste: Management of waste generated in the food system (including food waste, wastewater, packaging waste, etc.) leads to biogenic GHG emissions, and contributed 1.7 GtCO2-eq yr –1 to food systems’ GHG emissions in 2018. Of these emissions, 55% were from domestic and commercial wastewater (30 MtCH4 yr –1 and 310 ktN2O yr –1), 36% from solid waste management (20 MtCH4 yr –1 and 310 ktN2O yr –1), and 8% from industrial wastewater (4 MtCH4 yr –1 and 80 ktN2O yr –1). Emissions from waste incineration and other waste management systems contributed 1%.
