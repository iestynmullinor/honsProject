Choice architecture: Information is more effective if accompanied by reinforcement through structural changes or by changing the food environment, such as through product placement in supermarkets, to overcome the intention–behaviour gap (Bucher et al. 2016; Broers et al. 2017; Tørris and Mobekk 2019). Behavioural change strategies have also been shown to improve efficiencies of school food programmes (Marcano-Olivier et al. 2020).Environmental considerations rank behind financial, health, or sensory factors for determining citizens’ food choices (Leach et al. 2016; Hartmann and Siegrist 2017; Neff et al. 2018; Rose 2018; Gustafson et al. 2019). There is evidence that choice architecture (‘nudging’) can be effective in influencing purchase decisions, but regulators do not normally explore this option (Broers et al. 2017). Examples of green nudging include making the sustainable option the default option, enhancing visibility, accessibility of, or exposure to, sustainable products and reducing visibility and accessibility of unsustainable products, or increasing the salience of healthy sustainable choices through social norms or food labels (Bucher et al. 2016; Wilson et al. 2016; Broers et al. 2017; Al-Khudairy et al. 2019; Bauer and Reisch 2019; Ferrari et al. 2019; Weinrich and Elshiewy 2019; Cialdini and Jacobson 2021). Available evidence suggests that choice architecture measures are relatively inexpensive and easy to implement (Ferrari et al. 2019; Tørris and Mobekk 2019), they are a preferred solution if a restriction of choices is to be avoided (Wilson et al. 2016; Kraak et al. 2017; Vecchio and Cavallo 2019), and can be effective (Arno and Thomas 2016; Bucher et al. 2016; Bianchi et al. 2018b; Cadario and Chandon 2018) if embedded in policy packages (Wilson et al. 2016; Tørris and Mobekk 2019) (medium evidence, high agreement ).Choice architecture measures are also facilitated by growing market shares of animal-free protein sources taken up by discount chains and fast food companies, that enhance visibility of new products and ease integration into daily life for consumers, particularly if sustainable products are similar to the products they substitute (Slade 2018). This effect can be further increased by media and role models (Elgaaied-Gambier et al. 2018).
