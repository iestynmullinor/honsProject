Insights from regions, sectors, and communities:•Due to the dominating amount of literature from Developed Countries and rapidly developing Asia (China), the evidence and therefore conclusions are limited for the developing world. In particular, there is limited evidence on the potential and costs the countries of South-East Asia and Pacific, Africa, and Latin America and Caribbean.•The contribution of indigenous knowledge in the evolvement of buildings is not well appreciated. There is a need to understand this contribution and provide methodological approaches for incorporation of indigenous knowledge.•Analysis of emissions and energy demand trends in non-residential buildings is limited due to the number of building types included in this category and the scarcity of data for each building type. The use of new data gathering techniques such as machine learning, GIS combined with digital technologies to fill in this data gap was not identified in the literature. Consideration of embodied emissions from building stock growth has only recently entered the global scenario literature, and more development is expected in this area.Measures, potentials, and costs:•There is a lack of scientific reporting of case studies of exemplary buildings, specially from developing countries. Also, there is a lack of identification of researchers on technologies with the mitigation potential of such technologies, bringing a lack in quantification of that potential.•There is limited evidence on sufficiency measures including those from behavioural energy saving practices: updated categorisations, current adoption rates and willingness to adopt.•There is limited evidence on circular and shared economy in buildings, including taxonomies, potentials, current adoption rates and willingness to adopt.•Most of the literature on climate change impacts on buildings is focused on thermal comfort. There is need for further research on climate change impacts on buildings structure, materials and construction and the energy and emissions associated with those impacts. Also, more studies that assess the role of passive energy efficiency measures as adaptation options are needed. Finally, regional studies leave out in depth analyses of specific regions.Feasibility and policies:•Applications of human centred profiles for targeted policy making and considering stages of diffusion of innovation, that is: what works (motivation) for whom (different stakeholders, not only households) and when (stages of market maturity).•The multiple co-benefits of mitigation actions are rarely integrated into decision-making processes. So, there is a need to further develop methodologies to quantify and monetise these externalities as well as indicators to facilitate their incorporation in energy planning.•Policies for sufficiency have to be further analysed and tested in real situation, including ex ante simulation and ex post  evaluation. The same is also valid for Personable (tradable) Carbon Allowances.Methods and models:•There is limited literature on the integration of behavioural measures and lifestyle changes in modelling exercises.•Mitigation potential resulting from the implementation of sufficiency measures is not identified in global energy/climate and building scenarios despite the growing literature on sufficiency. At the best, mitigation potential from behaviour change is quantified in energy scenarios; savings from structural changes and resource efficiency are not identified in the literature on global and building energy models.•The actual costs of the potential could be higher to rather optimistic assumptions of the modelling literature, for example, assuming a 2–3% retrofit rate, and even higher, versus the current 1%. The uncertainty ranges of potential costs are not well understood.•Despite a large number of exemplary buildings achieving very high performance in all parts of the world and a growing amount of modelling literature on the potential, if these will penetrate at scale, there is a lack of modelling literature assessing the costs of respective actions at national, regional, and global level based on comprehensive cost assessments.•There is a lack of peer-reviewed literature on investment gaps, which compares the investment need in the building sector decarbonisation and recent investment flows into it estimated with the same costing methodologies.
