Building types and their composition affect the energy consumption for building operation as well as the GHG emissions (Hachem-Vermette and Singh 2019). They also influence the energy cost (MacNaughton et al. 2015) therefore, an identification of building type is required to understand the heterogeneity of this sector. Buildings are classified as residential and non-residential buildings. Residential buildings can be classified as slums, single-family house and multi-family house or apartment/flats building. Single-family house can be divided between single-family detached (including cottages, house barns, etc.) and single-family attached (or terrace house, small multi-family, etc.). Another classification is per ownership: owner-occupiers, landlords, and ownersâ€™ association/condominiums.Non-residential buildings have a much broader use. They include cultural buildings (which include theatres and performance, museums and exhibits, libraries, and cultural centres), educational buildings (kindergarten, schools, higher education, research centre, and laboratories), sports (recreation and training, and stadiums), healthcare buildings (health, well-being, and veterinary), hospitality (hotel, casino, lodging, nightlife buildings, and restaurants and bars), commercial buildings and offices (institutional buildings, markets, office buildings, retail, and shopping centres), public buildings (government buildings, security, and military buildings), religious buildings (including worship and burial buildings), and industrial buildings (factories, energy plants, warehouses, data centres, transportation buildings, and agricultural buildings).
