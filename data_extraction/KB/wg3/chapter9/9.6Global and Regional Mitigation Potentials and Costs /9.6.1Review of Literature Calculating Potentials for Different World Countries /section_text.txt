Section 9.4 provides an update on technological options and practices, which allow constructing and retrofitting individual buildings to produce very low emissions during their operation phase. Since AR5, the world has seen a growing number of such buildings in all populated continents, and a growing amount of literature calculates the mitigation potential for different countries if such technologies and practices penetrate at scale. Figure 9.15 synthesises the results of sixty-seven bottom-up studies, which rely on the bottom-up technology-reach approach and assess the potential of such technologies and practices, aggregated to stock of corresponding products and/or buildings at national level.Figure 9.15 | Potential GHG emission reduction in buildings of different world countries grouped by region, as reported by sixty-seven bottom-up studies.

Nearly all studies, which assess the technological potential assume such usage of space heating, cooling, water heating, and lighting that does not exceed health, living, and working standards, thus realising at least a part of the non-technological potential, as presented in Figure 9.14. The results presented in Figure 9.15 relate to measures applied within the boundaries of the building sector, including the reduction in direct and indirect emissions. The results exclude the impact of decarbonisation measures applied within the boundaries of the energy supply sector, that is, the decarbonisation of grid electricity and district heat.The analysis of Figure 9.15 illustrates that there is a large body of literature attesting to mitigation potential in the countries of Europe and North America of up to 55–85% and in Asia-Pacific Developed of up to 45% in 2050, as compared to their sector baseline emissions, even though they sometimes decline. For developing countries, the literature estimates the potential of up to 40–80% in 2050, as compared to their sharply growing baselines. The interpretation of these estimates should be cautious because the studies rely on assumptions with uncertainties and feasibility constrains (see Sections 9.6.4, Figure 9.20 and Supplementary Material Table 9.SM.6).The novelty since AR5 is emerging bottom-up literature, which attempts to account for potential at national and global level from applying the sufficiency approach (see Box 9.1 in Section 9.1 and decomposition analysis in Section 9.3.2). In spite of the reducing energy use per unit of floor area at an average rate of 1.3% per year, the growth of floor area at an average rate of 3% per year causes rising energy demand and GHG emissions because each new square meter must be served with thermal comfort and/or other amenities  (International Energy Agency 2017; Ellsworth-Krebs 2020). Nearly all studies reviewed in Figure 9.15 assume the further growth of floor area per capita until 2050, with many studies of developing countries targeting today per capita floor area as in Europe.Table 9.4 reviews the bottom-up literature, which quantifies the potential from reorganisation of human activities, efficient design, planning, and use of building space, higher density of building and settlement inhabitancy, redefining and downsizing goods and equipment, limiting their use to health, living, and working standards, and their sharing, recognising the number of square meters and devices as a determinant of GHG emissions that could be impacted via policies and measures. Nearly all national or regional studies originate from Europe and North America recognising challenges, Developed Countries face toward decarbonisation. Thus, Goldstein et al. (2020) suggested prioritising the reduction in floor space of wealthier population and more efficient space planning because grid decarbonisation is not enough to meet the U.S. target by 2050 whereas affluent suburbs may have 15 times higher emission footprints than nearby neighbourhoods. Cabrera Serrenho et al. (2019) argue that reducing the UK floor area is a low cost mitigation option given a low building replacement rate and unreasonably high retrofit costs of existing buildings. Lorek and Spangenberg (2019) discusses the opportunity of reducing building emissions in Germany fitting better the structure of the dwelling stock to the declined average household size, as most dwellings have 3–4 rooms while most households have only one person.Whereas these studies suggest sufficiency as an important option for Developed Countries, global studies argue that it is also important for the developing world. This is because it provides the means to address inequality, poverty reduction and social inclusion, ensuring the provision of acceptable living standards for the entire global population given the planetary boundaries. As Figure 9.6 illustrates, the largest share of current construction occurs in developing countries, while these countries follow a similar demographic track of declining household sizes versus increasing dwelling areas. This trajectory translates into the importance of their awareness of the likely similar forthcoming challenges, and the need in early efficient planning of infrastructure and buildings with a focus on space usage and density.Table 9.4 | Potential GHG emission reduction in the building sector offered by the introduction of sufficiency as a main or additional measure, as reported by bottom-up (or hybrid) literature. RegionReferenceScenario and its resultSufficiency for floor spaceGlobeGrubler et al.(2018)The Low Energy Demand Scenario halves the final energy demand of buildings by 2050,as compared the WEO Current Policy (International Energy Agency 2019c) by modellingthe changes in quantity, types, and energy intensity of services.The scenario assumed a reduction in theresidential and non-residential building floorarea to 29 and 11 m 2 cap –1 respectively.GlobeMillward-Hopkinset al. (2020)With the changes in structural and technological intensity, the Decent Living Energy scenario achieved the decent living standard for all while reducing the final energy consumption of buildings by factor three, as compared to the WEO Current Policy Scenario (International Energy Agency 2019c).The scenario assumed a reduction in floor areato 15 m 2 cap –1 across the world.GlobeLevesque et al.(2019)Realising both the technological and sufficiency potential, the Low Demand Scenarioand the Very Low Demand Scenario calculated a reduction in global building energydemand by 32% and 45% in 2050, as compared to the business-as-usual baseline.The Low Scenario limited the residential andnon-residential floor area to 70 and 23 m 2 cap –1;the Very Low Scenario – to 45 and 15 m 2 cap –1.EUBierwirth andThomas (2019b)For the EU residential sector, the authors calculated potential energy savings of 17%and 29% from setting the per capita floor area limits.A reduction of the residential floor area to 30 m 2 cap –1 and 35 m 2 cap –1, respectively.EURoscini et al.(2020)With the help of technological and non-technological measures, the Responsible PolicyScenario for the EU buildings allows achieving the emission reduction by 60% in 2030,as compared to 2015.The scenario assumed 6% decrease in theresidential per capita floor area (to max.44.8 m 2 cap –1).Canada, UK,France, Italy,Japan, USA,GermanyHertwich et al.(2020)The potential reduction in GHG emissions from the production of building materialsis 56–58% in 2050, as compared to these baseline emissions. The reduction in heatingand cooling energy demand is 9–10% in 2050, as compared to its baseline.Via the efficient use of living space, the scenarioassumed its 20% reduction, as compared to itsbaseline development.UKCabrera Serrenhoet al.

In 2050, the final energy savings are 21% and 28% for the residential and tertiary sectors respectively, as compared to their baselines.The scenario assumes a limit of the residentialfloor at 42 m 2 cap –1 due to apartment sharingand compact urban planning.FranceVirage-EnergieNord-Pas-de-Calais. (2016)The authors assessed sufficiency opportunities across all sectors for the Nord-Pas-de-Calaisregion of France. Depending on the level of implementation, sufficiency could reduce theenergy consumption of residential and tertiary buildings by 13–30% in 2050, as comparedto the baseline.The scenario assumed sharing spaces,downsizing spaces and sharing equipmentfrom a ‘soft’ to ‘radical’ degree.
