According to World Health Organization (2018) around 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide (in both cities and rural areas) are attributed to outdoor air pollution. According to the results of the quantitative model (Gu et al. 2018), the premature mortalities attributed to PM2.5 and O3 emissions may reach 168000–1796000 (95% Cl) in 2010. Mitigation actions in residential and non-residential sectors decrease the amount of fossil fuels burnt either directly in buildings (for heating, cooking, etc.) or indirectly for electricity generation and thereby reduce air pollution (e.g., PM, O3, SO2, NOx), improve ambient air quality and generate significant health benefits through avoiding premature deaths, lung cancers, ischemic heart diseases, hospital admissions, asthma exacerbations, respiratory symptoms, and so on (Levy et al. 2016; Balaban and Puppim de Oliveira 2017; MacNaughton et al. 2018; Karlsson et al. 2020). Several studies have monetised the health benefits attributed to reduced outdoor air pollution due to the implementation of mitigation actions in buildings, and their magnitude expressed as a ratio to the value of energy savings resulting from the implemented interventions in each case, are in the range of 0.08 in EU, 0.18 in Germany, 0.26–0.40 in US, 0.34 in Brazil, 0.47 in Mexico, 0.74 in Turkey, 8.28 in China and 11.67 in India (Joyce et al. 2013; Levy et al. 2016; Diaz-Mendez et al. 2018; MacNaughton et al. 2018). In developed economies, the estimated co-benefits are relatively low due to the fact that the planned interventions influence a quite clean energy source mix (Tuomisto et al. 2015; MacNaughton et al. 2018). On the other hand, the health co-benefits in question are substantially higher in countries and regions with greater dependency on coal for electricity generation and higher baseline morbidity and mortality rates (Kheirbek et al. 2014; MacNaughton et al. 2018).
