In a flexible behaviour, the desired level of service is the same, but it can be shifted over time, typically allowing automated control, for the benefit of the electricity or district heating networks. There are substantial economic, technical, and behavioural benefits from implementing flexibility measures (Mata et al. 2020c), with unknown social impacts.With demand-side measures (DSM), such as shifting demand a few hours, peak net demand can be reduced by up to 10–20% (Stötzer et al. 2015); a similar potential is available for short-term load shifting during evening hours (Aryandoust and Lilliestam 2017). Although different household types show different consumption patterns and thus an individual availability of DSM capacity during the day (Fischer et al. 2017), there is limited (Shivakumar et al. 2018) or inexistent (Drysdale et al. 2015; Nilsson et al. 2017) information of consumers’ response to time of use pricing, specifically among those living in apartments (Bartusch and Alvehag 2014). Behavioural benefits are identified in terms of increased level of energy awareness of the users (Rehm et al. 2018), measured deliberate attempts of the consumers to reduce and/or shift their electricity usage (Bradley et al. 2016). Real-time control and behavioural change influence 40% of the electricity use during the operational life of non-residential buildings (Kamilaris et al. 2014).
