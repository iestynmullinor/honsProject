Adjustment in the set-point temperature in winter and summer results in savings between 5% and 25% (Ayoub et al. 2014; Christidou et al. 2014; Taniguchi et al. 2016; Sun and Hong 2017). As introduced in Section 9.3, a series of recent works study a cap on the living area (Mata et al. 2021a) or an increase in household size (Berrill et al. 2021). These studies are promising but of limited complexity in terms of rebounds, interactions with other measures, and business models, thus require further investigation. Professional assistance and training on these issues is limited (Maxwell et al. 2018).Willingness to adopt is found for certain measures (full load to laundry appliances, lid on while cooking, turning lights off, defer electricity usage and HVAC systems, adjust set-point temperature by 1°C) but not for others (appliances on standby, using more clothes, avoid leaving the TV on while doing other things, defer ovens, ironing or heating systems, adjust set-point temperature by 3°C, move to a low energy house or smaller apartment) (Yohanis 2012; Brown et al. 2013; Li et al. 2017; Sköld et al. 2018). A positive synergy with digitalisation and smart home appliances is identified, driven by a combination of comfort requirements and economic interest, confirmed by a willingness to defer electricity usage in exchange for cost savings (Ferreira et al. 2018; Mata et al. 2020c).
