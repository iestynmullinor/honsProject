Non-technological CSE solutions, based on the Regenerate, Share, Optimise, Loop, Virtualise, Exchange (ReSOLVE) framework (CE100 2016; ARUP 2018) include sharing, virtualising and exchanging. These are less studied than circular materials, with notably less investigation of existing buildings and sharing solutions (Pomponi and Moncaster 2017; Høibye and Sand 2018; Kyrö 2020; European Commission 2020).The sharing economy generates an increased utilisation rate of products or systems by enabling or offering shared use, access or ownership of products and assets that have a low ownership or use rate. Measures include conditioned spaces (accommodation, facility rooms, offices) as well as tools and transfer of ownership (i.e., second-hand or donation) (Rademaekers et al. 2017; Mercado 2018; Hertwich et al. 2020; Cantzler et al. 2020; Harris et al. 2021; Mata et al. 2021a). The evidence on the link between user behaviour and net environmental impacts of sharing options is still limited (Laurenti et al. 2019; Mata et al. 2020a; Harris et al. 2021) and even begins to be questioned, due to rebounds that partially or fully offset the benefits (Agrawal and Bellos 2017; Zink and Geyer 2017). For example, the costs savings from reduced ownership can be allocated to activities with a higher carbon intensity, or result in increased mobility. Both reduced ownership and other circular consumption habits show no influence on material footprint, other than mildly positive influence in low-income households (Junnila et al. 2018; Ottelin et al. 2020).
