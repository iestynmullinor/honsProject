Cooperative efforts are necessary to improve buildings energy efficiency (Masuda and Claridge 2014; Kamilaris et al. 2014; Ruparathna et al. 2016). For instance, interdisciplinary understanding of organisational culture, occupant behaviour, and technology adoption is required to set up occupancy/operation best practises (Janda 2014). Similarly, close collaboration of all actors along the value chain can reduce by 50% emissions from concrete use (Habert et al. 2020); such collaboration can be enhanced in a construction project by transforming the project organisation and delivery contract to reduce costs and environmental impact (Hall and Bonanomi 2021). Building commissioning helps to reduce energy consumption by streamlining the systems, but benefits may not persist. Energy communities are discussed later in the chapter.NT challenges include training and software costs (tailored learning programs, learning-by-doing, human capital mobilisation), client and market demand (service specification, design and provision, market and financial analysis) and legal issues (volatile energy prices, meeting regulation); and partnership, governance and commercialisation. These challenges are identified for Building Information Modelling (BIM) (Oduyemi et al. 2017; Rahman and Ayer 2019), PV industry (Triana et al. 2018), smart living (Solaimani et al. 2015) or circular economy (Vence and Pereira 2019).
