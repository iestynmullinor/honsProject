Bioclimatic design and passive strategies for natural heating, cooling and lighting, can greatly reduce buildings’ climate impact, and avoid cooling in developing countries (Bienvenido-Huertas et al. 2021, 2020; Amirifard et al. 2019). Design can provide additional small savings, for example, by placing refrigerator away from the oven, radiators or windows (Christidou et al. 2014). Passive management refers to adjustments in human behaviour such as adapted clothing, allocation of activities in the rooms of the building to minimise the energy use (Klein et al. 2012; Rafsanjani et al. 2015) or manual operation of the building envelope (Rijal et al. 2012; Volochovic et al. 2012). Quantitative modelling of such measures is most common for non-residential buildings, in which adaptive behaviours are affected by the office space distribution and interior design, amount of occupants, visual comfort, outdoor view, and easy-to-use control mechanisms (O’Brien and Gunay 2014; Talele et al. 2018). Socio-demographic factors, personal characteristics and contextual factors also influence occupant behaviour and their interactions with buildings (D’Oca et al. 2018b; Hong et al. 2020).Active management refers to human control of building energy systems. Efficient lighting practices can effectively reduce summer peak demand (Dixon et al. 2015; Taniguchi et al. 2016). On the contrary, the application of the daylight-saving time in the US increases up to 7% lighting consumption (Rakha et al. 2018). Efficient cooking practices for cooking, appliance use (e.g., avoid stand-by regime, select eco-mode), or for hot water can save up to 25% (Peschiera and Taylor 2012; Teng et al. 2012; Abrahamse and Steg 2013; Berezan et al. 2013; Hsiao et al. 2014; Dixon et al. 2015; Reichert et al. 2016). High behavioural control is so far proven difficult to achieve (Ayoub et al. 2014; Sköld et al. 2018). Automated controls and technical measures to trigger occupant operations are addressed in Section 9.4.
