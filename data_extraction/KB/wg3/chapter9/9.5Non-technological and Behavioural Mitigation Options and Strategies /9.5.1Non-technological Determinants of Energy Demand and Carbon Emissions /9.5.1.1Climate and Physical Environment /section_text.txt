Outdoor temperature, heating and cooling degree days, sunshine hours, rainfall, humidity and wind are highly determinant of energy demand (Tol et al. 2012; Rosenberg 2014; Harold et al. 2015; Risch and Salmon 2017; Lindberg et al. 2019). Density, compacity, and spatial effects define the surrounding environment and urban microclimate. Urban residents usually have a relatively affluent lifestyle, but use less energy for heating (Niu et al. 2012; Huang 2015; Rafiee et al. 2019; Ayoub 2019; Oh and Kim 2019). Urbanisation is discussed in Chapter 8.Climate variability and extreme events may drastically increase peak and annual energy consumption (Hong et al. 2013; Cui et al. 2017; Mashhoodi et al. 2019). Climate change effects on future demand and emissions, are discussed in Section 9.7, and effects of temperature on health and productivity, in Section 9.8.
