Income is positively correlated to energy demand (Cayla et al. 2011; Sreekanth et al. 2011; Couture et al. 2012; Moura et al. 2015; Singh et al. 2017; Yu 2017; Bissiri et al. 2019; Mata et al. 2021b). High-income households tend to use more efficient appliances and are likely to be more educated and environmentally sensitive, but their higher living standards require more energy (Harold et al. 2015; Hidalgo et al. 2018). Low-income households are in higher risk of fuel poverty (Section 9.8).Mixed effects are found for household size, age, gender, ethnicity, education levels and tenancy status (Engvall et al. 2014; Hansen 2016; Lévy and Belaïd 2018; Arawomo 2019; Rafiee et al. 2019). Single-parent and elderly households consume more gas and electricity, and gender has no significant effect (Brounen et al. 2012; Harold et al. 2015; Huang 2015). Similarly, larger families use less electricity per capita (Bedir et al. 2013; Kavousian et al. 2013). Heating expenditure tends to be higher for owners than for renters, despite the formers tendency to have more efficient appliances (Gillingham et al. 2012; Davis, 2012; Kavousian et al. 2015).
