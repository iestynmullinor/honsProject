Occupants presence and movement, interactions with the building, comfort-driven adaptations and cultural practices determine energy consumption (Hong et al. 2017; Yan et al. 2017; D’Oca et al. 2018; Khosla et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019; O’Brien et al. 2020). Households consume more on weekends and public holidays, and households with employed occupants consume less than self-employed occupants, probably because some of the latter jobs are in-house (Harold et al. 2015; Hidalgo et al. 2018). Understanding and accurate modelling of occupant behaviour is crucial to reduce the gap between design and energy performance (Gunay et al. 2013; Yan et al. 2017), especially for more efficient buildings, which rely on passive design features, human-centred technologies, and occupant engagement (Grove-Smith et al. 2018; Pitts 2017).
