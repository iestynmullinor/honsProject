Building typology and floor area (or e.g., number of bedrooms or lot size) are correlated to energy demand (Manzano-Agugliaro et al. 2015; Moura et al. 2015; Fosas et al. 2018; Morganti et al. 2019; Berrill et al. 2021). Affluence is embedded in these variables as higher-income households have larger homes and lots. Residential consumption increases with the number of occupants but consumption per capita decreases proportionally to it (Serrano et al. 2017). Construction or renovation year has a negative correlation as recently built buildings must comply with increasingly strict standards (Brounen et al. 2012; Kavousian et al. 2015; Ã–sterbring et al. 2016). Only for electricity consumption no significant correlation is observed to building age (Kavousian et al. 2013). Material choices, bioclimatic and circular design discussed in Section 9.4.2.
