The circular and sharing economy begins to be perceived as organisational and technologically innovative, with the potential to provide superior customer value, response to societal trends and positive marketing (Mercado 2018; Cantzler et al. 2020; Nußholz et al. 2020). Although technical and regulatory challenges remain, there are key difficulties around the demonstration of a business case for both consumers and the supply chain (Pomponi and Moncaster 2017; Hart et al. 2019).Government support is needed as an initiator but also to reinforce building retroﬁt targets, promote more stringent energy and material standards for new constructions, and protect consumer interests (Hongping 2017; Fischer and Pascucci 2017; Patwa et al. 2020). Taxes clearly incentivise waste reduction and recycling (Rachel and Travis 2011; Ajayi et al. 2015; Volk et al. 2019). In developing countries, broader, international, market boundaries can allow for a more attractive business model (Mohit et al. 2020). Participative and new ownership models can favour the adoption of prefabricated buildings (Steinhardt and Manley 2016). Needs for improvements are observed, in terms of design for flexibility and deconstruction, procurement and prefabrication and off-site construction, standardisation and dimensional coordination, with differences among solutions (Osmani 2012; Coehlo et al.2013; Lu and Yuan 2013; Cossu and Williams 2015; Schiller et al. 2015, 2017; Ajayi et al. 2017; Bakshan et al. 2017).Although training is a basic requirement, attitude, past experience, and social pressure can also be highly relevant, as illustrated for waste management in a survey to construction site workers (Amal et al. 2017). Traditional community practices of reuse of building elements are observed to be replaced by a culture of waste (Ajayi et al. 2015; Hongping 2017).
