In North America and Europe, personal attitudes, values, and existing information and support are the most and equally important reasons for improving the building envelope. Consumers have some economic concerns and little technical concerns, the latter related to the performance and maintenance of the installed solutions (Mata et al. 2021a). In other world regions or climate zones the literature is limited.Motivations are often triggered by urgent comfort or replacement needs. Maintaining the aesthetic value may as well hinder the installation of insulation if no technical solutions are easily available (Haines and Mitchell 2014; Bright et al. 2019). Local professionals and practitioners can both encourage (Friege 2016; Ozarisoy and Altan 2017) and discourage the installation of insulation, according to their knowledge and training (Curtis et al. 2017; Zuhaib et al. 2017; Maxwell et al. 2018; Tsoka et al. 2018). If energy renovations of the buildings envelopes are not normative, cooperative ownership may be a barrier in apartment buildings (Miezis et al. 2016). Similarly, product information and labelling may be helpful or overwhelming (Ozarisoy and Altan 2017; Lilley et al. 2017; Bright et al. 2019). Decisions are correlated to governmental support (Swantje et al. 2015; Tam et al. 2016) and peer information (Friege et al. 2016; Friege 2016).The intervention is required to be cost efficient, although value could be placed in the amount of energy saved (Mortensen et al. 2016; Lilley et al. 2017; Howarth and Roberts 2018; Kim et al. 2019) or the short payback period (Miezis et al. 2016). Subsidies have a positive effect (Swan et al. 2017).
