Studies on low-carbon materials tend to focus on wood-based building systems and prefabricated housing construction, mostly in high-income countries, as many sustainable managed forestries and factories for prefabricated housing concentrated in such regions (Mata et al. 2021a). This uneven promotion of wood can lead to its overconsumption (Pomponi et al. 2020).Although the solutions are not yet implemented at scale, examples include the adoption of low carbon cement in Cuba motivated by the possibility of supplying the rising demand with low initial investment costs (Cancio DÃ­az et al. 2017) or adoption of bamboo-based social houses in The Philippines motivated by local job creation and typhoon resistance (Zea Escamilla et al. 2016). More generally, low investment costs and high level decision-making, for example, political will and environmental values of society, increase the adoption rate of low-carbon materials (Steinhardt and Manley 2016; Lien and Lolli 2019; Hertwich et al. 2020). In contrast, observed barriers include lobbying by traditional materials industries, short-term political decision making (Tozer 2019) and concerns over technical performance, risk of damage, and limited alternatives available (Thomas et al. 2014).
