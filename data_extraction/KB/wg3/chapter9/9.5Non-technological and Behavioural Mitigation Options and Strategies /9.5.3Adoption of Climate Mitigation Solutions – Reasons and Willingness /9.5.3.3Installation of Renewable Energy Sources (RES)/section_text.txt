Although consumers are willing to install distributed RES worldwide, and information has successfully supported their roll out, economic and governmental support is still necessary for their full deployment. Technical issues remain for either very novel technologies or for the integration of RES in the energy system (Ãœrge-Vorsatz et al. 2020; Mata et al. 2021a). Capacities are to be built by coordinated actions by all stakeholders (Musonye et al. 2020). To this aim, energy communities and demonstrative interventions at local scale are key to address technical, financial, regulatory and structural barriers and document long-term benefits (von Wirth et al. 2018; Shafique et al. 2020; Fouladvand et al. 2020).Regarding solar technologies, heterogeneous decisions are formed by socio-demographic, economic and technical predictors interwoven with a variety of behavioural traits (Alipour et al. 2020; Khan 2020). Studies on PV adoption confirm place-specific (various spatial and peer effects), multi-scalar cultural dynamics (Bollinger and Gillingham 2012; Schaffer and Brun 2015; Graziano and Gillingham 2015). Environmental concern and technophilia drive the earliest PV adopters, while later adopters value economic gains (Hampton and Eckermann 2013; Jager-Waldau et al. 2018; Abreu et al. 2019; Palm 2020). Previous experience with similar solutions increases adoption (Baumhof et al. 2018; Qurashi and Ahmed 2019; Bach et al. 2020; Reindl and Palm 2020).
