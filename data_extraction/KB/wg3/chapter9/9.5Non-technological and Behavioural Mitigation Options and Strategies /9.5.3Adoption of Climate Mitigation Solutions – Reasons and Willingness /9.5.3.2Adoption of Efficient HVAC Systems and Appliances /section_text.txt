Mixed willingness is found to adopt efficient technologies. While Developed Countries are positive towards building envelope technologies, appliances such as A-rated equipment or condensing boilers are negatively perceived (Yohanis 2012). In contrast, adopters in Asia are positive towards energy-saving appliances (Liao et al. 2020; Spandagos et al. 2020).Comfort, economic and ecological aspects, as well as information influence the purchase of a heating system (Claudy et al. 2011; Decker and Menrad 2015). Information and support from different stakeholders are the most relevant aspects in different geographical contexts (Hernandez-Roman et al. 2017; Tumbaz and Moğulkoç 2018; Curtis et al. 2018; Bright et al. 2019; Chu and Wang 2019).Among high-income countries, economy aspects have positive effects, specially reductions in energy bills and financial incentives or subsidies (Chun and Jiang 2013; Christidou et al. 2014; Mortensen et al. 2016; Clancy et al. 2017; Ketchman et al. 2018). Having complementary technologies already in place also has positively affects adoption (Zografakis et al. 2012; Clancy et al. 2017), but performance and maintenance concerns appear as barriers (Qiu et al. 2014). The solutions are positively perceived as high-technology innovative, to enhance status, and are supported by peers and own-environmental values (Mortensen et al. 2016; Heiskanen and Matschoss 2017; Ketchman et al. 2018).
