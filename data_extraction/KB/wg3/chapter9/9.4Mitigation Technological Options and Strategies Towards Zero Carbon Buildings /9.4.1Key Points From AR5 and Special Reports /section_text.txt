The AR5 WG3 Chapter 9 on Buildings (Lucon et al. 2014) presents mitigation technology options and practices to achieve large reductions in building energy use as well as a synthesis of documented examples of large reductions in energy use achieved in real, new, and retrofitted buildings in a variety of different climates and examples of costs at building level. A key point highlighted is the fact that the conventional process of designing and constructing buildings and its systems is largely linear, losing opportunities for the optimisation of whole buildings. Several technologies are listed as being able to achieve significant performance improvements and cost potentials (daylighting and electric lighting, household appliances, insulation materials, heat pumps, indirect evaporative cooling, advances in digital building automation and control systems, and smart meters and grids to implement renewable electricity sources).
