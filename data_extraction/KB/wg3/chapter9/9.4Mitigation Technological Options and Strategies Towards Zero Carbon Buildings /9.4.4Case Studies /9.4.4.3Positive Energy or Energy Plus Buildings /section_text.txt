The integration of energy generation on-site means further contribution of buildings towards decarbonisation (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2020). Integration of renewables in buildings should always come after maximising the reduction in the demand for energy services through sufficiency measures and maximising efficiency improvement to reduce energy consumption, but the inclusion of energy generation would mean a step forward to distributed energy systems with high contribution from buildings, becoming prosumers (Sánchez Ramos et al. 2019). Decrease price of technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) and the integration of energy storage (de Gracia and Cabeza 2015) are essential to achieve this objective. Other technologies that could be used are photovoltaic/thermal (Sultan and Ervina Efzan 2018), solar/biomass hybrid systems (Zhang et al. 2020b), solar thermoelectric (Sarbu and Dorca 2018), solar powered sorption systems for cooling (Shirazi et al. 2018), and on-site renewables with battery storage (Liu et al. 2021).
