Historical buildings, defined as those built before 1945, are usually low-performance buildings by definition from the space heating point of view and represent almost 30â€“40% of the whole building stock in European countries (Cabeza et al. 2018a). Historical buildings often contribute to townscape character, they create the urban spaces that are enjoyed by residents and attract tourist visitors. They may be protected by law from alteration not only limited to their visual appearance preservation, but also concerning materials and construction techniques to be integrated into original architectures. On the other hand, a heritage building is a historical building which, for their immense value, is subject to legal preservation. The integration of renewable energy systems in such buildings is more challenging than in other buildings. In the review carried out by Cabeza et al. (2018a) different case studies are presented and discussed, where heat pumps, solar energy and geothermal energy systems are integrated in such buildings, after energy efficiency is considered.
