District heating networks have evolved from systems where heat was produced by coal or waste and storage was in the form of steam, to much higher energy efficiency networks with water or glycol as the energy carrier and fuelled by a wide range of renewable and low carbon fuels. Common low carbon fuels for district energy systems include biomass, other renewables (i.e., geothermal, PV, and large solar thermal), industry surplus heat or power-to-heat concepts, and heat storage including seasonal heat storage (Lund et al. 2018). District energy infrastructure opens opportunities for integration of several heat and power sources and is ‘future proof’ in the sense that the energy source can easily be converted or upgraded in the future, with heat distributed through the existing district energy network. Latest developments include the inclusion of smart control and AI (Revesz et al. 2020), and low temperature thermal energy districts. Authors show carbon emissions reduction up to 80% compared to the use of gas boilers.
