Warehouses are major contributors to the rise of greenhouse gas emissions in supply chains (Bartolini et al. 2019). The expanding e-commerce sector and the growing demand for mass customisation have even led to an increasing need for warehouse space and buildings, particularly for serving the uninterrupted customer demand in the business-to-consumer market. Although warehouses are not specifically designed to provide their inhabitants with comfort because they are mainly unoccupied, the impact of their activities in the global GHG emissions is remarkable. Warehousing activities contribute roughly 11% of the total GHG emissions generated by the logistics sector across the world. Following this global trend, increasing attention to green and sustainable warehousing processes has led to many new research results regarding management concepts, technologies, and equipment to reduce warehouses carbon footprint, that is, the total emissions of GHG in carbon equivalents directly caused by warehouses activities.
