There are many technologies that can reduce energy use in buildings (Finnegan et al. 2018; Kockat et al. 2018 a), and those have been extensively investigated. Other technologies that can contribute to achieving carbon zero buildings are less present in the literature. Common technologies available to achieve zero energy buildings were summarised in (Cabeza and Chàfer 2020) and are presented in Tables 9.SM.1 to 9.SM.3 in detail, where Figure 9.11 shows a summary.Figure 9.11 | Energy savings potential of technology strategies for climate change mitigation in buildings.

Earth architecture is still limited to a niche (Morel and Charef 2019). See also Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 13 for carbon dioxide removal and its role in mitigation strategies.
