Nearly zero energy (NZE) buildings or low-energy buildings are possible in all world relevant climate zones (Mata et al. 2020b; Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2020) (Figure 9.13). Moreover, they are possible both for new and retrofitted buildings. Different envelope design and technologies are needed, depending on the climate and the building shape and orientation. For example, using the Passive House standard an annual heating and cooling energy demand decrease between 75% and 95% compared to conventional values can be achieved. Table 9.2 lists several exemplary low- and NZE-buildings with some of their feature.Figure 9.13 | Regional distribution of documented low-energy buildings.
