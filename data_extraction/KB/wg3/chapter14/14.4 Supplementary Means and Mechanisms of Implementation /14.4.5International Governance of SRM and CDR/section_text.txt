While Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) were often referred to as ‘geoengineering’ in earlier IPCC reports and in the literature, IPCC SR1.5 started to explore SRM and CDR more thoroughly and to highlight the differences between – but also within – both approaches more clearly. This section assesses international governance of both SRM and CDR, recognising that CDR, as a mitigation option, is covered elsewhere in this report, whereas SRM is not. Chapter 12 of this report covers the emerging national, sub-national and non-state governance of CDR, while Chapters 6, 7 and 12 also assess the mitigation potential, risks and co-benefits of some CDR options. Chapters 4 and 5 of AR6 WGI assess the physical climate system and biogeochemical responses to different SRM and CDR methods. Cross-Working Group Box 4 on SRM (AR6 WGII, Chapter 16; and Cross-Working Group Box 4 in this chapter) gives a brief overview of Solar Radiation Modification methods, risks, benefits, ethics and governance.
