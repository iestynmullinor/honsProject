The Paris Agreement and the imperative for sustainable development reinforce the need to forge strong linkages between climate and development (Fay et al. 2015). This in turn has highlighted the urgent need for greater attention to the relationship between development assistance and finance, and climate change (Steele 2015).The UNFCCC website cites some 20 bilateral development agencies providing support to climate change programmes in developing countries (UNFCCC 2020a). These agencies provide a mix of development cooperation, policy advice and support and financing for climate change projects. Since the year 2000, the OECD Development Assistance Committee has been tracking trends in climate-related development finance and assistance. The amount of bilateral development finance with climate relevance has increased substantially since 2000 (OECD 2019a). For 2019, it was reported to be USD28.8 billion in direct finance and USD2.6 billion through export credit agencies. Further, another USD34.1 billion of the climate finance provided through multilateral channels is attributable to the developed countries (OECD 2021). The OECD methodology has been critiqued as it uses Rio markers, the limitations of which could lead to erroneous reporting and assessment of finance provided as well as of the mitigation outcome (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2011b; Weikmans and Roberts 2019). This issue is to be addressed through the modalities, procedures and guidance under the Enhanced Transparency Framework of the Paris Agreement (Section 14.3.2.4), through the mandate to the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to develop common tabular formats for the reporting of information on, inter alia, financial support provided, mobilised and received (UNFCCC 2019k). Until then, the Biennial Assessment Report prepared by the Standing Committee on Finance provides the best available information on financial support.
