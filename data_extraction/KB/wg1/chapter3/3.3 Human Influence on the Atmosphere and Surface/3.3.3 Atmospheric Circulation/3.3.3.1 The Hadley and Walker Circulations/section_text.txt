It is likely  that human influence has contributed to the poleward expansion of the zonal mean Hadley cell in the Southern Hemisphere since the 1980s. This assessment is supported by studies since AR5, which consistently find human influence from greenhouse gas increases on the expansion, with additional influence from ozone depletion in austral summer. For the strong ozone depletion period of 1981–2000, human influence is detectable in the summertime poleward expansion in the Southern Hemisphere (medium confidence). By contrast, there is medium confidence that the expansion of the zonal mean Hadley cell in the Northern Hemisphere is within the range of internal variability, with contributions from PDV and other internal variability. The causes of the observed strengthening of the Pacific Walker circulation over the 1980–2014 period are not well understood, since the observed strengthening trend is outside the range of variability simulated in the coupled models (medium confidence). Large observational uncertainty, lack of understanding of the mechanism underlying the poleward Hadley cell expansion, and contradicting theories on the greenhouse gas influence and uncertainty in the aerosol influence on the Walker circulation strength, limit confidence in these assessments.
