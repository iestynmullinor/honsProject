The AR5 assessed that it is likely  that anthropogenic forcing contributed to the surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet since 1993 (Bindoff et al., 2013). The SROCC did not directly assess the attribution of Greenland Ice Sheet change to anthropogenic forcing, but it did assess with medium confidence that summer melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet has increased to a level unprecedented over at least the last 350 years, which is two-to-fivefold the pre-industrial level (see also Trusel et al., 2018).(Section 2.3.2.4.1 assesses that Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss began in the latter half of the 19th century and that the rate of loss has increased substantially since the turn of the 21st century (high confidence), and also notes that integration of proxy evidence and modelling indicates that the last time the rate of mass loss was similar to the 20th century rate was during the early Holocene. Models of Greenland Ice Sheet evolution are evaluated in detail in Section 9.4.1.2, which assesses that there is overall medium confidence in these models. Model evaluation of surface mass balance changes over the Greenland Ice Sheet, including regional aspects, is also assessed in Atlas.11.2.3.Detection and attribution studies of change in the Greenland Ice Sheet remain challenging (Kjeldsen et al., 2015; Bamber et al., 2019). This is in part due to the short observational record (Shepherd et al., 2012, 2018, 2020; Bamber et al., 2018; Cazenave et al., 2018; Mouginot et al., 2019; Rignot et al., 2019) and the challenges this poses to the evaluation of modelling efforts (Section 9.4.1.2). The latter require not only dynamic ice-sheet models, but also appropriate atmospheric and oceanic conditions to use as a boundary forcing to drive the models (Nowicki and Seroussi, 2018; Barthel et al., 2020). Nonetheless, new literature since AR5 finds that ice-sheet mass balance calculations using reanalysis-driven regional model simulations of surface mass balance are found to agree well with the observed decrease in ice-sheet mass over the past twenty years (Fettweis et al., 2020; Sasgen et al., 2020; Tedesco and Fettweis, 2020), consistent with earlier studies (Flato et al., 2013). These studies also show that the exceptional melt events observed in 2012 and 2019 were associated with exceptional atmospheric conditions (Sasgen et al., 2020; Tedesco and Fettweis, 2020). These results support the finding that increased surface melting is associated with warming, although atmospheric circulation anomalies, including the summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and variations in snowfall play an important role in driving interannual variations (Section 9.4.1.1; Sasgen et al., 2020; Tedesco and Fettweis, 2020). Further, a coupled ice-sheet-climate model study found emergence of decreased surface mass balance prior to the present day in coastal locations in Greenland, which dominate the integrated surface mass balance (Fyke et al., 2014), suggesting that observed variations in surface mass balance in these regions might be expected to be distinguishable from internal variability. A CMIP6 simulation of the historical period showed stable Greenland surface mass balance up to the 1990s, after which it declined due to increased melt and runoff, consistent with a downscaled reanalysis (van Kampenhout et al., 2020). Further, all experts surveyed in a structured expert judgement exercise examining the causes of the increase in mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet over the last two decades (Bamber et al., 2019) concluded that external forcing was responsible for at least 50% of the mass loss. A comparison of Greenland Ice Sheet mass loss trends from observations and AR5 model projections for the period 2007â€“2017 found that the magnitude of the observed surface mass balance trends was at the top of the AR5 assessed range, while mass loss due to changing ice dynamics was near the centre of the AR5 range (Slater et al., 2020), providing further evidence of consistent anthropogenically-forced mass loss trends in models and observations.Drawing together the evidence from the continued and strengthened observed mass loss, the agreement between anthropogenically forced climate simulations and observations, and historical and paleo evidence for the unusualness of the observed rate of surface melting and mass loss, we assess that it is very likely  that human influence has contributed to the observed surface melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet over the past two decades, and that there is medium confidence in an anthropogenic contribution to recent overall mass loss from Greenland.
