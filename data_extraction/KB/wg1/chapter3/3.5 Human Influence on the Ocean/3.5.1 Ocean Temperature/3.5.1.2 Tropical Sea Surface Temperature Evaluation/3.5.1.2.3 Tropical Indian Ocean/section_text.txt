The tropical Indian Ocean mean state is reasonably well simulated both in CMIP5 and CMIP6 (Figure 3.24b,c). However, CMIP5 models show a large spread in the thermocline depth, particularly in the equatorial part of the basin (Saji et al., 2006; Fathrio et al., 2017b), which has been linked to the parameterization of the vertical mixing and the wind structure, leading to a misrepresentation of the ventilation process in some models (Schott et al., 2009; Richter, 2015; Shikha and Valsala, 2018). A common problem with the CMIP5 models is therefore a warm bias in the subsurface, mainly at depths around the thermocline, which is also apparent in the CMIP6 models (Figure 3.25g).In the CMIP6 multi-model mean, the western tropical Indian Ocean shows a slightly larger warm bias compared to CMIP5 (Figure 3.24 b,c), which in part could be related to excessive supply of warm water from the Red Sea (Grose et al., 2020; Semmler et al., 2020). The HighResMIP models show decreases in SST bias across the Indian Ocean with increasing resolution (Figure 3.3e; Bock et al., 2020), though as a group the SST biases in the HighResMIP models are no smaller than those of the full CMIP6 ensemble.
