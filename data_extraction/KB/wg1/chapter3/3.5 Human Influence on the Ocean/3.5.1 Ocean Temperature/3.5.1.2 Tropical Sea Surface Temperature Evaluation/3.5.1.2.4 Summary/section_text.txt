In summary, the structure and magnitude of multi-model mean ocean temperature biases have not changed substantially between CMIP5 and CMIP6 (medium confidence). Although biases remain in the latest generation models, the broad consistency between the observed and simulated basin-scale ocean properties suggests that CMIP5 and CMIP6 models are appropriate tools for investigating ocean temperature and ocean heat content responses to forcing. This also provides  high confidence in the utility of CMIP-class models for detection and attribution studies, for both ocean heat content (Section 3.5.1.3) and thermosteric sea level applications (Section 3.5.3.2).
