It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land since pre-industrial times. Combining the evidence from across the climate system increases the level of confidence in the attribution of observed climate change to human influence and reduces the uncertainties associated with assessments based on single variables. Large-scale indicators of climate change in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and at the land surface show clear responses to human influence consistent with those expected based on model simulations and physical understanding. {3.8.1}For most large-scale indicators of climate change, the simulated recent mean climate from the latest generation Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate models underpinning this assessment has improved compared to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models assessed in AR5  (high confidence).  Some differences from observations remain, for example in regional precipitation patterns. High-resolution models exhibit reduced biases in some but not all aspects of surface and ocean climate (medium confidence), and most Earth system models, which include biogeochemical feedbacks, perform as well as their lower-complexity counterparts (medium confidence). The multi-model mean captures most aspects of observed climate change well (high confidence). The multi-model mean captures the proxy-reconstructed global-mean surface air temperature (GSAT) change during past high- and low-CO2 climates (high confidence) and the correct sign of temperature and precipitation change in most assessed regions in the mid-Holocene (medium confidence). The simulation of paleoclimates on continental scales has improved compared to AR5 (medium confidence), but models often underestimate large temperature and precipitation differences relative to the present day (high confidence). {3.8.2}
