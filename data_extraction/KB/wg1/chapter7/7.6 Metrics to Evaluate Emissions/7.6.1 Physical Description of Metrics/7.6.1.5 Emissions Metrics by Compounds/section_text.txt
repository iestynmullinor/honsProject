Emissions metrics for selected compounds are presented in Table 7.15, with further compounds presented in the Supplementary Material, Table 7.SM.7. The evolution of the CO2 concentrations in response to a pulse emission is as in AR5 (Joos et al., 2013; Myhre et al., 2013b), the perturbation lifetimes for CH4 and N2O are from (Section 7.6.1.1. The lifetimes and radiative efficiencies for halogenated compounds are taken from Hodnebrog et al. (2020a) . Combined metrics (CGTPs) are presented for compounds with lifetimes less than 20 years. Note that CGTP has units of years and is applied to a change in emissions rate rather than a change in emissions amount. Changes since AR5 are due to changes in radiative properties and lifetimes (Section 7.6.1.1), and indirect contributions (Section 7.6.1.3). Table 7.15 also gives overall emissions uncertainties in the emissions metrics due to uncertainties in radiative efficiencies, lifetimes and the climate response function (Supplementary Material, Tables 7.SM.8 to 7.SM.13).Following their introduction in AR5 the assessed metrics now routinely include the carbon cycle response for non-CO2 gases (Section 7.6.1.3). As assessed in this earlier section, the carbon cycle contribution is lower than in AR5. Contributions to CO2 formation are included for methane depending on whether or not the source originates from fossil carbon, thus methane from fossil fuel sources has slightly higher emissions metric values than that from non-fossil sources.
