This box assesses the present knowledge of the global energy budget for the period 1971–2018, that is, the balance between radiative forcing, the climate system radiative response and observations of the changes in the global energy inventory (Box 7.2, Figure 1a,d).The net effective radiative forcing (ERF) of the Earth system since 1971 has been positive (Section 7.3 and Box 7.2, Figure 1b,e), mainly as a result of increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Sections 2.2.8 and 7.3.2). The ERF of these positive forcing agents have been partly offset by that of negative forcing agents, primarily due to anthropogenic aerosols (Section 7.3.3), which dominate the overall uncertainty. The net energy inflow to the Earth system from ERF for the period 1971–2018 is estimated to be 937 ZJ (1 ZJ = 1021J) with a likely range of 644 to 1259 ZJ (Box 7.2, Figure 1b).Box 7.2The ERF-induced heating of the climate system results in increased thermal radiation to space via the Planck response, but the picture is complicated by a variety of climate feedbacks (Section 7.4.2 and Box 7.1) that also influence the climate system radiative response (Box 7.2, Figure 1c). The total radiative response is estimated by multiplying the assessed net feedback parameter,  α , from process-based evidence (Section 7.4.2 and Table 7.10) with the observed GSAT change for the period (Cross Chapter Box 2.3) and time-integrating (Box 7.2, Figure 1c). The net energy outflow from the Earth system associated with the integrated radiative response for the period 1971–2018 is estimated to be 621 ZJ with a likely range of 419 to 823 ZJ. Assuming a pattern effect (Section 7.4.4) on α of –0.5 W m–2°C–1 would lead to a systematically larger energy outflow by about 250 ZJ.Box 7.2, Figure 1 | Estimates of the net cumulative energy change (ZJ = 1021Joules) for the period 1971–2018 associated with: (a) observations of changes in the global energy inventory; (b) integrated radiative forcing; and (c) integrated radiative response. Black dotted lines indicate the central estimate with likely  and very likely ranges as indicated in the legend. The grey dotted lines indicate the energy change associated with an estimated pre-industrial Earth energy imbalance of 0.2 W m–2(a), and an illustration of an assumed pattern effect of –0.5 W m–2°C–1(c). Background grey lines indicate equivalent heating rates in W m–2 per unit area of Earth’s surface. Panels (d)  and  (e)  show the breakdown of components, as indicated in the legend, for the global energy inventory and integrated radiative forcing, respectively. Panel (f)  shows the global energy budget assessed for the period 1971–2018, that is, the consistency between the change in the global energy inventory relative to pre-industrial and the implied energy change from integrated radiative forcing plus integrated radiative response under a number of different assumptions, as indicated in the legend, including assumptions of correlated and uncorrelated uncertainties in forcing plus response. Shading represents the very likely range for observed energy change relative to pre-industrial levels and likely range for all other quantities. Forcing and response time series are expressed relative to a baseline period of 1850–1900. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 7.SM.14).Open figureCombining the likely range of integrated radiative forcing (Box 7.2, Figure 1b) with the central estimate of integrated radiative response (Box 7.2, Figure 1c) gives a central estimate and likely range of 340 [47 to 662] ZJ (Box 7.2, Figure 1f). Combining the likely range of integrated radiative response with the central estimate of integrated radiative forcing gives a likely range of 340 [147 to 527] ZJ (Box 7.2, Figure 1f). Both calculations yield an implied energy gain in the climate system that is consistent with an independent observation-based assessment of the increase in the global energy inventory expressed relative to the estimated 1850–1900 Earth energy imbalance (Section 7.5.2 and Box 7.2, Figure 1a) with a central estimate and very likely range of 284 [96 to 471] ZJ (high confidence) (Box 7.2, Figure 1d; Table 7.1). Estimating the total uncertainty associated with radiative forcing and radiative response remains a scientific challenge and depends on the degree of correlation between the two (Box 7.2, Figure 1f). However, the central estimate of observed energy change falls well with the estimated likely range, assuming either correlated or uncorrelated uncertainties. Furthermore, the energy budget assessment would accommodate a substantial pattern effect (Section 7.4.4.3) during 1971–2018 associated with systematically larger values of radiative response (Box 7.2, Figure 1c), and potentially improved closure of the global energy budget. For the period 1970–2011, AR5 reported that the global energy budget was closed within uncertainties (high confidence) and consistent with the likely range of assessed climate sensitivity (Church et al., 2013). This Report provides a more robust quantitative assessment based on additional evidence and improved scientific understanding.In addition to new and extended observations (Section 7.2.2), confidence in the observed accumulation of energy in the Earth system is strengthened by cross-validation of heating rates based on satellite and in situ observations (Section 7.2.2.1) and closure of the global sea level budget using consistent datasets (Cross-Chapter Box 9.1 and Table 9.5). Overall, there is  high confidence that the global energy budget is closed for 1971–2018 with improved consistency compared to AR5.
