Due to their low computational cost they can populate or span wide uncertainty ranges that ESMs cannot. They need to be calibrated to do this and, once calibrated, they can aid inter-ESM comparisons and act as ESM extrapolation tools to reflect and combine knowledge from ESMs and many other lines of evidence (Geoffroy et al., 2013a; Good et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2018a). In AR6, the term ‘climate model emulator’ (or simply ‘emulator’) is preferred over ‘simple’ or ‘reduced-complexity climate model’ to reinforce their use as specifically calibrated tools (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, Figure 1). Nonetheless, simple physically based climate models have a long history of use in previous IPCC reports (Section 1.5.3.4). Climate model emulators can include carbon and other gas cycles and can combine uncertainties along the cause–effect chain, from emissions to temperature response. AR5 (M. Collins et al., 2013) used the MAGICC6 emulator (Meinshausen et al., 2011a) in a probabilistic setup (Meinshausen et al., 2009) to explore the uncertainty in future projections. A simple impulse response emulator (Good et al., 2011) was also used to ensure a consistent set of ESM projections could be shown across a range of scenarios. Chapter 8 in AR5 WGI (Myhre et al., 2013b) employed a two-layer emulator for quantifying global temperature-change potentials (GTP). In AR5 WGIII (Clarke et al., 2014), MAGICC6 was also used for the classification of scenarios, and in AR5 Synthesis Report (IPCC, 2014) this information was used to estimate carbon budgets. In SR1.5, two emulators were used to provide temperature projections of scenarios: the MAGICC6 model, which was used for the scenario classification, and the FaIR1.3 model (Millar et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2018a).

For context, a range of CMIP6 ESM results are also shown (thin lines in (c) and open circles in (d)). Panel (b) adapted from Nicholls et al. (2020). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 7.SM.14). Open figureThe SR1.5 found that the physically based emulators produced different projected non-CO2 forcing and identified the largely unexplained differences between the two emulators used as a key knowledge gap (Forster et al., 2018). This led to a renewed effort to test the skill of various emulators. The Reduced Complexity Model Intercomparison Project (RCMIP; Nicholls et al., 2020) found that the latest generation of the emulators can reproduce key characteristics of the observed changes in global surface air temperature (GSAT) together with other key responses of ESMs (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, Figure 1a). In particular, despite their reduced structural complexity, some emulators are able to replicate the non-linear aspects of ESM GSAT response over a range of scenarios. GSAT emulation has been more thoroughly explored in the literature than other types of emulation. Structural differences between emulation approaches lead to different outcomes and there are problems with emulating particular ESMs. In conclusion, there is medium confidence that emulators calibrated to single ESM runs can reproduce ESM projections of the forced GSAT response to other similar emissions scenarios to within natural variability (Meinshausen et al., 2011b; Geoffroy et al., 2013a; Dorheim et al., 2020; Nicholls et al., 2020; Tsutsui, 2020), although larger differences can remain for scenarios with very different forcing characteristics. For variables other than GSAT there has not yet been a comprehensive effort to evaluate the performance of emulators.Application of emulators in AR6 WGICross-Chapter Box 7.1 Table 1 shows the use of emulators within the WGI Report. The main use of emulation in the Report is to estimate GSAT change from effective radiative forcing (ERF) or concentration changes, where various versions of a two-layer energy budget emulator are used. The two-layer emulator is equivalent to a two-timescale impulse-response model (Supplementary Material 7.SM.2; Geoffroy et al., 2013b). Both a single configuration version and probabilistic forms are used. The emulator is an extension of the energy budget equation (Box 7.1, Equation 7.1) and allows for heat exchange between the upper- and deep-ocean layers, mimicking the ocean heat uptake that reduces the rate of surface warming under radiative forcing (Gregory, 2000; Held et al., 2010; Winton et al., 2010; Armour, 2017; Mauritsen and Pincus, 2017; Rohrschneider et al., 2019). Although the same energy budget emulator approach is used, different calibrations are employed in various sections, to serve different purposes and keep lines of evidence as independent as possible. Chapter 9 additionally employs projections of ocean heat content from the (Chapter 7 two-layer emulator to estimate the thermostatic component of future sea level rise (Section 9.6.3 and Supplementary Material 7.SM.2).

Assessed literature includes projections with a regional pattern scaling and variability emulator.Various regional informationEmissions-driven emulators (as opposed to ERF-driven or concentration-driven emulators) are also used in the Report. In (Chapter 4 Section 4.6) MAGICC7 is used to emulate GSAT beyond 2100 since its long-term response has been assessed to be fit-for-purpose to represent the behaviour of ESMs. In (Chapter 5 Section 5.5) MAGICC7 is used to explore the non-CO2 GSAT contribution in emissions scenarios. In (Chapter 6 and (Chapter 7 Section 7.6), two-layer model configurations are tuned to match the probabilistic GSAT responses of FaIRv1.6.2 and MAGICC7 emissions-driven emulators. For (Chapter 6 the two median values from FaIRv1.6.2 and MAGICC7 emulators are averaged and then matched to the best-estimate ECS of 3°C and TCR of 1.8°C (Tables 7.13 and 7.14) under the best-estimate ERF due to a doubling of CO2 of 3.93 W m–2(Table 7.4). For (Section 7.6 a distribution of responses is used from the two emulators to estimate uncertainties in global temperature change potentials (GTP).Emissions-driven emulators for scenario classification in AR6 WGIIIAs in AR5 and SR1.5, emissions-driven emulators are used to communicate outcomes of the physical climate science assessment and uncertainties to quantify the temperature outcome associated with different emissions scenarios. In particular, the computational efficiency of these emulators allows the analysis of a large number of multi-gas emissions scenarios in terms of multiple characteristics, e.g., year of peak temperature or 2030 emissions levels, in line with keeping global warming to below 1.5°C or 2.0°C.Four emissions-driven emulators have been considered as tools for WGIII to explore the range of GSAT response to multiple scenarios beyond those assessed in WGI. The four emulators are CICERO-SCM (Skeie et al., 2017, 2021), FaIRv1.6.2 (Millar et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2018a), MAGICC7 (Meinshausen et al., 2009) and OSCARv3.1.1 (Gasser et al., 2017a, 2020). Each emulator’s probabilistic distribution has been calibrated to capture the relationship between emissions and GSAT change. The calibration is informed by the WGI assessed ranges of ECS, TCR, historical GSAT change, ERF, carbon cycle metrics and future warming projections under the (concentration-driven) SSP scenarios. The emulators are then provided as a tool for WGIII to perform a GSAT-based classification of mitigation scenarios consistent with the physical understanding assessed in WGI. The calibration step reduced the emulator differences identified in SR1.5. Note that evaluation of both central and range estimates of each emulator’s probabilistic projections is important to assess the fitness-for-purpose for the classification of scenarios in WGIII, based on information beyond the central estimate of GSAT warming.MAGICC7 and FaIRv1.6.2 emissions-based emulators are able to represent the WGI assessment to within small differences (defined here as within typical rounding precisions of ±5% for central estimates and ±10% for ranges) across more than 80% of metric ranges (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, Table 2). Both calibrated emulators are consistent with assessed ranges of ECS, historical GSAT, historical ocean heat uptake, total greenhouse gas ERF, methane ERF and the majority of the assessed SSP warming ranges. FaIRv1.6.2 also matches the assessed central value of TCRE and airborne fraction. Whereas, MAGICC7 matches the assessed TCR ranges as well as providing a closer fit to the SSP warming ranges for the lower-emissions scenarios. In the evaluation framework considered here, CICERO-SCM represents historical warming to within 2% of the assessed ranges and also represents future temperature ranges across the majority of the assessment, although it lacks the representation of the carbon cycle. In this framework, OSCARv3.1.1 is less able to represent the assessed projected GSAT ranges although it matches the range of airborne fraction estimates closely and the assessed historical GSATlikely range to within 0.5%. Despite these identified limitations, both CICERO-SCM and OSCARv3.1.1 provide additional information for evaluating the sensitivity of scenario classification to model choice.How emulators match the assessed ranges used for the evaluation framework is summarized here and in Table 2. The first is too-low projections for 2081–2100 under SSP1-1.9 (8% or 15% too low for the central estimate and 15% or 25% too low for the lower end in the case of MAGICC7 or FaIRv1.6.2, respectively). The second is the representation of the aerosol ERF (both MAGICC7 and FaIRv1.6.2 are greater than 8% less negative than the central assessed range and greater than 10% less negative for the lower assessed range), as energy balance models struggle to reproduce an aerosol ERF with a magnitude as strong as the assessed best estimate and still match historical warming estimates. Both emulators have medium to large differences compared to the TCRE and airborne fraction ranges (see notes beneath Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, Table 2). Finally, there is also a slight overestimate of the low end of the assessed historical GSAT range.Overall, there is  high confidence that emulated historical and future ranges of GSAT change can be calibrated to be internally consistent with the assessment of key physical-climate indicators in this Report: greenhouse gas ERFs, ECS and TCR. When calibrated to match the assessed ranges of GSAT and multiple physical climate indicators, physically based emulators can reproduce the best estimate of GSAT change over 1850–1900 to 1995–2014 to within 5% and the very likely range of this GSAT change to within 10%. MAGICC7 and FaIRv1.6.2 match at least two-thirds of the (Chapter 4 assessed projected GSAT changes to within these levels of precision.

Metrics calibrated against are equilibrium climate sensitivity, ECs (Section 7.5); transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions, TCRe (Section 5.5); transient climate response, TCr (Section 7.5), historical GSAT change (Section 2.3); ocean heat uptake (Sections 7.2 and 2.3); effective radiative forcing, ERf (Section 7.3); carbon cycle metrics, namely airborne fractions of idealized CO2 scenarios (taking the likely range as twice the standard deviation across the models analysed in Arora et al.

See Supplementary Material, Table 7.SM.4 for a version of this table with the absolute values rather than percentage differences. The columns labelled ‘upper’ and ‘lower’ indicate 5–95% ranges, except for the variables demarcated with an asterisk or double asterisk (* or **), where they denote likely ranges from 17–83%. Note that the TCRE assessed range (**) is wider than the combination of the TCR and airborne fraction to account for uncertainties related to model limitations (Table 5.7) hence it is expected that the emulators are too narrow on this particular metric and/or too wide on TCR and airborne fraction. For illustrative purposes, the cells are coloured as follows: white cells indicate small differences (up to ±5% for the central value and +10% for the ranges), light blue and light yellow cells indicate medium differences (up to +10% and –10% for light blue and light yellow for central values, respectively; up to ±20% for the ranges) and darker cells indicate larger positive (blue) or negative (yellow) differences. Note that values are rounded after the colours are applied.
