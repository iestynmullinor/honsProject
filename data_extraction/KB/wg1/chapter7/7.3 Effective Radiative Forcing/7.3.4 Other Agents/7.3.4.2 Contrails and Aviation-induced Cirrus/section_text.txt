ERF from contrails and aviation-induced cirrus is taken from the assessment of Lee et al. (2020), at 0.057 [0.019 to 0.098] W m–2 in 2018 (see Section 6.6.2 for an assessment of the total effects of aviation). This is rounded up to address its low confidence and the extra year of air traffic to give an assessed ERF over 1750–2019 of 0.06 [0.02 to 0.10] W m–2. This assessment is given low confidence due to the potential that processes missing from the assessment would affect the magnitude of contrails and aviation-induced cirrus ERF.
