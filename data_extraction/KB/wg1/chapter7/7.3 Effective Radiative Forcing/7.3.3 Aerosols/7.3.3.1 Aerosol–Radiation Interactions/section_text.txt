The observation-based assessment of IRFari of –0.4 ± 0.4 W m–2 and the corresponding model-based assessment of –0.2 ± 0.2 W m–2 can be compared to the range of –0.45 to –0.05 W m–2 that emerged from a comprehensive review in which an observation-based estimate of anthropogenic AOD was combined with model-derived ranges for all relevant aerosol radiative properties (Bellouin et al., 2020). Based on the above, IRFari is assessed to be –0.25 ± 0.2 W m–2(medium confidence).ERFari from model-based evidence is –0.25 ± 0.25 W m–2, which suggests a small negative adjustment relative to the model-based IRFari estimate, consistent with the literature discussed in (Section 7.3.3.1.2. Adding this small adjustment to our assessed IRFari estimate of –0.25 W m–2, and accounting for additional uncertainty in the adjustments, ERFari is assessed to –0.3 ± 0.3 (medium confidence). This assessment is consistent with the 5–95% confidence range for ERFari in Bellouin et al. (2020) of –0.71 to –0.14 W m–2, and notably implies that it is very likely  that ERFari is negative. Differences relative to Bellouin et al. (2020) reflect the range of estimates in Table 7.6 and the fact that an ERFari more negative than –0.6 W m–2 would require adjustments that considerably augment the assessed IRFari, which is not supported by the assessed literature.Table 7.6 | Present-day effective radiative forcing (ERF) due to changes in aerosol–radiation interactions (ERFari) and changes in aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci), and total aerosol ERF (ERFari+aci)  from GCM CMIP6 (2014 relative to 1850; Smith et al., 2020b and later model results) and CMIP5 (year 2000 relative to 1860; Zelinka et al., 2014). CMIP6 results are simulated as part of RFMIP (Pincus et al., 2016). An additional 5% is applied to the CMIP5 and CMIP6 model results to account for land-surface cooling (Figure 7.4; Smith et al., 2020a).
