The estimated contribution of forcing agents to the 2019 global surface air temperature (GSAT) change relative to 1750 is shown in Figure 7.7. These estimates were produced using the concentration-derived ERF time series presented in Figure 2.10 and described in Supplementary Material 7.SM.1.3. The resulting GSAT changes over time are shown in Figure 7.8. The historical time series of ERFs for the WMGHGs can be derived by applying the ERF calculations of Section 7.3.2 to the observed time series of WMGHG concentrations in Chapter 2 Section 2.2.Figure 7.7  | The contribution of forcing agents to 2019 temperature change relative to 1750 produced using the two-layer emulator (Supplementary Material 7.SM.2), constrained to assessed ranges for key climate metrics described in Cross-Chapter Box 7.1.  The results are from a 2237-member ensemble. Temperature contributions are expressed for carbon dioxide, other well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs), ozone, stratospheric water vapour, surface albedo, contrails and aviation-induced cirrus, aerosols, solar, volcanic, and total. Solid bars represent best estimates, and very likely  (5–95%) ranges are given by error bars. Dashed error bars show the contribution of forcing uncertainty alone, using best estimates of ECS (3.0°C), TCR (1.8°C) and two-layer model parameters representing the CMIP6 multi-model mean. Solid error bars show the combined effects of forcing and climate response uncertainty using the distribution of ECS and TCR from Tables 7.13 and 7.14, and the distribution of calibrated model parameters from 44 CMIP6 models. Non-CO2WMGHGs are further broken down into contributions from methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and halogenated compounds. Surface albedo is broken down into land-use changes and light-absorbing particles on snow and ice. Aerosols are broken down into contributions from aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) and aerosol–radiation interactions (ERFari). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 7.SM.14). Open figureThese ERF timeseries are combined with a two-layer emulator (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 and Supplementary Material 7.SM.2) using a 2237-member constrained Monte Carlo sample of both forcing uncertainty (by sampling ERF ranges) and climate response (by sampling ECS, TCR and ocean heat capacity ranges). The net model warming over the historical period is matched to the assessment of historical GSAT warming from 1850–1900 to 1995–2014 of 0.85 [0.67 to 0.98] °C (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3) and ocean heat content change from 1971 to 2018 Section 7.2.2.2). Therefore the model gives the breakdown of the GSAT trend associated with different forcing mechanisms that are consistent with the overall GSAT change. The model assumes that there is no variation in feedback parameter across forcing mechanisms (Section 7.3.1) and variations in the effective feedback parameter over the historical record (Section 7.4.4). The distribution of ECS was informed bySection 7.5.5 and chosen to approximately maintain the best estimate and likely /very likely ranges assessed in that section (see also Supplementary Material 7.SM.2). The TCR has an ensemble median value of 1.81°C, in good agreement with (Section 7.5.5. Two error bars are shown in Figure 7.7. The dashed error bar shows the contribution of ERF uncertainty (as assessed in the subsections of (Section 7.3) employing the best estimate of climate response with an ECS of 3.0°C. The solid bar is the total response uncertainty using the (Section 7.5.5 assessment of ECS. The uncertainty in the historical temperature contributions ofthe different forcing agents is mostly due to uncertainties in ERF, yet for the WMGHG the uncertainty is dominated by the climate response as its ERF is relatively well known (Figure 7.7). From the assessment of emulator responses in Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, there is  high confidence that calibrated emulators such as the one employed here can represent the historical GSAT change between 1850–1900 and 1995–2014 to within 5% for the best estimate and 10% for the very likely range (Supplementary Material, Table 7.SM.4). This gives  high confidence in the overall assessment of GSAT change for the response to ERFs over 1750–2019 derived from the emulator.The total human forced GSAT change from 1750 to 2019 is calculated to be 1.29 [1.00 to 1.65] °C (high confidence). Although the total emulated GSAT change has  high confidence, the confidence of the individual contributions matches those given for the ERF assessment in the subsections of (Section 7.3. The calculated GSAT change is comprised of a WMGHG warming of 1.58 [1.17 to 2.17] °C (high confidence), a warming from ozone changes of 0.23 [0.11 to 0.39] °C (high confidence), and a cooling of –0.50 [–0.22 to –0.96] °C from aerosol effects (medium confidence). The aerosol cooling has considerable regional time dependence (Section 6.4.3) but has weakened slightly over the last 20 years in the global mean (Figures 2.10 and 7.8). There is also a –0.06 [–0.15 to +0.01] °C contribution from surface reflectance changes which is dominated by land-use change (medium confidence). Changes in solar and volcanic activity are assessed to have together contributed a small change of –0.02 [–0.06 to +0.02] °C since 1750 (medium confidence).The total (anthropogenic + natural) emulated GSAT between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019 is 1.14 [0.89 to 1.45] °C, compared to the assessed GSAT of 1.06 [0.88 to 1.21] °c (Section 2.3.1 and Cross Chapter Box 2.3). The emulated response is slightly warmer than the observations and has a larger uncertainty range. As the emulated response attempts to constrain to multiple lines of evidence (Supplementary Material 7.SM.2), only one of which is GSAT, they should not necessarily be expected to exactly agree. The larger uncertainty range in the emulated GSAT compared to the observations is reflective of the uncertainties in ECS, TCR and ERF (particularly the aerosol ERF) that drive the emulator response.The emulator gives a range of GSAT response for the period 1750 to 1850–1900 of 0.09 [0.04 to 0.14] °C from anthropogenic ERFs. These results are used as a line of evidence for the assessment of this change in (Chapter 1 (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2), which gives an overall assessment of 0.1°C [likely range –0.1 to +0.3] °C.Figure 7.8 presents the GSAT time series using ERF time series for individual forcing agents rather than their aggregation. It shows that for most of the historical period the long time scale total GSAT trend estimate from the emulator closely follows the CO2 contribution. The GSAT estimate from non-CO2 greenhouse gas forcing (from other WMGHGs and ozone) has been approximately cancelled out in the global average by a cooling GSAT trend from aerosols. However, since 1980 the aerosol cooling trend has stabilized and may have started to reverse, so that over the last few decades the long-term warming has been occurring at a faster rate than would be expected due to CO2 alone (high confidence) (see also Sections 2.2.6 and 2.2.8). Throughout the record, but especially prior to 1930, periods of volcanic cooling dominate decadal variability. These estimates of the forced response are compared with model simulations and attributable warming estimates in (Chapter 3 Section 3.3.1).Figure 7.8  | Attributed global surface air temperature change (GSAT) from 1750 to 2019 produced using the two-layer emulator (Supplementary Material 7.SM.2), forced with ERF derived in this chapter (displayed in Figure 2.10) and climate response constrained to assessed ranges for key climate metrics described in Cross-Chapter Box 7.1.  The results shown are the medians from a 2237-member ensemble that encompasses uncertainty in forcing and climate response (year-2019 best estimates and uncertainties are shown in Figure 7.7 for several components). Temperature contributions are expressed for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), other well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs), ozone (O3), aerosols, and other anthropogenic forcings, as well as total anthropogenic, solar, volcanic, and total forcing.
