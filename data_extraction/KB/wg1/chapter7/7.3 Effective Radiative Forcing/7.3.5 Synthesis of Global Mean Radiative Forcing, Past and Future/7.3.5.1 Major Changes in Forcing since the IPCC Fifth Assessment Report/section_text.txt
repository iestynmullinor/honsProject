The AR5 introduced the concept of effective radiative forcing (ERF) and radiative adjustments, and made a preliminary assessment that the tropospheric adjustments were zero for all species other than the effects of aerosol–cloud interaction and black carbon. Since AR5, new studies have allowed for a tentative assessment of values for tropospheric adjustments to CO2, CH4, N2O, some CFCs, solar forcing, and stratospheric aerosols, and to place a tighter constraint on adjustments from aerosol–cloud interaction (Sections 7.3.2, 7.3.3 and 7.3.4). In AR6, the definition of ERF explicitly removes the land-surface temperature change as part of the forcing, in contrast to AR5 where only sea surface temperatures were fixed. The ERF is assessed to be a better predictor of modelled equilibrium temperature change (i.e., less variation in feedback parameter) than SARf (Section 7.3.1).As discussed in (Section 7.3.2, the radiative efficiencies for CO2, CH4 and N2O have been updated since AR5 (Etminan et al., 2016). There has been a small (1%) increase in the stratospheric-temperature-adjusted CO2 radiative efficiency, and a +5% tropospheric adjustment has been added. The stratospheric-temperature-adjusted radiative efficiency for CH4 is increased by approximately 25% (high confidence). The tropospheric adjustment is tentatively assessed to be –14% (low confidence). A +7% tropospheric adjustment has been added to the radiative efficiency for N2O and +12% to CFC-11 and CFC-12 (low confidence).For aerosols there has been a convergence of model and observational estimates of aerosol forcing, and the partitioning of the total aerosol ERF has changed. Compared to AR5 a greater fraction of the ERF is assessed to come from ERFaci compared to the ERFari. It is now assessed as virtually certain that the total aerosol ERF (ERFari+aci) is negative.
