Figure 7.6 shows the industrial-era ERF estimates for 1750 to 2019 for the concentration change in different forcing agents. The assessed uncertainty distributions for each individual component are combined with a 100,000-member Monte Carlo simulation that samples the different distributions, assuming they are independent, to obtain the overall assessment of total present-day ERF (Supplementary Material 7.SM.1). The corresponding emissions-based ERF figure is shown in (Chapter 6 (Figure 6.12).Figure 7.6  | Change in effective radiative forcing (ERF) from 1750 to 2019 by contributing forcing agents (carbon dioxide, other well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs), ozone, stratospheric water vapour, surface albedo, contrails and aviation-induced cirrus, aerosols, anthropogenic total, and solar).  Solid bars represent best estimates, and very likely  (5–95%) ranges are given by error bars. Non-CO2 WMGHGs are further broken down into contributions from methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and halogenated compounds. Surface albedo is broken down into land-use changes and light-absorbing particles on snow and ice. Aerosols are broken down into contributions from aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) and aerosol–radiation interactions (ERFari). For aerosols and solar, the 2019 single-year values are given (Table 7.8), which differ from the headline assessments in both cases. Volcanic forcing is not shown due to the episodic nature of volcanic eruptions. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 7.SM.14). Open figureThe total anthropogenic ERF over the industrial era (1750–2019) is estimated as 2.72 [1.96 to 3.48] W m–2(high confidence) (Table 7.8 and Annex III). This represents a 0.43 W m–2 increase over the assessment made in AR5 (Myhre et al., 2013b) for the period 1750–2011. This increase is a result of compensating effects. Atmospheric concentration increases of GHGs since 2011 and upwards revisions of their forcing estimates have led to a 0.59 W m–2 increase in their ERF. However, the total aerosol ERF is assessed to be more negative compared to AR5, due to revised estimates rather than trends (high confidence). Table 7.8 | Summary table of effective radiative forcing (ERF) estimates for AR6 and comparison with the four previous IPCC assessment reports. Prior to AR5 values are stratospheric-temperature-adjusted radiative forcing (SARF). For AR5 aerosol–radiation interactions (ari) and aerosol–cloud interactions (aci) are ERF; all other values assume ERF equals SARF. Ranges shown are 5–95%. Volcanic ERF is not added to the table due to the episodic nature of volcanic eruptions which makes it difficult to compare to the other forcing mechanisms. Solar ERF is based on total solar irradiance (TSI) and not spectral variation.

Carbon dioxide continues to contribute the largest part (56 ± 16%) of this GHG ERF (high confidence).As discussed in (Section 7.3.3, aerosols have in total contributed an ERF of –1.1 [–1.7 to –0.4] W m–2 over 1750–2019 (medium confidence). Aerosol–cloud interactions contribute approximately 75–80% of this ERF with the remainder due to aerosol–radiation interactions (Table 7.8).For the purpose of comparing forcing changes with historical temperature change (Section 7.5.2), longer averaging periods are useful. The change in ERF from the second half of the 19th century (1850–1900) compared with a recent period (2006–2019) is +2.20 [1.53 to 2.91] W m–2, of which 1.71 [1.51 to 1.92] W m–2 is due to CO2.
