The lines of evidence directly constraining ECS from paleoclimates are summarized in Table 7.11. Although some of the estimates in Table 7.11 are not independent because they use similar proxy records to each other (e.g., von der Heydt et al., 2014; Köhler et al., 2015, 2017; Stap et al., 2019), there are still multiple independent lines of paleoclimate evidence regarding ECS, from differing past time periods: LGM (Sherwood et al., 2020; Tierney et al., 2020b); glacial–interglacial (Royer, 2016; Köhler et al., 2017; Snyder, 2019; Friedrich and Timmermann, 2020); Pliocene (Martínez-Botí et al., 2015; Sherwood et al., 2020); and the Eocene (Anagnostou et al., 2016, 2020; Shaffer et al., 2016; Inglis et al., 2020), with differing proxies for estimating forcing (e.g., CO2 from ice cores or boron isotopes) and response (e.g., global surface temperature fromδ18O, Mg/Ca or AntarcticδD). Furthermore, although different studies have uncertainty estimates that account for differing sources of uncertainty, some studies (Snyder, 2019; Inglis et al., 2020; Sherwood et al., 2020; Tierney et al., 2020b) do consider many of the uncertainties discussed in Sections 7.5.3.1–7.5.3.3. All the studies based on glacial–interglacial cycles account for some aspects of the state-dependence of climate sensitivity (Section 7.4.3) by considering only the warm phases of the Pleistocene, although what constitutes a warm phase is defined differently across the studies.None of the post-AR5 studies in Table 7.11 have an estimated lower range for ECS below 1.6°C. As such, based solely on the paleoclimate record, it is assessed to be very likely  that ECS is greater than 1.5°C (high confidence).In general, it is the studies based on the warm periods of the glacial–interglacial cycles (Section 7.5.3.2) that give the largest values of ECS. Given the large uncertainties associated with estimating the magnitude of the ice-sheet forcing during these intervals (Stap et al., 2019), and other uncertainties discussed in (Section 7.5.3.2, in particular the direct effect of orbital forcing on estimates of ECS, there is onlylow confidence in estimates from the studies based on glacial–interglacial periods. This low confidence also results from the temperature-dependence of the net feedback parameter,  α , resulting from several of these studies (Figure 7.10), that is hard to reconcile with the other lines of evidence for α , including proxy estimates from warmer paleoclimates (Section 7.4.3.2). A central estimate of ECS, derived from the LGm (Section 7.5.3.1) and warm periods of the pre-Quaternary (Section 7.5.3.3), that takes into account some of the interdependencies between the different studies, can be obtained by averaging across studies within each of these two time periods, and then averaging across the two time periods; this results in a central estimate of 3.4°C. This approach of focussing on the LGM and warm climates was also taken by Sherwood et al. (2020) in their assessment of ECS from paleoclimates. An alternative method is to average across all studies, from all periods, that have considered multiple sources of uncertainty (Table 7.11); this approach leads to a similar central estimate of 3.3°C. Overall, we assess medium confidence for a central estimate of 3.3°C to 3.4°C.There is more variation in the upper bounds of ECS than in the lower bounds. Estimates of ECS from pre-Quaternary warm periods have an average upper range of 4.9°C, and from the LGM of 4.4°C; taking into account the independence of the estimates from these two time periods, and accounting for state-dependence (Section 7.4.3) and other uncertainties discussed in (Section 7.5.3, the paleoclimate record on its own indicates that ECS is likely less than 4.5°C. Given the higher values from many glacial–interglacial studies, this value has only medium  confidence. Despite the large variation in individual studies at the extreme upper end, all except two studies (both of which are from glacial–interglacial time periods associated with low confidence) have central estimates that are below 6°C; overall we assess that it is extremely likely  that ECS is below 8°C (high confidence).Table 7.11 | Estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) derived from paleoclimates; from AR5 (above double lines) and from post-AR5 studies (below double lines). Many studies provide an estimate of ECS that includes only CO2 and the ice-sheet feedback as forcings, providing an estimate of S[CO2, LI] using the notation of Rohling et al. (2012), which is equivalent to our definition of ECS (Box 7.1). However, some studies provide estimates of other types of sensitivity (column 4). Different studies (column 1) focus on different time periods (column 2) and use a variety of different paleoclimate proxies and models (column 3) to give a best estimate (column 5) and/or a range (column 5). The published ranges given account for varying sources of uncertainty (column 6). See Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 for definition of time periods. All temperature values in column 5 are shown to a precision of 1 decimal place.
