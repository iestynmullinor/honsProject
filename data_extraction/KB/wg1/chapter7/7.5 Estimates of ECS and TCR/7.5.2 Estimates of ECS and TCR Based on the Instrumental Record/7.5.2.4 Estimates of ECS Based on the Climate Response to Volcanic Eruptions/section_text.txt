A number of studies consider the observed climate response to volcanic eruptions over the 20th century (Section 3.3.1 and Cross-Chapter Box 4.1; Knutti et al., 2017). However, the direct constraint on ECS is weak, particularly at the high end, because the temperature response to short-term forcing depends only weakly on radiative feedbacks and because it can take decades of a sustained forcing before the magnitude of temperature changes reflects differences in ECS across models (Geoffroy et al., 2013b; Merlis et al., 2014). It is also a challenge to separate the response to volcanic eruptions from internal climate variability in the years that follow them (Wigley et al., 2005). Based on ESM simulations, radiative feedbacks governing the global surface temperature response to volcanic eruptions can be substantially different than those governing long-term global warming (Merlis et al., 2014; Marvel et al., 2016; Ceppi and Gregory, 2019). Estimates based on the response to volcanic eruptions agree with other lines of evidence (Knutti et al., 2017), but they do not constitute a direct estimate of ECS (high confidence). The ‘emergent constraints’ on ECS based on climate variability, including volcanic eruptions, are summarized in (Section 7.5.4.1.
