The Planck response represents the additional thermal or longwave (LW) emission to space arising from vertically uniform warming of the surface and the atmosphere. The Planck response α P, often called the Planck feedback, plays a fundamental stabilizing role in Earth’s climate and has a value that is strongly negative: a warmer planet radiates more energy to space. A crude estimate of α Pcan be made using the normalized greenhouse effect g̃, defined as the ratio between the greenhouse effectG and the upwelling LW flux at the surface (Raval and Ramanathan, 1989). Current estimates (Section 7.2, Figure 7.2) give G= 159 W m–2 and g̃≈ 0.4. Assumingg̃ is constant, one obtains for a surface temperature Ts= 288 K,  α P= (g– 1) 4σT3s≈ –3.3 W m–2°C–1, whereσ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. This parameter α P is estimated more accurately using kernels obtained from meteorological reanalysis or climate simulations (Soden and Held, 2006; Dessler, 2013; Vial et al., 2013; Caldwell et al., 2016; Colman and Hanson, 2017; Zelinka et al., 2020). Discrepancies among estimates primarily arise because differences in cloud distributions make the radiative kernels differ (Kramer et al., 2019). Using six different kernels, Zelinka et al. (2020) obtained a spread of ±0.1 W m–2°C–1(one standard deviation). Discrepancies among estimates secondarily arise from differences in the pattern of equilibrium surface temperature changes among ESMs. For the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models this introduces a spread of ±0.04 W m–2°C–1(one standard deviation). The multi-kernel and multi-model mean of α P is equal to –3.20 W m–2°C–1for the CMIP5 and –3.22 W m–2°C–1for the CMIP6 models (Supplementary Material, Table 7.SM.5). Overall, there is  high confidence in the estimate of the Planck response, which is assessed to be α P= –3.22 W m–2°C–1 with avery likely range of –3.4 to –3.0 W m–2°C–1and a likely range of –3.3 to –3.1 W m–2°C–1.The Planck temperature response ΔTP is the equilibrium temperature change in response to a forcing ΔF when the net feedback parameter is equal to the Planck response parameter: ΔTP= –ΔF / α P.
