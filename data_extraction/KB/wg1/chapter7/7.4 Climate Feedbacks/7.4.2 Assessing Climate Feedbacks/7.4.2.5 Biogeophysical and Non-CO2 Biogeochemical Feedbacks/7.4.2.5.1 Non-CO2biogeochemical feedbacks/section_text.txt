The chemical composition of the atmosphere (beyond CO2 and water vapour changes) is expected to change in response to a warming climate. These changes in greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide and ozone) and aerosol amount (including dust) have the potential to alter the TOA energy budget and are collectively referred to as ‘non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks’. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) feedbacks arise partly from changes in their emissions from natural sources in response to temperature change; these are assessed in (Chapter 5 Section 5.4.7; see also Figure 5.29c). Here we exclude the permafrost CH4 feedback (Section 5.4.9.1.2) because, although associated emissions are projected to increase under warming on multi-decadal to centennial time scales, on longer time scales these emissions would eventually substantially decline as the permafrost carbon pools were depleted (Schneider von Deimling et al., 2012, 2015). This leaves the wetland CH4, land N2O, and ocean N2O feedbacks, the assessed mean values of which sum to a positive feedback parameter of +0.04 [0.02 to 0.06] W m–2°C–1Section 5.4.7. Other non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks that are relevant to the net feedback parameter are assessed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.4.5 and Table 6.8). These feedbacks are associated with sea salt, dimethyl sulphide, dust, ozone, biogenic volatile organic compounds, lightning, and CH4 lifetime, and sum to a negative feedback parameter of –0.20 [–0.41 to +0.01] W m–2°C–1. The overall feedback parameter for non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks is obtained by summing the Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 assessments, which gives –0.16 [–0.37 to +0.05] W m–2°C–1. However, there is low confidence in the estimates of both the individual non-CO2 biogeochemical feedbacks as well as their total effect, as evident from the large range in the magnitudes of α from different studies, which can be attributed to diversity in how models account for these feedbacks and limited process-level understanding.
