Williams (United States of America)Over the long evolution of the Earth’s climate system, several periods have been extensively studied as examples of distinct climate states. This Cross-Chapter Box places multiple paleoclimate reference periods into the unifying context of Earth’s long-term climate history, and points to sections in the report with additional information about each period. Other reference periods, including those of the industrialized era, are described in Section 1.4.1.The reference periods represent times that were both colder and warmer than present, and periods of rapid climate change, many with informative parallels to projected climate (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Table 1). They are used to address a wide variety of questions related to natural climate variations in the past (FAQ 1.3). Most of them are used as targets to evaluate the performance of climate models under different climate forcings (Section 3.8.2), while also providing insight into the ocean-atmospheric circulation changes associated with various radiative forcings and geographical changes.Global mean surface temperature (GMST) is a key indicator of the changing state of the climate system. Earth’s mean temperature history during the current geological era (Cenozoic, beginning 66 Ma (66 million years ago)) can be broadly characterized as follows (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1): (i) transient warming during the first 15 Myr (15 million years) of the Cenozoic, punctuated by the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum; (ii) a long-term cooling over tens of millions of years beginning around 50 Ma, driven by (among other factors) the slow drift of tectonic plates, which drove mountain building, erosion and volcanism, and reconfigured ocean passages, all of which ultimately moved carbon from the atmosphere to other reservoirs and led to the development of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) about 35–30 Ma; (iii) the intensification of cooling by climate feedbacks involving interactions among tectonics, ice albedo, ocean circulation, land cover and greenhouse gases, causing ice sheets to develop in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) by about 3 Ma; (iv) glacial-interglacial fluctuations paced by slow changes in Earth’s astronomical configuration (orbital forcing) and modulated by changes in the global carbon cycle and ice sheets on time scales of tens to hundreds of thousands of years, with particular prominence during the last 1 Myr; (v) a transition with both gradual and abrupt shifts from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present interglacial epoch (Holocene), with sporadic ice-sheet breakup disrupting ocean circulation; (vi) continued warming followed by minor cooling following the mid-Holocene, with superposed centennial- to decadal-scale fluctuations caused by volcanic activity, among other factors; (vii) recent warming related to the build-up of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (Sections 2.2.3 and 3.3.1).GMST estimated for each of the reference periods based on proxy evidence (Section 2.3.1.1) can be compared with climate projections over coming centuries to place the range of possible futures into a longer-term context (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1). Here, the very likely range of GMST for the warmer world reference periods are compared with the very likely range of GSAT projected for the end the 21st century (2080–2100; Table 4.5) and the likely range for the end of the 23rd century (2300; Table 4.9) under multiple Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. From this comparison, there is medium confidence in the following: GMST estimated for the warmest long-term period of the Last Interglacial about 125 ka (125,000 years ago; 0.5°C–1.5°C relative to 1850–1900) overlaps with the low end of the range of temperatures projected under SSP1-2.6 including its negative emissions extension to the end of the 23rd century (1.0°Cto 2.2°C). GMST estimated for a period of prolonged warmth during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period about 3 Ma [2.5°C to 4.0°C] is similar to temperatures projected under SSP2-4.5 for the end of the 23rd century (2.3°C to 4.6°C). GMST estimated for the Miocene Climatic Optimum [5°C to 10°C] and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum [10°C to 18°C], about 15 and 50 Ma, respectively, overlap with the range projected for the end of the 23rd century under SSP5-8.5 (6.6°C to 14.1°C).

AR6 Sections(partial list) Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM)55.9–55.7 Ma (million years ago)A geologically rapid, large-magnitude warming event at the start of the Eocene when a large pulse of carbon was released to the ocean-atmosphere system, decreasing ocean pH and oxygen content. Terrestrial plant and animal communities changed composition, and species distributions shifted poleward. Many deep-sea species went extinct and tropical coral reefs diminished.

Continental positions were somewhat different to present due to tectonic plate movements; polar ice was absent and there was more warming at high latitudes than in the equatorial regions. Near-tropical forests grew at 70°S, despite seasonal polar darkness.

Continental geography was broadly similar to modern. At times, Arctic sea ice may have been absent, and the AIS was much smaller or perhaps absent. Peak in Cenozoic reef development. MioMIP1, Early and Middle Miocene (Steinthorsdottir et al., 2021)2.2.3.12.3.1.1.1Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP)3.3–3.0 MaWarm period when atmospheric CO2 concentration was similar to present (Cross-Chapter Box 2.4). The Arctic was much warmer, but tropical temperatures were only slightly warmer. Sea level was higher than present. Treeline extended to the northern coastline of the NH continents.

Northern high latitudes were warmer, with reduced sea ice. Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets were smaller and sea level was higher. Monsoon was enhanced. Boreal forests extended into Greenland and subtropical animals such as Hippopotamusoccupied Britain. Coral reefs expanded latitudinally and contracted equatorially.

Ice sheets covered much of North America and north-west Eurasia, and sea level was commensurately lower. Atmospheric CO2 was lower; more carbon was sequestered in the ocean interior. Precipitation was generally lower over most regions; the atmosphere was dustier, and ranges of many plant species contracted into glacial refugia; forest extent and coral reef distribution was reduced worldwide.

Sea level, ocean meridional overturning circulation, and atmospheric CO2 increased during two main steps. Temperate and boreal species ranges expanded northwards. Community turnover was large.

Climate changes were driven by solar, volcanic, land cover, and anthropogenic forcings, including strong increases in greenhouse gasses since 1750.

Since AR5, new proxy records have improved climate reconstructions at decadal scale across the last millennium. Therefore, the dates of events within these two roughly defined periods are stated explicitly when possible. Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, Figure 1 | Global mean surface temperature (GMST) over the past 60 million years (60 Myr) relative to 1850–1900 shown on three time scales. Information about each of the nine paleo reference periods (blue font) and sections in AR6 that discuss these periods are listed in Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 Table 1. Grey horizontal bars at the top mark important events. Characteristic uncertainties are based on expert judgement and are representative of the approximate midpoint of their respective time scales; uncertainties decrease forward in time. GMST estimates for most paleo reference periods (Figure 2.34) overlap with this reconstruction, but take into account multiple lines of evidence. Future projections span the range of global surface air temperature best estimates for SSP1–2.6 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios described in Section 1.6. Range shown for 2100 is based on CMIP6 multi-model mean for 2081–2100 from Table 4.5; range for 2300 is based upon an emulator and taken from Table 4.9.
