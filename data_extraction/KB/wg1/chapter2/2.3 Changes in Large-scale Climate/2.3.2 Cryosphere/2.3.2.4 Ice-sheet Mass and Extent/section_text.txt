The AR5 reported that there was  high confidence that the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) was losing mass. The average ice mass loss from Antarctica was 97 [58 to 135] Gt yr–1 (GMSL equivalent of 0.27 [0.16 to 0.37] mm yr–1) over 1993–2010, and 147 [74 to 221] Gt yr–1 (0.41 [0.20 to 0.61] mm yr–1) over 2005–2010. These assessments included the Antarctic peripheral glaciers. The AR5 reported with  high confidence that the volume of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) was reduced during warm periods of the past few million years. The SROCC concluded that over 2006–2015, the AIS lost mass at an average rate of 155 ± 19 Gt yr–1 (very high confidence). The SROCC also stated that it is virtually certain that the Antarctic Peninsula and WAIS combined have cumulatively lost mass since widespread measurements began in 1992, and that the rate of loss has increased since around 2006.Process understanding and, to some extent, paleoclimate records show that changes in parts of the AIS can occur over multi-century time scales (<2kyr; Sections 9.4.2.3 and 9.6.2; e.g., Dowdeswell et al., 2020). Based on physical understanding, paleo evidence and numerical simulations, it is very likely  that the AIS has been smaller than today during at least some past warm climates (such as MCO and LIG), in particular the WAIS (Figure 9.18; Golledge et al., 2014; de Boer et al., 2015; DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Levy et al., 2016). Results from sediment studies suggest a smaller AIS during the MPWP compared with current levels, with main differences in the WAIS (Section 9.6.2; SROCC, IPCC, 2019; Bertram et al., 2018; Shakun et al., 2018). Marine sediments indicate that during the Pleistocene repeated ungrounding and loss of large marine-based parts of the AIS occurred during interglacial periods, with at least seven transitions between floating and grounded ice in the Ross Sea during the last 780 kyr (McKay et al., 2012) and at least three reductions in ice volume in the Wilkes Basin during the last 500 kyr (Wilson et al., 2018). Proxies, modelling and process understanding (Rohling et al., 2019; Clark et al., 2020) indicate that the AIS was smaller during the LIG than present.Geological evidence has been used to reconstruct Holocene glacial fluctuations of the ice sheet margin and lowerings of its surface, which occurred at different times in different places, as recently reviewed by Noble et al. (2020). In West Antarctica, marine sediments below the ice sheet (Kingslake et al., 2018) corroborate a previous glacial isostatic adjustment modelling study (Bradley et al., 2015), which suggests that ice had retreated behind the present grounding line prior to about 10 ka, and then readvanced. Geophysical imaging indicates a readvance in this area around 6 ± 2 ka (Wearing and Kingslake, 2019). Other studies from the region conclude that ice-sheet retreat and thinning was fastest from 9 to 8 ka (Johnson et al., 2014; McKay et al., 2016; Spector et al., 2017), or millennia later, during the MH (Hein et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2019), with indications of a subsequent readvance (Venturelli et al., 2020). In East Antarctica, rapid ice-sheet thinning occurred between around 9 and 5 ka (Jones et al., 2015), consistent with previous work indicating that the ice sheet in many regions was at or close to its current position by 5 ka (Bentley et al., 2014). Overall, during the MH, the AIS was retreating, but remained more extensive than present, while some parts of the ice sheet might have been smaller than now (low confidence).Improved estimates of surface mass balance (SMB) in Antarctica from 67 ice core records do not show any substantial changes in accumulation rates over most of Antarctica since 1200 CE (Frezzotti et al., 2013). The SMB growth rate in Antarctica is estimated to be 7.0 ± 0.1 Gt per decade between 1800 and 2010 and 14.0 ± 1.8 Gt per decade since 1900 (Thomas et al., 2017). For the period 1979–2000, an insignificant Antarctic-wide negative SMB trend has been estimated (Medley and Thomas, 2019). The Antarctic Ice Sheet lost 2670 [1800 to 3540]Gt (SLE 7.4 [5.0 to 9.8]mm) of ice between 1992 and 2020. The rate of ice-sheet (including peripheral glaciers) mass loss rose from 0 [–36 to +40] Gt yr–1 (SLE 0.0 [–0.10 to 0.11] mm yr–1) in 1901–1990 to 192 [145 to 239] Gt yr–1 (SLE 0.54 [0.47 to 0.61] mm yr–1) for 2006–2018 (Section 9.4.2, Figure 2.24, and Table 9.5). Within quantified uncertainties, this estimate agrees with other recent estimates (Rignot et al., 2019; B. Smith et al., 2020; Velicogna et al., 2020). There is therefore very high confidence that the AIS has been losing mass over 1992–2020 (Section 9.4.2.1 and Figure 2.24). Major contributions to recent AIS changes arise from West Antarctica and Wilkes Land in East Antarctica (Rignot et al., 2019). For the East Antarctic most studies suggest that the mass balance is not significantly different from zero (Bamber et al., 2018; IMBIE Consortium, 2018; Mohajerani et al., 2018; Rignot et al., 2019).Figure 2. 24 | Cumulative Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) and Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) mass changes. Values shown are in gigatons and come from satellite-based measurements (IMBIE Consortium, 2018, 2020) for the period 1992–2020. The estimated uncertainties, very likely range, for the respective cumulative changes are shaded. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 2.SM.1). Open figureIn summary, the AIS has lost mass between 1992 and 2020 (very high confidence), and there is medium confidence that this mass loss has increased. During the MPWP and LIG, the ice sheet was smaller than present (medium confidence). There is low confidence as to  whether the total mass of the ice sheet was larger or smaller around 6 ka compared to now.
