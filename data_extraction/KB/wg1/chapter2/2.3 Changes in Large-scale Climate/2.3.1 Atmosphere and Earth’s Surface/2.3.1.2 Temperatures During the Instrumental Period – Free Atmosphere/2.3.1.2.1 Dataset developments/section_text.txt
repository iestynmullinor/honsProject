There have been updated radiosonde estimates from the University of Vienna (RAOBCORE and RICH; Haimberger et al., 2012) and a new dataset from the State University of New York (UAHRD, Zhou et al., 2020). There are new versions of AMSU products from the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAHv6.0; Spencer et al., 2017) and Remote Sensing Systems (RSSv4.0; Mears and Wentz, 2017). These updates have led to convergence in the lower stratosphere layer (Maycock et al., 2018); in particular, the move to UAHv6.0 has addressed homogeneity issues identified by Seidel et al. (2016), although residual differences remain (Christy et al., 2018). Reanalyses products had identified limitations near the 300 hPa level where the contribution of aircraft observations has increased rapidly in recent years (Dee et al., 2011; Gelaro et al., 2017), leading to identified biases (Dee and Uppala, 2009), that have been addressed in ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020). Modern reanalyses are generally well aligned with radiosonde and satellite observations in the middle and lower troposphere and lower stratosphere. A new operational mid- and upper-stratospheric dataset (STAR) has been developed by Zou and Qian (2016), merging the previous 1979–2006 SSU dataset (Zou et al., 2014) with a dataset from 1998 onwards drawn from relevant AMSU channels (Wang and Zou, 2014). Further stratospheric satellite-based datasets from various combinations of satellites have been developed by McLandress et al. (2015) and Randel et al. (2016).New assessments of free-atmosphere temperature are available through radio occultation (RO) and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) products which begin in the early 2000s (Section 1.5.1.1). Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-RO datasets have been compared against AMSU data records, finding almost identical trends (Khaykin et al., 2017). Comparison of RO with collocated radiosondes, Vaisala RS90/92 and GCOS Reference Upper Air Network data (RS92-GDP; Dirksen et al., 2014), show very good correspondence with global annual mean differences of less than 0.2°C in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Radiosonde daytime radiation biases were identified at higher altitudes (Ladstädter et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2017). The stability of RO makes this data a useful comparator for AMSU (Chen and Zou, 2014) and radiosondes (Ho et al., 2017; Tradowsky et al., 2017), as well as anchoring post-2006 reanalyses datasets and improving their consistency in the lower and middle stratosphere (Long et al., 2017; Ho et al., 2020). The effective vertical resolution of RO measurements in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere was found to be up to 100 m at the tropical tropopause (Zeng et al., 2019a), which is favourable for resolving atmospheric variability (Scherllin-Pirscher et al., 2012; Wilhelmsen et al., 2018; Stocker et al., 2019). Temperature trends in RO products are most consistent with each other and with other observations between 8 km and 25 km (Ho et al., 2012; Steiner et al., 2013, 2020a). The uncertainty increases above 25 km for the early RO period, for which data are based on the single-satellite CHAMP mission, but data at higher altitudes become more reliable for later missions based on advanced receivers (Steiner et al., 2020a), along with the application of corrections for ionospheric effects (Danzer et al., 2020). The uncertainty due to the changing number of observations is reduced by correcting for the sampling uncertainty in RO climatological fields (e.g., Scherllin-Pirscher et al., 2011). For AIRS, thus far, stability of the instrument has been constrained to less than 0.03°C per decade for selected window channels in a comparison to SSTs measured by ocean buoys (Aumann et al., 2019). Trends were inter-compared with trends in RO data and reanalysis data to assess systematic uncertainties (Leroy et al., 2018).
