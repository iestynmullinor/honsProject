The AR5 concluded that there was low confidence in a positive trend in global river discharge during the 20th century. It noted that many of the largest rivers with long term streamflow records have been impacted by non-climatic human influences such as dam construction or land-use change.River discharge is monitored widely, although gaps remain at a subcontinental scale over central Asia and Africa (Wei et al., 2020). Substantial recent efforts have been made to generate new global streamflow datasets, consolidating observations from many stream gauges to create streamflow indices (Do et al., 2018; Gudmundsson et al., 2018) and gridded products using neural networks (Barbarossa et al., 2018) or combinations between observations and reanalyses (Suzuki et al., 2018; Ghiggi et al., 2019).Human intervention on river discharge linked to increases in evapotranspiration and some reduction of intra-annual streamflow variability (Jaramillo and Destouni, 2015; Chai et al., 2020) might affect the detection of trends in extreme daily streamflow events (Do et al., 2017; Gudmundsson et al., 2019). However, these activities have a minor impact on annual streamflow compared to climate variations (Dai et al., 2009; Alkama et al., 2013). Available global studies post-1950 generally concur that there have been more rivers experiencing decreases than increases in runoff (Do et al., 2017; Su et al., 2018; Gudmundsson et al., 2019; X. Shi et al., 2019). Most of the rivers have not experienced statistically significant changes in streamflow, and when globally aggregated there is no significant change (Dai and Zhao, 2017). Global streamflow variability is strongly modulated by ENSO and PDV, with below-normal global streamflow as a response to El Niño events and vice-versa during La Niña episodes (Dai, 2016; Liang et al., 2016; Kim, 2019). The response of streamflow to changes in precipitation associated with ENSO and PDV has heterogeneous regional patterns at subcontinental scales (Section 8.3.2.9.1). No significant trends are found for reanalysis-based discharge estimates over 1993 to 2015 (Chandanpurkar et al., 2017). Uncertainties in global streamflow trends arise predominantly from changes in instrumentation, gauge restoration, recalibration of rating curves, flow regulation or channel engineering (Alkama et al., 2011; Gudmundsson et al., 2018; Ghiggi et al., 2019).In summary, the sign of global streamflow trends remains uncertain, with slightly more globally gauged rivers experiencing significantly decreasing flows than significantly increasing flows since the 1950s (low confidence).
