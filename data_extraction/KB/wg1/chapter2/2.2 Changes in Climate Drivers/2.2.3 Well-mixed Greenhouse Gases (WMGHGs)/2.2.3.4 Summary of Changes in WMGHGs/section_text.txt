In summary, CO2 has fluctuated by at least 2000 ppm over the last 450 Myr (medium confidence). The last time CO2 concentrations were similar to the present-day was over 2 Ma (high confidence). Further, it is certain that WMGHG mixing ratios prior to industrialization were lower than present-day levels and the growth rates of the WMGHGs from 1850 are unprecedented on centennial timescales in at least the last 800 kyr. During the glacial-interglacial climate cycles over the last 800 kyr, the concentration variations of the WMGHG were 50–100 ppm for CO2, 210–430 ppb for CH4 and 60–90 ppb for N2O. Between 1750–2019 mixing ratios increased by 131.6 ± 2.9 ppm (47%), 1137 ± 10 ppb (156%), and 62 ± 6 ppb (23%), for CO2, CH4, and N2O, respectively (very high confidence). Since 2011 (AR5) mixing ratios of CO2, CH4, and N2O have further increased by 19 ppm, 63 ppb, and 7.7 ppb, reaching in 2019 levels of 409.9 (± 0.4) ppm, 1866.3 (± 3.3) ppb, and 332.1 (± 0.4) ppb, respectively. By 2019, the combined ERF (relative to 1750) of CO2, CH4 and N2O was 2.9 ± 0.5 W m–2 (Table 2.2; Section 7.3.2).
