Isotopes from continental and marine sediments using improved analytical techniques and sampling resolution have reinforced the understanding of long-term changes in atmospheric CO2 during the past 450 Myr (Table 2.1 and Figure 2.3). In particular, for the last 60 Myr, sampling resolution and accuracy of the boron isotope proxy in ocean sediments has improved (Penman et al., 2014; Anagnostou et al., 2016, 2020; Chalk et al., 2017; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Babila et al., 2018; Dyez et al., 2018; Raitzsch et al., 2018; Sosdian et al., 2018; Henehan et al., 2019, 2020; de la Vega et al., 2020; Harper et al., 2020), the understanding of the alkenone CO2 proxy has increased (e.g., Badger et al., 2019; Stoll et al., 2019; Y. Zhang et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2021) and new phytoplankton proxies have been developed and applied (e.g., Witkowski et al., 2018). Understanding of the boron isotope CO2 proxy has improved since AR5 with studies showing very good agreement between boron-CO2 estimates and co-existing ice core CO2 (Hönisch and Hemming, 2005; Foster, 2008; Henehan et al., 2013; Chalk et al., 2017; Raitzsch et al., 2018; see Figure 2.3c). Such independent validation has proven difficult to achieve with the other available CO2 proxies (e.g., Badger et al., 2019; Da et al., 2019; Stoll et al., 2019; Y. Zhang et al., 2019). Remaining uncertainties in these ocean sediment based proxies (Hollis et al., 2019) partly limit the applicability of the alkenoneδ13C and boronδ11B proxies beyond the Cenozoic, although new records are emerging, for example, Jurikova et al. (2020). CO2 estimates from the terrestrial CO2 proxies, such as stomatal density in fossil plants and δ13C of palaeosol carbonates, are available for much of the last 420 Myr. Given the low sampling density, relatively large CO2 uncertainty, and high age uncertainty (relative to marine sediments) of the terrestrial proxies, preference here is given to the marine based proxies (and boron in particular) where possible.Table 2.1 | Concentration (mixing ratios) and, where applicable, century time-scale rate of change of atmospheric CO2  based on multiple datasets for target paleoclimate reference (Cross-Chapter Box 2.1, and Figure 2.34) and selected other periods. Modern data are from Section 2.2.3.3 and Annex III. ‘AR6’ denotes best estimates assessed in this report and propagated to Figure 2.34. Units for the rate of change are given only for centennial periods characterized by rapid changes.  confidence levels are very high for instrumentally derived concentrations,  high for values derived from air in glacier ice (back to LIG), medium for values supported by multiple proxy types (MPWP, EECO), and low for values from a single sedimentary proxy type (PETM). ‘→’ indicates transition from the beginning to the end of the time interval. Uncertainties for Modern are based on 2019 estimates. Last Millennium rate of range shows lowest and highest values attained during this period; LDT shows highest rate of change. N/A indicates that values are not available. See chapter data table for bibliographic citation and auxiliary information for each dataset (Table 2.SM.1).

The values (x to y) representvery likely ranges (90% CIs).b Data uncertainty is not estimated.Levels were close to 1750 values during at least one prolonged interval during the Carboniferous and Permian (350–252 Ma). During the Triassic (251.9–201.3 Ma), atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios reached a maximum of between 2000–5000 ppm (200–220 Ma). During the PETM (56 Ma) CO2 rapidly rose from about 900 ppm to about 2000 ppm (Table 2.1; Schubert and Jahren, 2013; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Anagnostou et al., 2020) in 3–20 kyr (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Turner, 2018). Estimated multi-millennial rates of CO2 accumulation during this event range from 0.3–1.5 PgC yr–1 (Gingerich, 2019), at least 4–5 times lower than current centennial rates (Section 5.3.1.1). Based on boron and carbon isotope data, supported by other proxies (Hollis et al., 2019), atmospheric CO2 during the EECO (50 Ma) was between 1150 and 2500 ppm (medium confidence), and then gradually declined over the last 50 Myr at a long-term rate of about 16 ppm Myr–1 (Figure 2.3). The last time the CO2 mixing ratio was as high as 1000 ppm (the level reached by some high emissions scenarios by 2100; Annex III) was prior to the Eocene-Oligocene transition (33.5 Ma; Figure 2.3) that was associated with the first major advance of the AIS (Pearson et al., 2009; Pagani et al., 2011; Anagnostou et al., 2016; Witkowski et al., 2018; Hollis et al., 2019). The compilation of Foster et al. (2017) constrained CO2 concentration to between 290 and 450 ppm during the MPWP, based primarily on the boron-isotope data reported by Martínez-Botí et al. (2015b), consistent with the AR5 range of 300–450 ppm. A more recent high-resolution boron isotope-based study revealed that CO2 cycled during the MPWP from about 330 to about 390 ppm on orbital timescales, with a mean of about 370 ppm (de la Vega et al., 2020). Although data from other proxy types (e.g., stomatal density orδ13C of alkenones) have too low resolution to resolve the orbital-related variability of CO2 during this interval (e.g., Kürschner et al., 1996; Stoll et al., 2019) there is general agreement among the different proxy types with the boron-derived mean (e.g., Stoll et al., 2019). High-resolution sampling (about 1 sample per 3 kyr) with the boron-isotope proxy indicates mean CO2 mixing ratios for the Marine Isotope Stage KM5c interglacial were 360–420 ppm (medium confidence) (de la Vega et al., 2020).Figure 2.3 | The evolution of atmospheric CO2 through the last 450 million years (450 Myr).  The periods covered are 0–450 Ma (a), 0–58 Ma (b), and 0–3500 ka (c), reconstructed from continental rock, marine sediment and ice core records. Note different time scales and axes ranges in panels (a), (b) and (c). Dark and light green bands in (a) are uncertainty envelopes at 68% and 95% uncertainty, respectively. 100 ppm in each panel is shown by the marker in the lower right-hand corner to aid comparison between panels. In panel (b) and (c) the major paleoclimate reference periods (CCB2.1) have been labelled, and in addition: MPT (Mid Pleistocene Transition), MCO (Miocene Climatic Optimum). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 2.SM.1). Open figureFollowing the MPWP, the atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio generally decreased at a rate of about 30 ppm Myr–1. It is very likely  that CO2 levels as high as the present were not experienced in the last 2 Myr (Hönisch et al., 2009; Bartoli et al., 2011; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; Chalk et al., 2017; Dyez et al., 2018; Da et al., 2019; Stoll et al., 2019). Related to the shift of glacial-interglacial cycle frequency from 40 to 100 kyr at 0.8–1.2 Ma, there was a decrease of glacial-period CO2 (Chalk et al., 2017; Dyez et al., 2018). These boron isotope-based CO2 results agree with available records based on ancient ice exposed near the surface of the AIS (Yan et al., 2019), however, direct comparison is limited due to a lack of ancient ice cores with sufficiently continuous stratigraphy (Higgins et al., 2015; Brook and Buizert, 2018).To conclude, there is  high confidence that average EECO and MPWP (KM5c) CO2 concentrations were higher than those preceding industrialization at 1150–2500 ppm and 360–420 ppm, respectively. Although there is some uncertainty due to the non-continuous nature of marine sediment records, the last time atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio was as high as present was very likely  more than 2 Ma.
