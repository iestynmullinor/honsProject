New records show that N2O concentration changes are associated with glacial-interglacial transitions (Schilt et al., 2014). The most rapid change during the last glacial termination is a 30 ppb increase in a 200-year period, which is an order of magnitude smaller than the modern rate (Section 2.2.3.3). During the LGM, N2O was 208.5 ± 7.7 ppb (Kageyama et al., 2017). Over the Holocene the lowest value was 257 ± 6.6 ppb during 6–8 ka, but millennial variation is not clearly detectable due to analytical uncertainty and insufficient ice core quality (Flückiger et al., 2002; Schilt et al., 2010). Recently acquired high-resolution records from Greenland and Antarctica for the last 2 kyr consistently show multi-centennial variations of about 5–10 ppb (Figure 2.4), although the magnitudes vary over time (Ryu et al., 2020). Three high temporal resolution records exhibit a short-term minimum at about 600 CE of 261 ± 4 ppb (MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Ryu et al., 2020). It is very likely  that industrial N2O increase started before 1900 CE (Machida et al., 1995; Sowers, 2001; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Ryu et al., 2020). Multiple ice cores show N2O concentrations of 270.1 ± 6.0 ppb in 1750 and 272.1 ± 5.7 ppb in 1850 (Machida et al., 1995; Flückiger et al., 1999; Sowers, 2001; Rubino et al., 2019; Ryu et al., 2020).
