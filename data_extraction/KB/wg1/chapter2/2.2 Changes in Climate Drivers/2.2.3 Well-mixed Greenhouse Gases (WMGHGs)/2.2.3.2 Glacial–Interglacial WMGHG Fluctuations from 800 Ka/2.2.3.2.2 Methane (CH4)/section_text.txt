CH4 concentrations over the past 110 kyr are higher in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), but closely correlated on centennial and millennial timescales (Buizert et al., 2015). On glacial to interglacial cycles, approximately 450 ppb oscillations in CH4 concentrations have occurred (Loulergue et al., 2008). On millennial timescales, most rapid climate changes observed in Greenland and other regions are coincident with rapid CH4 changes (Buizert et al., 2015; Rhodes et al., 2015, 2017). The variability of CH4 on centennial timescales during the early Holocene does not significantly differ from that of the late Holocene prior to about 1850 (Rhodes et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2017). The LGM concentration was 390.5 ± 6.0 ppb (Kageyama et al., 2017). The global mean concentrations during 0–1850 CE varied between 625 and 807 ppb. High-resolution ice core records from Antarctica and Greenland exhibit the same trends with an inter-polar difference of 36–47 ppb (Sapart et al., 2012; L. Mitchell et al., 2013). There is a long-term positive trend of about 0.5 ppb per decade during the CE until 1750 CE. The most rapid CH4 changes prior to industrialization were as large as 30–50 ppb on multi-decadal timescales. Global mean CH4 concentrations estimated from Antarctic and Greenland ice cores are 729.2 ± 9.4 ppb in 1750 and 807.6 ± 13.8 ppb in 1850 (L. Mitchell et al., 2013).
