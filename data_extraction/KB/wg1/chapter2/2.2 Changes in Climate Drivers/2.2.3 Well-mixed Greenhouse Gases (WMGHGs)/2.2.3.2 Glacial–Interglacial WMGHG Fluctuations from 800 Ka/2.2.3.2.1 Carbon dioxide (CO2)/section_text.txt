Records of CO2 from the AIS formed during the last glacial period and the LDT show century-scale fluctuations of up to 9.6 ppm (Ahn et al., 2012; Ahn and Brook, 2014; Marcott et al., 2014; Bauska et al., 2015; Rubino et al., 2019). Although these rates are an order of magnitude lower than those directly observed over 1919–2019 CE (Section 2.2.3.3.1), they provide information on non-linear responses of climate-biogeochemical feedbacks (Section 5.1.2). Multiple records for 0–1850 CE show CO2 mixing ratios of 274–285 ppm. Offsets among ice core records are about 1%, but the long-term trends agree well and show coherent multi-centennial variations of about 10 ppm (Ahn et al., 2012; Bauska et al., 2015; Rubino et al., 2019). Multiple records show CO2 concentrations of 278.3 ± 2.9 ppm in 1750 and 285.5 ± 2.1 ppm in 1850 (Siegenthaler et al., 2005; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Ahn et al., 2012; Bauska et al., 2015). CO2 concentration increased by 5.0 ± 0.8 ppm during 970–1130 CE, followed by a decrease of 4.6 ± 1.7 ppm during 1580–1700 CE. The greatest rate of change over the CE prior to 1750 is observed at about 1600 CE, and ranges from –6.9 to +4.7 ppm per century in multiple high-resolution ice core records (Siegenthaler et al., 2005; MacFarling Meure et al., 2006; Ahn et al., 2012; Bauska et al., 2015; Rubino et al., 2019). Although ice core records present low-pass filtered time series due to gas diffusion and gradual bubble close-off in the snow layer over the ice sheet (Fourteau et al., 2020), the rate of increase since 1850 CE (about 125 ppm increase over about 170 years) is far greater than implied for any 170-year period by ice core records that cover the last 800 ka (very high confidence).
