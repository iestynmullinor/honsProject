The globally averaged surface mixing ratio of CH4 in 2019 was 1866.3 ± 3.3 ppb, which is 3.5% higher than 2011, while observed increases from various networks range from 3.3–3.9% (Table 2.2 and Figure 2.5b). There are marked growth rate changes over the period of direct observations, with a decreasing rate from the late-1970s through the late-1990s, very little change in concentrations from 1999–2006, and resumed increases since 2006. Atmospheric CH4 fluctuations result from complex variations of sources and sinks. A detailed discussion of recent methane trends and our understanding of their causes is presented in Cross-Chapter Box 5.2.
