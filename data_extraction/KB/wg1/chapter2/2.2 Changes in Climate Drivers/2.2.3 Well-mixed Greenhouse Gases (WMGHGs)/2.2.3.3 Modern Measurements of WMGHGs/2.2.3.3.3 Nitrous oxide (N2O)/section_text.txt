The AR5 reported 324.2 ± 0.1 ppb for global surface annual mean N2O in 2011; since then, it has increased by 2.4% to 332.1 ± 0.4 ppb in 2019. Independent measurement networks agree well for both the global mean mixing ratio and relative change since 2011 (Table 2.2). Over 1995–2011, N2O increased at an average rate of 0.79 ± 0.05 ppb yr–1. The growth rate has been higher in recent years, amounting to 0.96 ± 0.05 ppb yr–1 from 2012 to 2019 (Figure 2.5c and Section 5.2.3.5).
