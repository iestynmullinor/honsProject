Atmospheric abundances of most CFCs have continued to decline since 2011 (AR5). The globally-averaged abundance of CFC-12 decreased by 25 ppt (4.8%) from 2011 to 2019, while CFC-11 decreased by about 11 ppt (4.7%) over the same period (Table 2.2 and Figure 2.6). Atmospheric abundances of some minor CFCs (CFC-13, CFC-115, CFC-113a) have increased since 2011 (Annex III), possibly related to use of HFCs (Laube et al., 2014). Overall, as of 2019 the ERF from CFCs has declined by 9 ± 0.5% from its maximum in 2000, and 4.7 ± 0.6% since 2011 (Table 7.5).Figure 2.6 | Global mean atmospheric mixing ratios of select ozone-depletingsubstances and other greenhouse gases. Data shown are based on the CMIP6 historical dataset and data from NOAA and AGAGE global networks. PFCs include CF4, C2 f6, and C3F8, and c-C4F8; Halons include halon-1211, halon-1301, and halon-2402; other HFCs include HFC-23, HFC-32, HFC-125, HFC-143a, HFC-152a, HFC-227ea, HFC-236fa, HFC-245fa, and HFC-365mfc, and HFC-43-10mee. Note that the y-axis range is different for (a),  (b)  and  (c) and a 25 parts per trillion (ppt) yardstick is given next to each panel to aid interpretation. Further data are in Annex III and details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 2.SM.1). Open figureWhile global reporting indicated that CFC-11 production had essentially ceased by 2010, and the atmospheric abundance of CFC-11 is still decreasing, emissions inferred from atmospheric observations began increasing in 2013–2014 and remained elevated for 5–6 years, suggesting renewed and unreported production (Montzka et al., 2018a, 2021; Rigby et al., 2019; Park et al., 2021). The global lifetimes of several ozone-depleting substances have been updated (SPARC, 2013), in particular for CFC-11 from 45 to 52 years.
