In summary, by 2019 the ERF of halogenated GHGs had increased by 3.5% since 2011, reflecting predominantly a decrease in the atmospheric mixing ratios of CFCs and an increase in their replacements. However, average annual ERF growth rates associated with halogenated gases since 2011 are a factor of seven lower than in the 1970s and 1980s. Direct radiative forcings from CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, and other halogenated greenhouse gases were 0.28, 0.06, 0.04, and 0.03 W m–2 respectively, totalling 0.41 ± 0.07 W m–2 in 2019 (see Table 7.5).
