Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are replacements for CFCs and HCFCs. The atmospheric abundances of many HFCs increased between 2011 and 2019. HFC-134a (mobile air conditioning, foam blowing, and domestic refrigerators) increased by 71% from 63 ppt in 2011 to 107.6 ppt in 2019 (Table 2.2). The UCI network detected a slightly smaller relative increase (53%). HFC-23, which is emitted as a by-product of HCFC-22 production, increased by 8.4 ppt (35%) over 2011–2019. HFC-32 used as a substitute for HCFC-22, increased at least by 300%, and HFC-143a and HFC-125 showed increases of 100% and 187%, respectively. While the ERF of HFC-245fa is currently <0.001 W m–2, its atmospheric abundance doubled since 2011 to 3.1 ppt in 2019 (Annex III). In contrast, HFC-152a is showing signs of stable (steady-state) abundance.Other radiatively important gases with predominantly anthropogenic sources also continue to increase in abundance. SF6, used in electrical distribution systems, magnesium production, and semi-conductor manufacturing, increased from 7.3 ppt in 2011 to 10.0 ppt in 2019 (+36%). Alternatives to SF6 or SF6-free equipment for electrical systems have become available in recent years, but SF6 is still widely in use in electrical switch gear (Simmonds et al., 2020). The global lifetime of SF6 has been revised from 3200 years to about 1000 years (Kovács et al., 2017; Ray et al., 2017) with implications for climate emissions metrics (Section 7.6.2). NF3, which is used in the semi-conductor industry, increased 147% over the same period to 2.05 ppt in 2019. Its contribution to ERF remains small, however, at 0.0004 W m–2. The atmospheric abundance of SO2 f2, which is used as a fumigant in place of ozone-depleting methyl bromide, reached 2.5 ppt in 2019, a 46% increase from 2011. Its ERF also remains small at 0.0005 W m–2.The global abundance of CCl4 continues to decline, down about 9.6% since 2011. Following a revision of the global lifetime from 26 to 32 years, and discovery of previously unknown sources (e.g., biproducts of industrial emissions), knowledge of the CCl4 budget has improved. There is now better agreement between top-down emissions estimates (based on atmospheric measurements) and industry-based estimates (Engel et al., 2018). Halon-1211, mainly used for fire suppression, is also declining, and its ERF dropped below 0.001 W m–2 in 2019. While CH2 cl2 has a short atmospheric lifetime (6 months), and is not well-mixed, its abundance is increasing and its ERF is approaching 0.001 W m–2.Perfluorocarbons CF4 and C2 f6, which have exceedingly long global lifetimes, showed modest increases from 2011 to 2019. CF4, which has both natural and anthropogenic sources, increased 8.2% to 85.5 ppt, and C2 f6 increased 16.3% to 4.85 ppt. c–C4F8, which is used in the electronics industry and may also be generated during the production of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, also known as ‘Teflon’) and other fluoropolymers (Mühle et al., 2019), has increased 34% since 2011 to 1.75 ppt, although its ERF remains below 0.001 W m–2. Other PFCs, present at mixing ratios <1 ppt, have also been quantified (Droste et al., 2020; see Annex III).Figure 2.37 | Indices of interannual climate variability from 1950–2019 based upon several sea surface temperature data products.
