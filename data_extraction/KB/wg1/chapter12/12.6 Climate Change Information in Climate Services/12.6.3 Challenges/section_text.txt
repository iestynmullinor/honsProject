Climate services set new scientific challenges to physical climate research (high confidence). Over at least the last decade, for instance, many questions have appeared in terms of optimal estimation of changes and uncertainties from projections of model ensembles, ensemble optimization, or adjustment of model biases while preserving essential information on trends and cross-variable, time and space consistencies, downscaling information at the local scale (Benestad et al., 2017; Hewitt et al., 2017b; Marotzke et al., 2017; Hewitt and Lowe, 2018; Knutti, 2019; see also Section 10.5). Other challenges related to climate services are the inter-operability of data (Giuliani et al., 2017), access to data (open/FAIR Guiding principles; Wilkinson et al., 2016; Georgeson et al., 2017), format of data (including moving away from percentile-based probabilistic forecasts (e.g., Haines, 2019)) and funding mechanisms (Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019).Understanding and modelling of weather and climate extremes is of great relevance for climate services and is continuing to set challenges for research, such as modelling changes in impact-relevant threshold exceedance and return periods for a variety of extremes (Maraun et al., 2015; Sillmann et al., 2017; Hewitt et al., 2021; Schwingshackl et al., 2021; see also Chapter 11). Extreme event attribution has also been used in context of climate services (Philip et al., 2020) as it is of interest to some stakeholder groups (Sippel et al., 2015; Marjanac and Patton, 2018; Jézéquel et al., 2019, 2020). The usefulness or applicability of available extreme event attribution methods (Section 11.2.4 and Cross-Working Group Box on Attribution in Chapter 1) for assessing climate-related risks remains subject to debate (Shepherd, 2016; Mann et al., 2017; Lloyd and Oreskes, 2018).The design of climate services involves addressing certain key challenges, such as a domain challenge where users, tasks and data may be unknown; or an informational challenge related to the use and adoption of novel and complex scientific data (Christel et al., 2018). This includes challenges in the uptake of climate information in terms of coordinated delivery of data, information, expertise and training by public research institutes, the inclusion of climate change adaptation in public and private regulation, and uncertainties and confidence in climate projections (Cavelier et al., 2017). Quality control and quality assurance are still weak elements in the development of climate service products (Jacob, 2020). Quality criteria or standards (that go beyond good practice) will have to be developed and agreed (Baldissera Pacchetti et al., 2021). These challenges reflect the dilemma that exists at the interface between the climate modelling community and climate services regarding: (i) the purposes of the models for climate research versus service development; (ii) the gap between the spatial and temporal scales of the models versus the scales needed in applications; and (iii) tailoring climate model results to real-world applications (Benestad et al., 2017; Hackenbruch et al., 2017; van den Hurk et al., 2018).Climate services require a sustained engagement between scientists, service providers and users that is often hindered by limited resources for the co-design and co-production process(high confidence). There are recurring challenges related to successful climate service applications: (i) climate services are not visible and are poorly understood by ‘end users’ (Weichselgartner and Arheimer, 2019); (ii) data can be of unknown or poor quality, data formats can be hard to access or process, and it can be difficult to utilize data disseminated from large databases (e.g., Section 1.5.4) without appropriate user guidance; (iii) users are unsure how to choose from available climate services to meet their needs (Rössler et al., 2019); (iv) building trust between climate service users and providers (Baztan et al., 2020); (v) the lack of understanding of users and their contexts by the climate science and service community (Porter and Dessai, 2017); (vi) the difficulty in scaling up services (Tall et al., 2014; van Huysen et al., 2018); (vii) the lack of trained scientists skilled at conducting societally relevant research (Rozance et al., 2020).Challenges also arise in determining the effectiveness and added value of climate services, particularly in terms of providing quantitative estimates of economic benefits and making a business case for climate services (Bruno Soares, 2017). The market for climate services is still in its infancy (Cavelier et al., 2017; Bruno Soares et al., 2018b; Tall et al., 2018; Damm et al., 2020). One form of value may be determined by a particular user community’s willingness to pay (Acquah and Onumah, 2011; Ouédraogo et al., 2018; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2021), which however cannot reflect the value of climate services as a public good and for society as a whole (Hewitt et al., 2012). Literature is only recently emerging on the socio-economic benefits of weather and climate services (Vaughan et al., 2019). Early studies and guidelines from the WMO focus on cost–benefit ratios (Perrels et al., 2013; WMO, 2015). Issues related to demand-driven versus supply-driven climate services (Lourenço et al., 2016; Street, 2016; Daniels et al., 2020), public versus private climate services (Hewitt et al., 2020a) and business models for climate services (Hoa, 2018) have been raised. A large share of climate services documented in peer-reviewed literature is currently provided in non-market frameworks (e.g., public service obligations and research and development grants) (Hoa, 2018; Kolstad et al., 2019; Cortekar et al., 2020).Other challenges related to governance and dealing with complex systems are sometimes acknowledged but less well described in the climate services domain (Hewitt et al., 2020a). Importantly, decision contexts are strongly rooted in past practice (which often does not even make optimal use of past climate information), stakeholder experience, and history. Even important emerging concepts of co-production, entry points, and champions do not always fall naturally into these realities without significant effort. The social sciences have an important role in helping understand and tackle these challenges (Bruno Soares and Buontempo, 2019).
