Additional CIDs may be relevant for regional studies but are not the focus of assessment in this Report. For example, information about changes in the frequency and seasonal timing of fog helps anticipate airport delays and cool beach days, and is also important for water delivery and retention in coastal ecological and agricultural systems (Torregrosa et al., 2014).Threats to many sectoral assets and associated systems may also be compounded when multiple hazards occur simultaneously in the same place, affect multiple regions at the same time, or occur in a sequence that may amplify overall impact (Section 11.8; IPCC, 2012; Clarke et al., 2018; Zscheischler et al., 2018; Raymond et al., 2020). There is emerging literature on many connected extremes and their associated hazards (e.g., climatic conditions that could drive multi-breadbasket failures; Trnka et al., 2019; Kornhuber et al., 2020), but a full accounting is not practical here especially considering the many possible CID combinations and the need to assess how exposed systems would be vulnerable to compound CIDs (assessed in WGII). Table 12.2 is once again instructive here in considering hazard-related storylines, as the multiple CIDs affecting a given sectoral asset (assessing across a row of Table 12.2) point to potentially dangerous hazard combinations. Similarly, change in a single CID has the potential to affect multiple sectoral assets (assessing down a column of Table 12.2) in a manner with broader systemic implications (AR6 WGII).Recent literature defines CID indices to represent trends and thresholds that influence sectoral assets, albeit with considerable variation owing to the unique characteristics of regional and sectoral assets. Indices include direct information about the CIDâ€™s profile (magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, spatial extent) or utilize atmospheric conditions as a proxy for CIDs that are more difficult to directly observe or simulate. Each sector is affected by multiple CIDs, and each CID affects multiple sectors. Assets within the same sector may require different or tailored indices even for the same CID. These indices may be defined to capture graduated thresholds associated with tipping points or inflection points in a particular sectoral vulnerability, with commonalities in the types of processes these thresholds represent even as their precise magnitude may vary by specific sectoral system and asset.
