Marine heatwaves (MHW) push water temperatures above key thresholds and have been associated with coral bleaching episodes, species shifts and harmful algal blooms that can disrupt ecosystems, tourism and human health (Box 9.2; Wernberg et al., 2016; Arias-Ortiz et al., 2018; Oliver et al., 2018; Frölicher, 2019; Smale et al., 2019; Sully et al., 2019). The duration and return period of marine heatwaves provide insight into aggregate stresses on marine species, fisheries and ecosystems, with various indices gauging cumulative intensity or the number of days, weeks or months exceeding critical thresholds (Frieler et al., 2013; Frölicher et al., 2018; Hughes et al., 2018b; Cheung and Frölicher, 2020). Hobday et al. (2016) defined marine heatwaves as the exceedance of the 90th percentile of the sea surface temperature (SST) distribution on a given Julian day during five or more consecutive days, while Box 9.2, Figure 1 shows MHW as an exceedance of 99th-percentile 11-day de-seasonalized SSTs. The return period of marine heatwaves is also critical in determining a coral system’s ability to recover before the next event (Hughes et al., 2018a).
