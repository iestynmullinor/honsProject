Shifts in thermal zones affect the suitability of fisheries and marine and coastal species habitat and migration routes (Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010; Doney et al., 2012; Burrows et al., 2014; Urban, 2015; Hixson and Arts, 2016; Tripathi et al., 2016; N. Ahmed et al., 2019; Bindoff et al., 2019). Intertidal species are particularly dependent on suitable conditions for both air and sea surface temperatures (Monaco and McQuaid, 2019). The structure of ocean warming also affects the intensity of upper-ocean stratification and the timing and strength of coastal upwelling (driven also by mean wind changes), which alters the vertical transport of oxygen- and nutrient-rich waters affecting fishery and marine ecosystem productivity (D. Wang et al., 2015).
