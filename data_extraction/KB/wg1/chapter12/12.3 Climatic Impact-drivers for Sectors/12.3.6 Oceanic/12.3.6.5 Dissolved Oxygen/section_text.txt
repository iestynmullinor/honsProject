Ocean warming and increased stratification decrease the oxygen content of the ocean (Griffiths et al., 2017; Schmidtko et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019), lead to an expansion of oxygen minimum zones in the open ocean (Stramma et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013) and exacerbate the creation of anoxic ‘dead zones’ in the coastal oceans (Breitburg et al., 2018). Such a decline (characterized by successive dissolved oxygen concentration thresholds) could affect a wide range of marine organisms and reduce marine habitats (Chan et al., 2008; Vaquer-Sunyer and Duarte, 2008; Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno, 2010; Altieri and Gedan, 2015; Breitburg et al., 2018) and can also lead to further local acidification (Zhang and Gao, 2016; Laurent et al., 2017).
