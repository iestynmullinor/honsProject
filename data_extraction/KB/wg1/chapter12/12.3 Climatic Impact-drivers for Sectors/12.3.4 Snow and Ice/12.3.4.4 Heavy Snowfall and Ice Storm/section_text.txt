Heavy snowfall is a substantial concern for cities, settlements and key transportation and energy infrastructure (Ward, 2013; Palko, 2017; Janoski et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2019). Heavy snowfall can interfere with transportation (Herring et al., 2018) and cause a loss of both work and school days depending on local snow removal infrastructure. Freezing rain and ice storms can be treacherous for road and air travel (Tamerius et al., 2016), and can knock down power and telecommunication lines if ice accumulation is high (Degelia et al., 2016). Rain-on-snow events can create a solid barrier that hinders wildlife and livestock grazing that is important to indigenous communities (Forbes et al., 2016). Shifts in the frequency, seasonal timing and regions susceptible to ice storms alter risks for agriculture and infrastructure (Lambert and Hansen, 2011; Klima and Morgan, 2015; Ning and Bradley, 2015; Groisman et al., 2016).
