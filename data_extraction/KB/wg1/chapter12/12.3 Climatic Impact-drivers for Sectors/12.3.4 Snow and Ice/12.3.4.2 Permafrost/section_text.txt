Changes in permafrost temperature, extent and active layer thickness are metrics that track how permafrost thaw below, for example, roads, airstrips, rails and building foundations in high-latitude and mountain regions may destabilize settlements and critical infrastructure (Pendakur, 2016; Derksen et al., 2018; Duvillard et al., 2019; Olsson et al., 2019; Streletskiy et al., 2019). Warmer conditions can also affect ecosystems, built infrastructure and water resources through thawing of especially ice-rich permafrost (â‰¥20% ice content) and by thawing of ice wedges (Shiklomanov et al., 2017; Hjort et al., 2018), creation of thermokarst ponds and increased subsurface drainage for polar and high-mountain wetlands (Walvoord and Kurylyk, 2016; Farquharson et al., 2019) and the release of water pollutants such as mercury (Burkett, 2011; Schaeffer et al., 2012; Schuster et al., 2018).
