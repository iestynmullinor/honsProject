Information on the changing frequency and size distribution of hail can help stakeholders build resilience for agriculture, vehicles, transportation infrastructure and buildings, solar panels and wild species that see critical damage at particular hail size thresholds (Dessens et al., 2007; Webb et al., 2009; Patt et al., 2013; Fiss et al., 2019). Most climate models do not directly resolve hail and therefore studies often examine proxies associated with severe mesoscale storms (Tippett et al., 2015; Prein and Holland, 2018), although some regional studies now utilize hail-resolving models (Mahoney et al., 2012; Brimelow et al., 2017).
