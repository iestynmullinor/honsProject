Information about the changing frequency and seasonal timing of snow avalanches is important to assess threats to transportation routes, infrastructure, recreational skiing and people living in alpine communities (Lazar and Williams, 2008; Mock et al., 2017; Ballesteros-CÃ¡novas et al., 2018; Hock et al., 2019). Like landslides and other mass movements, snow avalanches are not directly resolved by climate models and are thus tracked using proxy climate information describing snow avalanche susceptibility, particularly the snow water equivalent, and triggering mechanisms such as warm spells, high winds, rain-on-snow and heavy precipitation (Hock et al., 2019). The quality of snow also provides insight into avalanche hazards (Mock et al., 2017), with the seasonal altitude of wet snowpack (>0.5% liquid water by volume) particularly important in determining characteristics of potential avalanches (Castebrunet et al., 2014).
