Changes in surface solar and longwave radiation fluxes alter photosynthesis rates and potential evapotranspiration for natural ecosystems and food, fibre and energy crops (MÃ¤kinen et al., 2018); changes in radiation fluxes can also shift solar energy resources (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Jerez et al., 2015; Wild et al., 2015; Fant et al., 2016; Craig et al., 2018). Plants and aquatic systems particularly respond to changes in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the fraction of diffuse radiation (Proctor et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2018; Ryu et al., 2018). Increases in ultraviolet radiation can also detrimentally affect ecosystems and human health (Barnes et al., 2019).
