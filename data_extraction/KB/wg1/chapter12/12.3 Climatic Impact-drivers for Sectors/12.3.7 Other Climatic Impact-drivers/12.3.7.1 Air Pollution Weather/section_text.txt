Although future air pollution will be strongly driven by air quality policies, anthropogenically-driven changes to temperature, humidity, precipitation and synoptic patterns have the potential to affect the emissions, production, concentration and transport of particulate matter (e.g., from dust, fires, pollen) and gaseous pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, tropospheric ozone and nitrogen dioxide (Section 6.5) with resulting impacts on human health, agriculture and ecosystems (Ren et al., 2011; Fiore et al., 2015; Kinney et al., 2015a; Tian et al., 2016; Orru et al., 2017; Emberson et al., 2018; Hayes et al., 2020). Information about conditions leading to poor air quality is also important for visibility in natural parks and tourist locations (Yue et al., 2013; Val Martin et al., 2015), as well as the efficiency of solar photovoltaic panels (Sweerts et al., 2019). Relevant information about conditions favouring air pollution includes tracking warmer conditions that accelerate ozone formation (Peel et al., 2013; Schnell et al., 2016) and the frequency and duration of stagnant air events (Horton et al., 2014; Fann et al., 2015; Lelieveld et al., 2015; Vautard et al., 2018), although no regional index has proven sufficient to capture regional changes or acute events (Kerr and Waugh, 2018; Schnell et al., 2018). By contrast, precipitation and moister air tend to reduce pollution (Section 6.5).
