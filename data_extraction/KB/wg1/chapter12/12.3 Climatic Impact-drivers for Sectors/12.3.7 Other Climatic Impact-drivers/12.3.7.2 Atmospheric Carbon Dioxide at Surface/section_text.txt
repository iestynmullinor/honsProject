Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a well-mixed greenhouse gas with global repercussions on Earth’s energy balance; however, atmospheric CO2 concentration changes at the land surface also affect plant functions within ecosystems and agriculture (see also Chapter 5). High CO2 concentration can increase photosynthesis rates and primary production within natural ecosystems (Norby et al., 2010; Ratliff et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2016) and agricultural crops (Hatfield et al., 2011; Leakey et al., 2012; Bell et al., 2013; Glenn et al., 2014; Nagelkerken and Connell, 2015; Behrenfeld et al., 2016; Deryng et al., 2016; Kimball, 2016). High CO2 concentration affects total biomass and plant sugar content important to bioenergy production (Schaeffer et al., 2012), but also helps some pests and weeds flourish (Hamilton et al., 2005; Wolfe et al., 2008; Valerio et al., 2013; Korres et al., 2016; Stinson et al., 2016; Ramesh et al., 2017), while potentially shifting the effectiveness of herbicides (Varanasi et al., 2016; Refatti et al., 2019). Higher CO2 concentration reduces transpiration losses during drought conditions (Cammarano et al., 2016; Deryng et al., 2016; Swann et al., 2016; Durand et al., 2018), which also changes the energy balance within the plant canopy (Webber et al., 2017). Higher CO2 reduces the nutritional density of crops and forage lands (Loladze, 2014; Müller et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2014, 2017; X. Li et al., 2016; M.A. Lee et al., 2017; Smith and Myers, 2018; Zhu et al., 2018; Beach et al., 2019) and can increase the production of toxins (Ziska et al., 2007) and allergenic pollen (Schmidt, 2016).
