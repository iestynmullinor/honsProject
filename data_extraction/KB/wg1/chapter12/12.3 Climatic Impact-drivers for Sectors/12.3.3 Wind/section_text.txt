Sand and dust storms erode soils, damage crops and induce problems for health, transportation, mechanical equipment and built infrastructure corresponding to the magnitude and duration of high winds and particulate matter concentrations (Goudie, 2014; Oâ€™Loingsigh et al., 2014; Crooks et al., 2016; Barreau et al., 2017; Bhattachan et al., 2018; Al Ameri et al., 2019; Middleton et al., 2019). Dust events may be represented as the number of dust hours per year and by particulate matter (PM) concentrations (Leys et al., 2011; Spickett et al., 2011; Hand et al., 2016). Photovoltaic panels can lose energy production efficiency with dust accumulation (Patt et al., 2013; Javed et al., 2017). It is also useful to track dust storm deposition of nutrients necessary for coral and tropical forest systems, but they may also feed algal blooms harming lake and coastal ecosystems, health and recreation (Jickells et al., 2005; Hallegraeff et al., 2014; Gabric et al., 2016). Dust storms also cause air pollution and redistribute the soil-based fungus associated with Valley fever (Barreau et al., 2017; Coopersmith et al., 2017; Tong et al., 2017; Gorris et al., 2018).
