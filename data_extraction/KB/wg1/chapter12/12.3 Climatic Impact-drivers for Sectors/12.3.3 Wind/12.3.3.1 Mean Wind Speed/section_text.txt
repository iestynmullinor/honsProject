Changes in the speed and direction of prevailing winds can alter the profile of seed dispersal, windblown pest and disease vectors, animal activities, and dust or pollen dispersal affecting ecosystems, agriculture and human health (Reid and Gamble, 2009; Bullock et al., 2012; Hellberg and Chu, 2016; Nourani et al., 2017). Seasonal winds influence algal blooms, ecosystems and fisheries via lake mixing, ocean currents and coastal upwelling (Bakun et al., 2015; Townhill et al., 2018; Woolway et al., 2020). Changes to wind density also modify a region’s wind and wave renewable energy endowment (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Sierra et al., 2017; Craig et al., 2018; Devis et al., 2018; Tobin et al., 2018; Yalew et al., 2020). D. Li et al. (2020) and Karnauskas et al. (2018a)  evaluated wind thresholds at turbine height (about 80–100 m above ground) including periods outside of cut-in (2.5–3 m s–1) and cut-out (about 25 m s–1) levels beyond which given turbines could not operate.
