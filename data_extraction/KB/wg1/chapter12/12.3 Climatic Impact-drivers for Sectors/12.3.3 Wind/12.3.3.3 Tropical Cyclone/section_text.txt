Tropical cyclones and severe coastal storms can deliver wind, water and coastal hazards with the potential for widespread mortality and damages to cities, housing, transportation and energy infrastructure, ecosystems and agricultural lands (Burkett, 2011; NASEM, 2012; Bell et al., 2013; Wehof et al., 2014; Ward et al., 2016; Cheal et al., 2017; Godoi et al., 2018; Koks et al., 2019; Pinnegar et al., 2019). Storm planning is often tied to the Saffir –Simpson scale related to peak sustained wind speed (Izaguirre et al., 2021), with several indices focusing on storms’ overall power and energy, size and translation speed to anticipate destructive potential (Knutson et al., 2015; Wang and Toumi, 2016; Parker et al., 2018; Hassanzadeh et al., 2020).
