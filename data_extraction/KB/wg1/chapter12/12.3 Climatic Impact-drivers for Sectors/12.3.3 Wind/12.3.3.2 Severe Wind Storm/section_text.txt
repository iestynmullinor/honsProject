High winds associated with severe storms can destroy trees and houses, break plant stems and knock fruits, nuts and grains to the ground, with tolerance thresholds depending on crop species and developmental stage (Seidl et al., 2017; Lai, 2018; Elsner et al., 2019; Grotjahn, 2021). Severe storms particularly threaten energy infrastructure, with maximum wind speed associated with treefall and breaking of above-ground electrical transmission lines (Ward, 2013; Nik et al., 2020). The profile of heavy wind gusts is also required in the design of skyscrapers (C.-H. Wang et al., 2013) and bridges (Mondoro et al., 2018). Severe storms are difficult to simulate at the relatively coarse spatial scales of Earth system models, thus scientists often project changes by noting areas with increased convective available potential energy (CAPE) and strong low-level wind shear as these are conducive to tornado formation (Diffenbaugh et al., 2013; Tippett et al., 2016; Glazer et al., 2021).
