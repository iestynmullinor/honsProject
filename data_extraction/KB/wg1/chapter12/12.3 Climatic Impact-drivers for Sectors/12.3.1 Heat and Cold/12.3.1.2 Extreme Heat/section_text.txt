Impacts and risk assessments utilize a large variety of indices and approaches tailored to evaluate heat impacts on human health (Sanderson et al., 2017; C. Gao et al., 2018; McGregor and Vanos, 2018; Staiger et al., 2019; J. Zhu et al., 2019; Schwingshackl et al., 2021). A mixture of simple and complex heat stress indices often combine extreme temperatures and high humidity to capture human health challenges (Aström et al., 2013; Chow et al., 2016; Dahl et al., 2017a; Im et al., 2017; Coffel et al., 2018; J. Li et al., 2018; Vanos et al., 2020). Different optimum temperatures and extreme heat thresholds based on local distributions are needed to reflect acclimation of different locations and populations (Hajat et al., 2014; WHO, 2014; Kinney et al., 2015b; Russo et al., 2015; Petitti et al., 2016; Dosio, 2017; Cheng et al., 2018; Lay et al., 2018; Schwingshackl et al., 2021). Hot and humid heat episodes can be deadly (Mora et al., 2017), are associated with elevated hospital intake (Goldie et al., 2017) and lower safety and productivity of outdoor labourers (Dunne et al., 2013; Graff Zivin and Neidell, 2014; Kjellstrom et al., 2016; Pal and Eltahir, 2016; Y. Zhao et al., 2016; Mora et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2018; Orlov et al., 2019). Elevated nighttime temperatures prevent the human body from experiencing relief from heat stress (Zhang et al., 2012) and can be tracked over extended periods of sequential day and night heat extremes (Murage et al., 2017; Mukherjee and Mishra, 2018). Extreme heat also exacerbates asthma, respiratory difficulties and response to airborne allergens such as hay fever (Upperman et al., 2017). Extreme heat affects outdoor exercise such as the use of bike-share facilities (Heaney et al., 2019; Vanos et al., 2020). Large-scale recreational and sporting events such as marathons and tennis tournaments monitor heat extremes when determining the viability of host cities (Smith et al., 2016, 2018).Short-term exposure of crops to temperatures beyond a critical temperature threshold can lead to lower yields and above a limiting temperature threshold, crops may fail altogether (Schlenker and Roberts, 2009; Lobell et al., 2012, 2013; Gourdji et al., 2013; Deryng et al., 2014; Schauberger et al., 2017; Tesfaye et al., 2017; Vogel et al., 2019). The exact level of these thresholds depends on species, cultivar and farm management (Hatfield and Prueger, 2015; Hatfield et al., 2015; Bisbis et al., 2018; Grotjahn, 2021). The timing of heatwaves is particularly important, as extreme heat is more damaging during critical phenological stages (Teixeira et al., 2013; Eyshi Rezaei et al., 2015; Fontana et al., 2015; B. Wang et al., 2017; Mäkinen et al., 2018). Extreme canopy temperatures, rather than 2 m air temperatures, may be a more robust biophysical indicator of heat impacts on crop production (Siebert et al., 2017). Heat stress indices based upon temperature and humidity determine livestock productivity as well as conception and mortality rates (Key et al., 2014; Dash et al., 2016; Pragna et al., 2016; Rojas-Downing et al., 2017).Heat extremes factor in mortality, morbidity and the range of some thermally sensitive ecosystem species (Smith and Nagy, 2015; Ratnayake et al., 2019; Thomsen et al., 2019). Combined heat and drought stress can reduce forest and grassland primary productivity (Ciais et al., 2005; De Boeck et al., 2018) and even cause tree mortality at higher extremes (Teskey et al., 2015).Extreme heat events raise temperatures in buildings and cities already warmed by the urban heat island effect (Gaffin et al., 2012; Oleson et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Mauree et al., 2019; Box 10.3) and can induce disruptions in critical infrastructure networks (Chapman et al., 2013). Heat affects transportation infrastructure by warping roads and airport runways (Chinowsky and Arndt, 2012) or buckling railways (Dobney et al., 2010; Dépoues, 2017; Chinowsky et al., 2019), and high temperatures reduce air density leading to aircraft take-off weight restrictions (Coffel et al., 2017; Palko, 2017; T. Zhou et al., 2018). Heat extremes increase peak cooling demand and challenge transmission and transformer capacity (Sathaye et al., 2013; Russo et al., 2016; Craig et al., 2018; X. Gao et al., 2018) and may cause transmission lines to sag or fail (Gupta et al., 2012). Thermal and nuclear electricity plants may be challenged when using warmer river waters for cooling or when mixing waste waters back into waterways without causing ecosystem impacts (Kopytko and Perkins, 2011; van Vliet et al., 2016; Tobin et al., 2018). Extreme temperature can also reduce photovoltaic panel efficiency (Jerez et al., 2015).
