The magnitude and timing (relative to developmental stages) of cold extremes (such as the typical coldest day of the year) set limits in the range of species habitat for ecosystems as well as for agricultural and forest pests (Osland et al., 2013; Cavanaugh et al., 2014; Parker and Abatzoglou, 2016; Brunner et al., 2018; Unterberger et al., 2018). Cold air outbreaks can lead to chilling injuries for crops (even above 0°C) and may kill outdoor livestock (particularly young animals; Mader et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013; Grotjahn, 2021), but are often necessary for crop chill requirements (Dennis and Peacock, 2009).Increases in human mortality can occur on exceptionally cold days (e.g., <1st percentile of temperatures in winter) although thresholds and human-perceived temperatures linked to wind speed (i.e., ‘wind chill’) vary geographically due to acclimatization (Li et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2015; J. Li et al., 2018; J. Zhu et al., 2019). The timing of ‘unseasonal’ cold spells also affect human health (Kinney et al., 2015b). Extreme cold can increase heat and electricity demand (Stuivenvolt-Allen and Wang, 2019), cause water pipes to burst, and mechanically alter roads, railroads and buildings (Underwood et al., 2017).
