Episodic coastal flooding of coastal communities, farmland, buildings, transportation routes, industry and other infrastructure is caused by extreme total water levels (ETWL), which is the combination of RSL, tides, storm surge and high wave setup at the shoreline (Vitousek et al., 2017; Melet et al., 2018; Vousdoukas et al., 2018, 2020a; Koks et al., 2019; Kirezci et al., 2020). Coastal settlement and infrastructure design often uses coastal flooding metrics such as the ETWL frequency distribution or the 100-year average return interval storm tide (storm surge + high tide) level (McInnes et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016; Walsh et al., 2016b; Zheng et al., 2017). The duration of floods that overtop coastal protection, due to extreme coastal water levels (ECWL), is important for port and harbour operations and coastal energy infrastructure thresholds (Bilskie et al., 2016; Camus et al., 2017). Frequent inundation by salt water can also have significant impacts on water resources, crops, aquaculture and transportation systems due to corrosion and undercutting of coastal roads, bridges and rails (Zimmerman and Faris, 2010; N. Ahmed et al., 2019; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019).
