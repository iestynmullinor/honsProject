Effective management of coastal ecosystems, cities, settlements, beaches and infrastructure requires information about coastal erosion driven by storm surge, waves and sea level rise (Dawson et al., 2009; Hinkel et al., 2013; Harley et al., 2017; Mentaschi et al., 2017). Coastal erosion is generally accompanied by shoreline retreat, which can occur as a gradual process (e.g., due to sea level rise) or as an episodic event due to storm surge and/or extreme waves, especially when combined with high tide (Ranasinghe, 2016). The most commonly used shoreline retreat index is the magnitude of shoreline retreat by a pre-determined planning horizon such as 50 or 100 years into the future. Commonly used metrics for episodic coastal erosion include the beach erosion volume due to the 100-year recurrence storm wave height, the full exceedance probability distribution of coastal erosion volume (Li et al., 2014a; Pender et al., 2015; Ranasinghe and Callaghan, 2017) and the cumulative storm energy and storm power index (Godoi et al., 2018). The destruction or overtopping of barrier islands may lead to irreversible changes in the physical system as well as in coastal ecosystems (Carrasco et al., 2016; Zinnert et al., 2019). Shoreline position change rates along inlet-interrupted coasts may also be affected by changes in river flows and fluvial sediment supply (Hinkel et al., 2013; Bamunawala et al., 2018; Ranasinghe et al., 2019). Permafrost thaw and Arctic sea ice decline also reduce natural coastal protection from wave erosion for communities and industry (Forbes, 2011; Melvin et al., 2017).
