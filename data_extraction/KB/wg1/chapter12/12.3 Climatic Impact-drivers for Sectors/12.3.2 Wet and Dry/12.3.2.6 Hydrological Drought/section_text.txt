Water managers often utilize a variety of hydrological drought indices and hydrological models to characterize water resources, low flow conditions and the potential for irrigation (Wanders and Wada, 2015; Mukherjee et al., 2018). Low flow volume and intermittency thresholds can indicate reductions in dissolved oxygen, more concentrated pollutants, and higher stream temperatures relevant for ecosystems, water resource quality and thermal power plant cooling (Feeley et al., 2008; DÃ¶ll and Schmied, 2012; Schaeffer et al., 2012; Prudhomme et al., 2014; van Vliet et al., 2016). Low water levels may also restrict waterway navigation for commerce and recreation (Forzieri et al., 2018).
