Landslides, mudslides, rockfalls and other mass movements can lead to fatalities, destroy infrastructure and housing stock, and block critical transportation routes. Climate models cannot resolve these complex slope failure processes (nor triggering mechanisms such as earthquakes), so most studies rely on proxies or conditions conducive to slope failure (Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016; Ho et al., 2017). Common indices include precipitation intensity-duration thresholds (Brunetti et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2012; Melchiorre and Frattini, 2012) and thresholds related to antecedent wet periods and extreme rainfall intensities (Alvioli et al., 2018; Monsieurs et al., 2019). Landslides and rockfalls may also be exacerbated by permafrost thaw and receding glaciers in polar and mountain areas (Cook et al., 2016; Haeberli et al., 2017; Patton et al., 2019).
