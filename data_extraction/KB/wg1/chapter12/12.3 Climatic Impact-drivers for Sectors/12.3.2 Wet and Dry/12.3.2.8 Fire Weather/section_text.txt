Complex fire weather indices shed light on conditions that increase the likelihood of wildfire and shifts in the fire season (Flannigan et al., 2013; Bedia et al., 2015; Jolly et al., 2015; Harvey, 2016; Littell et al., 2016; Westerling, 2016; Abatzoglou et al., 2019), which pose particularly acute challenges for indigenous communities (Christianson and McGee, 2019). Projection of future lightning frequency provides information on an important natural triggering mechanism, particularly when coupled with long-term warming and drying trends (Romps et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2015; Veraverbeke et al., 2017). Fuel aridity metrics also help determine vegetative fuel desiccation and therefore the ignitability, flammability and spread of fires when they occur (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016). The presence of snow cover can influence the length of the fire season and the penetration of fire danger into new portions of the Arctic tundra (Young et al., 2017; Abatzoglou et al., 2019). Data on the changing characteristics of local wind circulations like the Santa Ana in California shed light on future intensity and spread patterns for fires (Jin et al., 2015). Fires also produce smoke plumes that reduce air and water quality (via deposition), adversely affecting health, visibility and water resources both near and far downwind (Dennekamp and Abramson, 2011; McKenzie et al., 2014; Dreessen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Martin, 2016).
