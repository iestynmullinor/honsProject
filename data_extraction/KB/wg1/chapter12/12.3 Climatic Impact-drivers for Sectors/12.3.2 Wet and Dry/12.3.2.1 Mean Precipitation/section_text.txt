Changes in mean precipitation alter total water resources and long-term surface, snowpack and groundwater reservoirs (Schewe et al., 2014). Annual and seasonal wet trends can alter the suitable geographic range of species, with implications for biodiversity and vector-borne diseases (Knouft and Ficklin, 2017; Smith et al., 2020). The rate at which higher total streamflow increases river erosion and changes sediment loading is relevant for fish breeding (Scheurer et al., 2009), the location of riverine salt fronts that affect coastal agriculture and ecosystems (Chun et al., 2018; Vu et al., 2018), coastal freshwater stratification (Baker-Austin et al., 2013; Bell et al., 2013), and the accretion of sediment in estuaries and beaches (Syvitski and Milliman, 2007). Wetter conditions may shift tourist appeal (Kovács et al., 2017) and alter the pace of degradation for paved and especially unpaved roads (Chinowsky and Arndt, 2012).Many agricultural systems require minimum rainfall totals or rely upon irrigation (Mbow et al., 2019). The length of the wet season helps determine the potential for multiple cropping seasons, but inconsistency of wet season arrival times poses challenges for farm management (Waha et al., 2020). Wetter growing season conditions increase the chance of waterlogging, which can delay planting or damage planted seeds (Rosenzweig et al., 2002; Ben-Ari et al., 2018; Mäkinen et al., 2018; Wolfe et al., 2018; Kolberg et al., 2019; Grotjahn, 2021). Tomasek et al. (2017) calculated ‘workable days’ for agricultural machinery around planting and harvest time set in part by limits in soil moisture saturation below which farmers can utilize critical machinery with less rutting or soil compaction. Wetter conditions may also increase canopy moisture that is conducive to crop pathogens (Garrett et al., 2006; Kilroy, 2015; Grotjahn, 2021).
