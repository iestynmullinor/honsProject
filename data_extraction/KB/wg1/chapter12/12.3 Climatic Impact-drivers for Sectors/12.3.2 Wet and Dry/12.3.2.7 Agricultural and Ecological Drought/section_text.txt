Agricultural and ecological drought indices relate to the ability of plants to meet growth and transpiration needs (Table 11.3; Zargar et al., 2011; Lobell et al., 2015; Pedro-Monzonís et al., 2015; Bachmair et al., 2016; Wehner et al., 2017; Naumann et al., 2018) and the timing and duration of droughts can lead to substantially different impacts (Peña-Gallardo et al., 2019). Drought stress for agriculture and ecosystems is difficult to directly observe, and therefore scientists use a variety of drought indices (Table 11.3), proxy information about changes in precipitation supply and reference evapotranspiration demand, the ratio of actual/potential evapotranspiration or a deficit in available soil water content, particularly at rooting level (Park Williams et al., 2013; Trnka et al., 2014; C.D. Allen et al., 2015; Svoboda and Fuchs, 2017; Mäkinen et al., 2018; Otkin et al., 2018). Severe water stress can lead to crop failure, in particular when droughts persist for an extended period or occur during key plant developmental stages (Hatfield et al., 2014; Jolly et al., 2015; Leng and Hall, 2019). Projections of high wind speed and low humidity (even for just a portion of the day) can also inform studies examining fruit desiccation and rice cracking (Grotjahn, 2021). Drought also raises disease infection rates for West Nile virus (Paull et al., 2017), and the alternation of dry and wet spells induces swelling and shrinkage of clay soils that can lead to sinkholes and destabilize buildings (Hadji et al., 2014).
