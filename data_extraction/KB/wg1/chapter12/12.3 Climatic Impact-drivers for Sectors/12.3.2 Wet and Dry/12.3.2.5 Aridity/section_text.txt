Aridity indices may track long-term changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration demand, surface water, groundwater or soil moisture (Sherwood and Fu, 2014; Herrera-Pantoja and Hiscock, 2015; B.I. Cook et al., 2020). Changes in soil moisture and surface water can shift the rate of carbon uptake by ecosystems (Humphrey et al., 2018) and alter suitable climate zones for wild species and agricultural cultivation (Feng and Fu, 2013; Garcia et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2016a; Schlaepfer et al., 2017; Fatemi et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019c) as well as the prevalence of related pests and pathogen-carrying vectors (Paritsis and Veblen, 2011; Smith et al., 2020). Water table depth, in relation to rooting depth, is also important for farms and forests under dry conditions (Feng et al., 2006). A reduction in water availability (via aridity or hydrological drought) challenges water supplies needed for for municipal, industrial, agriculture and hydropower use (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Schewe et al., 2014; Gosling and Arnell, 2016; van Vliet et al., 2016).
