Heavy downpours can lead to pluvial flooding in cities, roadways, farmland, subway tunnels and buildings (particularly those with basements; Grahn and Nyberg, 2017; Palko, 2017; Pregnolato et al., 2017; Orr et al., 2018). Heavy precipitation may overwhelm city transportation and storm water drainage systems, which are typically designed using intensity-duration-frequency information such as the return periods for 1-, 6- or 24-hour rainfall totals (Kermanshah et al., 2017; Depietri and McPhearson, 2018; Rosenzweig et al., 2018; Courty et al., 2019). Heavy rain events can directly cause leaf loss and damage, or knock over crops, also driving pollutant entrainment and erosion hazards in terrestrial ecosystems and farmland, with downstream ramifications for water quality (Hatfield et al., 2014; Segura et al., 2014; Li and Fang, 2016; Chhetri et al., 2019). The proportion of total precipitation that falls in heavy events also affects the percentage that is retained in the soil column, altering groundwater recharge and deep soil moisture content for agricultural use (Fishman, 2016; Lesk et al., 2020).
