A large variety of climate indices and models are utilized to understand how river flooding affects both natural or built environments with highly variable hazard thresholds, given unique local topography and engineered defences such as dams and polders (Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Ekström et al., 2018). Key transportation routes, built infrastructure and agricultural lands are threatened when floods exceed design standards commonly based around flood magnitudes of a given historic return period (e.g., 1-in-100-year flood event), an annual exceedance probability or precipitation intensity-duration-frequency relationships with key indices (e.g., 10-day cumulative precipitation) related to catchment size and properties (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes, 2014; Kundzewicz et al., 2014; Arnell and Gosling, 2016; Dikanski et al., 2016; Gosling and Arnell, 2016; Forzieri et al., 2017; Fluixá-Sanmartín et al., 2018; Koks et al., 2019). Floods and high-flow events can scour river beds and elevate silt loads, reducing water quality and accelerating deposition in estuaries and reservoirs (Khan et al., 2018; Parasiewicz et al., 2019). Floods can knock down, drown or wash away crops and livestock, and partially submerged plants can have yield reduction depending on water turbidity and their development stage (Ruane et al., 2013; Shrestha et al., 2019). Basin snowpack properties may also be important during heavy rain events, as rain-on-snow events can lead to rapid acceleration of flood stages that threaten wildlife and society (Hansen et al., 2014).
