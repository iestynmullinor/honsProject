Snow and glacier: African glaciers are located in East Africa and more specifically on Mount Kenya, the Rwenzori Mountains and Mount Kilimanjaro, with glaciers reducing substantially in each region (high confidence) (Taylor et al., 2006; Cullen et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2018; Prinz et al., 2018; Wang and Zhou, 2019). Observation and future projection of African glacier mass changes are assessed in Section 9.5.1 within the low-latitude glacier region, which is one of the regions with the largest mass loss even under low-emissions scenarios (assessment of this region is dominated by glaciers in the South American Andes, however) (high confidence). Glaciers in the low-latitude region will lose 67 ± 42%, 86 ± 24% and 94 ± 13% of their mass by the end of the century for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively (Marzeion et al., 2020). Cullen et al. (2013) calculated that even imbalances between the Mount Kilimanjaro glaciers and present-day climate would be enough to eliminate the mountain’s glaciers by 2060. Snow water equivalent and snow cover season duration also decline in the East African mountains, Ethiopian Highlands and Atlas Mountains with climate change (high confidence) (López-Moreno et al., 2017).In conclusion, there is  high confidence that African snow and glaciers have very significantly decreased in the last decades and that this trend will continue over the 21st century.
