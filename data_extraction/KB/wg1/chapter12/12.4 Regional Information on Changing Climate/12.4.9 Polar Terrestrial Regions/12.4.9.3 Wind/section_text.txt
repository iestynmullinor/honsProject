Mean wind speed and severe storm: There is medium confidence of mean wind decrease over the Russian Arctic, Greenland and Iceland, and Arctic North-Eastern North America (Karnauskas et al., 2018a; Jung and Schindler, 2019), but low confidence of changes in the other Arctic regions and Antarctica. Bintanja et al. (2014) projected that a strengthening of the Southern Annular Mode would decrease easterlies along Antarcticaâ€™s coasts with only small changes in katabatic winds (although this effect may diminish with stratospheric ozone recovery). In contrast, Gorter et al. (2014) regional climate model projections indicated a reduction in mean winds over the interior of Greenland by RCP4.5 2100 while coastal winds increase. Reanalysis data and climate models indicate few coherent regional trends of polar cyclone frequency or relationships with cyclone depth and size (Akperov et al., 2018, 2019; Day and Hodges, 2018; Zahn et al., 2018).
