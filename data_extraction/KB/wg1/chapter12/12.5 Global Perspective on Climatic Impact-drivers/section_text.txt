Ruane (United States of America), Sonia I. Seneviratne (Switzerland), Jana Sillmann (Norway/Germany), Sophie Szopa (France), Prodromos Zanis (Greece)A consistent risk framework (Reisinger et al., 2020) has been adopted across the three Working Groups (WGs) in IPCC AR6 while recognizing the diversity of risk concepts across disciplines. WGI is assessing changes in climatic impact-drivers (CIDs), which are physical climate system conditions (e.g., means, events and extremes) that affect an element of society or ecosystems. Depending on system tolerance, CIDs and their changes can be detrimental, beneficial, neutral, or a mixture of each across interacting system elements and regions (Sections 12.1–12.3). In the assessment of Representative Key Risk (RKR) categories and Reasons for Concern (RFCs) in WGII Chapter 16, the focus lies on the adverse consequences of climate change, for which many types of CIDs (i.e., ‘hazards’ in the context of identified risks) play a key role. This box synthesizes the assessment of such hazards according to global warming levels (GWLs) from various chapters of WGI to inform understanding of their potential changes and associated risks with temperature levels in general, and in particular to facilitate WGII integrated assessments of RKRs and RFCs. Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, connects the organization of regional information according to GWLs to the other common dimension along which future projections are organized: that is, scenarios. Section 1.6 describes all dimensions of integration adopted in this Report, adding cumulative carbon emissions to GWLs and scenarios.Eight RKRs are identified within WGII Chapter 16:RKR-A: risk to the low-lying coastal socio-ecological systems;RKR-B: risk to terrestrial and ocean ecosystems;RKR-C: risks associated with critical physical infrastructure, networks and services;RKR-D: risk to living standards;RKR-E: risk to human health;RKR-F: risk to food security;RKR-G: risk to water security; andRKR-H: risks to peace and to human mobility.RFCs further synthesize the landscape of risks from climatic changes into five categories (from the IPCC Third Assessment Report onward; Smith et al., 2001):RFC1: risks to unique and threatened systems;RFC2: risks associated with extreme weather events;RFC3: risks associated with the distribution of impacts;RFC4: risks associated with global aggregate impacts; andRFC5: risks associated with large-scale singular events.Importantly, the assessment of risk in WGII considers hazards as only one component of an integrated assessment that involves their complex interaction with exposure and vulnerability of the systems at risk (Reisinger et al., 2020).Hazards relevant to RKRs and RFCs are identified among aspects of the climate system that have an episodic, short-term nature, like extreme events (particularly relevant to RFC2 but contributing to many other risk categories). Increasing GWLs translate into changing characteristics of frequency, duration, intensity, seasonality and spatial extent for many of these hazards that are also apparent in scenario-based results (Chapters 11 and 12, and Sections 12.4 and 12.5.1). Other relevant hazards coincide with long-term trends embodying a gradual change that may result in unfavourable environmental conditions. Also, increasing GWLs increase the likelihood of compound temporal or spatial occurrence of similar or different hazards (Section 11.8). Furthermore, RFC5’s focus on singular events includes concern surrounding potential tipping points and irreversible behaviour in the physical climate system.Cross-Chapter Box 12.1, Table 1 organizes information by hazard and presents current state and future change assessments with increasing GWLs (defined by increasing global surface air temperature, GSAT; see Cross-Chapter Box 2.3). We draw on individual chapters across the WGI report for the assessment of how these hazards vary with GWL. Hazards for which a relation to GWLs has not been assessed are not reported in the table.Cross-Chapter Box 12.1 Cross-Chapter Box 12.1, Table 1 | Summary of CIDs/hazards that are identified as driving RKRs and RFCs.  The behaviour of each (in most cases considered at the global scale, but for some types in terms of spatially resolved patterns) as a function of GWLs is described and when possible quantified, together with the level of confidence of the assessment, to be found in more detail in the chapter/sections indicated in the corresponding column. For the relation with GSAT levels, two columns detail current state, which can be associated to about 1°C of global warming, and future behaviour. Tipping Points and Irreversibility are comprehensively assessed with CMIP6 models up to GWL = 3°C, with fewer studies and lower confidence at higher GWLs up to 5°C.Hazard CategorySub-categoryRKR/RFC RelevanceBehaviour at About 1°C (Present) Behaviour as a Function of GWL (Future) WGI Chapter ReferencesExtreme EventsHot and Cold ExtremesAll RKRs; RFC2, RFC3Frequency and intensity of hot extremes increased and cold extremes decreased at the global scale and in most regions since 1950 (GSAT change about 0.6°C) (virtually certain). Number of warm days and nights increased; intensity and duration of heatwaves increased; number of cold days and nights decreased (virtually certain). Regional-to-continental scale trends generally consistent with global-scale trends (high confidence). Limited data in a few regions (especially Africa) hampers trend assessment.Strong linear relation between magnitude and intensity of heat and cold extremes and GSAT, detectable from warming as low as 1.5°C; changes in the extreme metrics twice as large (in mid-latitude regions) or more (in high-latitude regions) than GSAT warming (very likely) ; metrics related to frequency of exceedance may show stronger than linear relationships (exponential) (very likely) . Compared to today, changes in extremes at +2°C at least two times larger than at +1.5°C, and four times larger at +3°C.Sections 11.3, 11.9, 12.4; Figures 11.3, 11.4, 11.6, 11.11, 11.12; Table 11.2.Extreme Precipitation EventsAll RKRs; RFC2, RFC3Frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events increased at the global scale over a majority of land regions with good observational coverage (high confidence) and at the continental scale in North America, Europe and Asia. Larger percentage increases in heavy precipitation observed in the northern high latitudes in all seasons, and in the mid-latitudes in the cold season (high confidence). Regional increases in the frequency and/or intensity of heavy rainfall also observed in most parts of Asia, north-west Australia, northern Europe, South-Eastern South America, and most of the USA (high confidence), and West and Southern Africa, Central Europe, the eastern Mediterranean region, Mexico, and North-Western South America (medium confidence). GHGs likely  the main cause.Precipitation events – including those associated with tropical cyclones (TCs) – increase with GSAT. For GWLs >2°C very rare (e.g., 1-in-10 or more years) heavy precipitation events more frequent and more intense over all continents (virtually certain) and nearly all AR6 regions (likely) . Likelihood lower at lower GWLs and for less-rare events. At the global scale, intensification of heavy precipitation generally follows Clausius–Clapeyron (about 6–7% per °C of GSAT warming;  high confidence). Increase in frequency of heavy precipitation events accelerates with warming, higher for rarer events (high confidence), with approximately a doubling and tripling frequency of 10-year and 50-year events, respectively, at 4°C of global warming.Sections 11.4, 11.7, 12.4; Figures 11.4, 11.7, 11.15, 11.16; Table 11.2.DroughtAll RKRs; RFC2, RFC3Increased atmospheric evaporative demand in dry seasons over a majority of land areas due to human-induced climate change (medium confidence).

Increase in the frequency and magnitude of pluvial floods (high confidence). Increasing flood potential in urban areas where heavy precipitation projected to increase, especially at high GWLs (high confidence).Sections 11.5, 12.4; Table 11.2.Tropical Cyclones (TCs)All RKRs; RFC2, RFC3Human contribution to extreme rainfall amount from specific TC events (high confidence). Global proportion of major TC intensities likely  increased over the past four decades.Increase in precipitation from TC with GSAT; average peak TC wind speeds, proportion of intense TCs, and peak wind speeds of most intense TCs increase globally with GSAT (high confidence). Decrease or lack of change in global frequency of TCs (all categories) with GSAT (medium confidence).Sections 11.7.1, 12.4; Table 11.2.Marine Heatwaves (MHWs)RKR A,B,F; RFC1,2,3High confidence that MHWs have increased in frequency over the 20th century, with an approximate doubling from 1982 to 2016, and medium confidence that they have become more intense and longer since the 1980s.MHWs very likely become 2–9 times more frequent in 2081–2100 compared to 1985–2014 under SSP1-2.6 corresponding to a GWL of 2.0 [1.3 to 2.8] °C (95% CI), or 3–15 times more frequent under SSP5-8.5 corresponding to a GWL of 4.8 [3.6 to 6.5] °C. Spatial heterogeneity with larger changes in the tropical oceans and Arctic Ocean (medium confidence).Section 12.4; Box 9.2.Concurrent Events in Time and SpaceAll RKRs; RFC2, RFC3Higher frequency already detected: more frequent concurrent heatwaves and droughts. Increased compound flooding risk (storm surge, extreme rainfall and/or river flow) in some locations; the probability of concurrent events likely  increased.Higher frequency with increasing GSAT. Increasing trend in more frequent concurrent heatwaves and droughts with GSAT (high confidence). More frequent concurrent (in time) extreme events at different locations with increasing GSAT, for GWLs > 2°C (high confidence). Compound flooding risk (storm surge, extreme rainfall and/or river flow) increasing with GSAT (high confidence).Section 11.8; Table 11.2; Boxes 11.2, 11.4.TrendsFire Weather TrendsRKR-B, C; RFC1,2,3Weather conditions that promote wildfire (compound hot, dry and windy events) more probable in some regions over the last century (medium confidence).Weather conditions promoting wildfire (compound hot, dry and windy events)likely  more frequent with GSAT.Section 12.4; Table 11.2.Air Pollution WeatherRKR-E; RFC3Not discernible.Behaviour to first order controlled by emissions and policies, not by meteorology. Ozone decreases with GSAT in low-polluted regions (−0.2 to –2 ppbv per °C). Ozone increases with GSAT in regions close to sources of precursors (0.2 to 2 ppbv per °C).Sections 6.5, 12.4.Patterns of Mean WarmingRKR-B, D, F, RFC1,3,4Spatial patterns of temperature changes associated with the 0.5°C difference in GMST warming between 1991–2010 and 1960–1970 consistent with projected changes under 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming.Temperatures scale approximately linearly with GSAT, largely independently of scenario (high confidence). High latitudes of Northern Hemisphere warm faster (virtually certain). Antarctic polar amplification smaller than Arctic (high confidence). Arctic annual mean temperatures warm between 2 and 2.4 times faster for GWLs between 1.5°C and 4°C. In the Southern Hemisphere relatively high rates of warming in subtropical continental areas of South America, Southern Africa and Australia (high confidence).Sections 4.6.1.1, 12.4; Atlas; Figures 4.31, Atlas.13 and all (Atlas Sections’ figures for mean temperature changes.Arctic Warming TrendsRKR-A,C,G,H; RFC1, RFC3Emerged already from internal variability.Very likely  more pronounced (2–2.4 times faster) than the global average over the 21st century (high confidence).Sections 4.6.1, 7.4.4.1, 12.4.9 Atlas.11; Figures 4.19, 4.31, Atlas.29; Table 4.2.Patterns of Precipitation ChangeRKR-B, D, F, RFC1, RFC3Regional patterns of recent trends, over at least the past three decades, consistent with documented increase in precipitation over tropical wet regions and decrease over dry areas.Changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation and precipitation with each 0.5°C of warming (high confidence). Stable pattern of change over time and scenarios. Some departures from linearity possible at regional scale (medium confidence). Precipitation increase on land higher at 3°C and 4°C compared to 1.5°C and 2°C. Precipitation increases in large parts of the monsoon regions, tropics and high latitudes, decreases in the Mediterranean and large parts of the subtropics (high confidence).Sections 2.3.1.3.4, 4.5.1, 4.6.1, 12.4;Figures 2.15, 4.32, Atlas.13.Sea Surface Temperature (SST) WarmingRKR-A, B, D; RFC1, RFC4Increased 0.81 (0.65–0.94) per °C of GSAT (1850–1900 average compared with 2009–2018 average).Models and observations show globally averaged SSTs warming at a lower rate of about 80% that of GSAT. It is virtually certain that SST will continue to increase at a rate depending on future emissions scenario ranging from 0.4°C–1.5°C in 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014 under SSP1-2.6, corresponding to a GWL of 2.0 [1.3 to 2.8] °C, to 2°C–4°C under SSP5-8.5, corresponding to a GWL of 4.8 [3.6 to 6.5] °C.Sections 2.3.1.1.3, 9.2.1, 12.4.Ocean Acidification/pHRKR-A,B; RFC1, RFC4Virtually certaindecline of surface pH globally over the last 40 years at a rate of 0.017–0.027 pH units per decade; decline also in the subsurface over the past 2–3 decades (medium confidence). Surface pH now the lowest of at least the last 26,000 years (very high confidence).Increase of net ocean carbon flux throughout the century irrespective of the emissions scenario considered (high confidence). Decrease of ocean surface pH through the 21st century, except for SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6 where values increase slightly starting from 2070–2100 (high confidence).Sections 2.3.3.5, 4.3.2.4, 5.3.4, 5.4.2, 12.4; Figure 4.8.SPEI Index GlobalRKR-B,F,G,H; RFC39.4% chance of at least three months of drought in a year at current levels (about 1°C).Increase at the global scale in the chance of at least three months of drought in a year to about 20 [15 to 30] % at 1.5°C, 35 [20 to 45] % at 2°C to 60 [45 to 75] % at 4°C.Sections 12.4, 12.5.1.El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) VariabilityRKR-B,D,F,G; RFC2,3,5Medium confidence that both ENSO amplitude and frequency of high-magnitude events since 1950 higher than over the pre-industrial period (before 1850) but low confidence of this being outside the range of internal variability. No clear evidence shifts in ENSO or associated features or its teleconnections.No change in the amplitude of ENSO variability (medium confidence); enhanced ENSO-related variability of precipitation under SSP2-4.5 and higher (high confidence). Likelyshift eastward of the pattern of teleconnection over North Pacific and North America.Sections 2.4.2, 4.3.3.2, 4.5.3.2; Figure 4.10.Sea Ice LossRKR-A, B, H; RFC1,3,5Arctic sea ice area decreased for all months since 1970s; strongest decrease in summer (very high confidence). Arctic sea ice younger, thinner and faster moving (very high confidence). Current pan-Arctic sea ice levels unprecedented since 1850 (high confidence). Low confidence in all aspects of Antarctic sea ice prior to the satellite era. Antarctic sea ice area experienced little net change since 1979 (high confidence).The Arctic Ocean will likely become sea ice-free in September before 2050 in all considered SSP scenarios; such disappearance consistently occurring in most years at 2°C–3°C (medium confidence) and including several months in most years at 3°C–5°C (high confidence).Sections 2.3.2, 4.3.2.1, 9.3.1, 9.3.2, 12.4.9; Figures 4.2c, 4.5.Permafrost ThawRKR-A,C; RFC3,5Increases in permafrost temperatures in the upper 30 m over the past three to four decades throughout the permafrost regions (high confidence).Global permafrost volume in the top 3 m decreasing by about 25 ± 5% per °C for GWLs <4°C. Relative to 1995–2014: at 1.5°C and 2°C decreasing by less than 40% (medium confidence), at 2°C and 3°C by less than 75% (medium confidence), at 3°C and 5°C by more than 60% loss (medium confidence).Sections 2.3.2.5, 9.5.2, 12.4.9.Sea Level ChangeRKR-A,C,D,E,F,G,H; RFC1,3,4Gobal mean sea level (GMSL) is rising at an accelerated rate since the 19th century (high confidence), almost doubled during past two decades (about 0.1 mm yr–2). GMSL increase over the 20th century faster than over any preceding century in at least the last three millennia (high confidence).Up to 2050, limited scenario/GWL dependency (likely sea level rise about 0.15–0.30 m). By 2100, likely GMSL rise with respect to 1995–2014 of 0.51 (0.40–0.69) m, 0.62 (0.50–0.81) m and 0.70 (0.58–0.91) m for, respectively, GWLs of 2.0°C, 3.0°C, and 4.0°C (medium confidence). Deep uncertainty in projections for GWLs >3°C because of ice-sheet behaviour. For example, incorporation of low confidence ice-sheet processes under SSP5-8.5 (approximately 5°C) leads to a rise of 0.6-1.6 m rather than 0.7–1.1 m.Sections 9.6.1.2, 9.6.3.3, 9.6.3.4, 12.4.Sea-Level Change Commitment (2,000 years after peak GWL)RFC5GMSL commitment (over the 2000-year-long period following peak warming) of 2–6 m for 2°C peak warming, 4–10 m for 3°C peak warming, 12–16 m for 4°C peak warming, and 19–22 m for 5°C peak warming (medium agreement, limited evidence).Section 9.6.3.5.Northern Hemisphere (NH) Spring Snow CoverRKR-G, RFC1,3Substantial reductions in spring snow cover extent in the NH since 1978 (very high confidence). Since 1981, general decline in NH spring snow water equivalent (high confidence).Linear change of NH snow cover in spring of about 8% (area) per °C ofglobal warming (for GWLs <4°C). Relative to 1995–2014: at 1.5°C–2°C NH spring snow cover extent likely decreases by less than 20% (medium confidence); at 2°C–3°C likely decreases by less than 30%; at 3°C–5°C, likely decreases by more than 25%.Sections 2.3.2.2,9.5.3, 12.4.Mass Loss of GlaciersRKR-B,G; RFC1, RFC3Very high confidence global glaciers continuing retreat since about 1850. Current global glacier mass loss highly unusual over at least the last 2000 years (medium confidence). Increased rate of glacier mass loss over the last 3 to 4 decades (high confidence). Glaciers not in balance with respect to current climate conditions and will continue to lose mass for at least several decades.For 1.5°C–2°C about 50–60% (low confidence) of glacier mass outside the two ice sheets and excluding peripheral glaciers in Antarctica remaining, predominantly in the polar regions. At 2°C–3°C about 40–50% (low confidence) of current glacier mass outside Antarctica remaining. At sustained 3°C–5°C 25–40% (low confidence) of current glacier mass outside Antarctica remaining. Likely nearly all glacier mass lost in low latitudes, Central Europe, Caucasus, western Canada and USA, North Asia, Scandinavia and New Zealand.Sections 2.3.2.3, 9.5.1, 12.4.Tipping Points/IrreversibilityAmazon Forest DiebackRFC1, RFC5Highly dependent on human disturbance.Amazon drying and deforestation expected to cause a rapid change in the regional water cycle, possibly linked to the crossing of a climate threshold. Low confidence change will occur by 2100.Sections 5.4.9, 8.6.2.1, 12.4.10; Table 4.10.Boreal Forest DiebackRFC1, RFC5Highly dependent on human disturbance.Possible if climate threshold is exceeded, but counteracted by poleward expansion.Section 5.4.9.Ice SheetsRFC5Greenland Ice Sheet mass-loss rate increased substantially since the turn of the 21st century (high confidence). The Antarctic Ice Sheet has lost mass between 1992 and 2017 (very high confidence), with an increasing mass-loss rate over this period (medium confidence).At sustained warming levels between 1.5°C and 2°C, the ice sheets will continue to lose mass (high confidence); on time scales of multiple centuries, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will partially be lost (medium confidence); there is limited evidence that the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia; at sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C, there is limited evidence that the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia, and  high confidence in increasing risk of complete loss and increasing rate of mass loss for higher warming; At sustained warming levels between 3°C and 5°C, near-complete loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet and complete loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will occur irreversibly over multiple millennia (medium confidence); substantial parts or all of Wilkes Subglacial Basin in East Antarctica will be lost over multiple millennia (low confidence).Sections 2.3.2.4,9.4.1, 9.4.2; Table 4.10.GlaciersRFC5See Trends section of this table.Continuing substantial global mass loss.Sections 9.5.1, 12.4.9.Global Ocean TemperatureRFC5See Trends section of this table.Centennial-scale irreversibility of ocean warming.Sections 4.7.2, 9.6.3; Table 4.10.Sea Level Rise (SLR)RFC5See Trends section of this table.Centennial-scale irreversibility of sea level rise.

Observed decline since the mid-2000s cannot be distinguished from internal variability (high confidence).There is medium confidence an abrupt collapse will not occur before 2100; for 1.5–2°C, 2–3°C, 3–5°C warming in 2100, AMOC decline is 29, 32 and 39%, respectively, of its pre-industrial strength.Sections 2.3.3.4.1,9.2.3.1; Table 4.10.Permafrost CarbonRFC5See Trends section of this table.Will contribute as a feedback with warming, of approximately 18 ± 12 PgC per °C.
