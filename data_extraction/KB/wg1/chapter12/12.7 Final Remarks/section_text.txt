The assessment in this chapter is based on a rapidly growing body of new evidence from the peer-reviewed literature, direct calculations of climate projections from several new model ensembles, and results from other AR6 WGI chapters. Although a large amount a new information on CID changes and their uptake in climate services has become available since AR5, some challenges still remain. This section summarizes some of these main challenges, with a view to facilitating improved assessments in future. The section is organized following the order of chapter sections and consolidated according to key assessment components.The adoption of the climatic impact-driver (CID) framework could benefit from stronger connections across disciplines, including between physical climate and impact scientists, and between the science community and practitioners/stakeholders on the ground. Co-development of CID index definitions with impact scientists or stakeholders helps ensure their salience and utility (Sections 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 and 12.6).The ability to project all aspects of shifting CID profiles and their effects at fine, local scales is often reliant on dynamical downscaling and additional impact modelling steps, making a robust and full quantification of the uncertainties involved more challenging. Availability of multiple models and ease of connecting physical climate models at different scales can facilitate assessment (Sections 12.2, 12.3, 12.4 and 12.5).Regional and sub-regional differences in coverage and access of homogeneous historical records, in the deployment of regional model ensembles and the exploration of scenarios, and ultimately in peer-reviewed studies addressing the full range of past and current behaviour, detection and attribution, and future projections challenge a uniformly robust assessment across all CIDs and regions of the world (Sections 12.4 and 12.5).Efforts to assess a consistent global, large-scale view of CID changes across regions and sectors would benefit from additional coordinated studies adopting common CID indices, model protocols, time horizons and scenarios or global warming levels (Sections 12.3 and 12.5).Even though the body of peer-reviewed literature regarding climate services practices and products is growing, a large part is still documented only in grey literature arising from commercial consultancy, and thus is not publicly and freely accessible (Section 12.6).
