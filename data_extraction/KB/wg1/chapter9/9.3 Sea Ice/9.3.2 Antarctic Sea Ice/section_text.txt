The SROCC assessed that observations are too sparse to reliably estimate long-term trends in Antarctic sea ice thickness. This remains true, and only qualitative statements on prevailing thicknesses are possible. Data from ICESat-1 laser altimetry (Kurtz and Markus, 2012), from Operation IceBridge (Kwok and Kacimi, 2018), and long-term shipboard observations collected in the Antarctic Sea Ice Processes and Climate (ASPeCt) dataset (Worby et al., 2008) suggest that sea ice thicker than 1 m prevails in regions of multi-year ice along the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula in the Weddell Sea, in the high-latitude embayment of the Weddell Sea, and along the coast of the Amundsen Sea, with remaining regions dominated by thinner first-year sea ice (high confidence). Regional patterns in ice thickness are affected by areas of high snow deposition and resulting snow-ice formation (Massom et al., 2001; Maksym and Markus, 2008), and deformation, ridging, and rafting that regionally cause formation of very thick sea ice (Massom et al., 2006; G. Williams et al., 2015). In addition, near ice shelves a sub-ice platelet layer from supercooled water can significantly increase sea ice thickness (Hoppmann et al., 2020; Haas et al., 2021). Regarding snow thickness, observations are too sparse in space and time to reliably estimate changes across Southern Ocean sea ice (Webster et al., 2018).There is low confidence in the long-term trend of Antarctic sea ice thickness. Both ASPeCt and ICESat-1 measurements are biased low in regions with thick ice (Kern and Spreen, 2015), compared to results from reanalyses (Massonnet et al., 2013; Haumann et al., 2016) and observations with autonomous vehicles under sea ice (G. Williams et al., 2015). Estimates of sea ice thickness from CryoSat-2 do not substantially reduce uncertainty, primarily because of the unknown snow thickness and radar scattering above the snowâ€“ice interface (Bunzel et al., 2018; Kwok and Kacimi, 2018; Kacimi and Kwok, 2020). Isolated in situ time series show no clear long-term trend in landfast ice thickness in the Weddell Sea (Arndt et al., 2020). Reanalyses suggest overall increasing sea ice thickness and volume between 1980 and 2010 (Holland et al., 2014; Zhang, 2014; Massonnet et al., 2015), while CMIP5 (Shu et al., 2015; Schroeter et al., 2018) and CMIP6 models simulate a decrease in Antarctic sea ice volume over the historical period. Because of this discrepancy, and the unclear reliability of the reanalyses (Uotila et al., 2019), there is low confidence in CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulated future Antarctic sea ice thickness.
