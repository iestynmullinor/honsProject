The SROCC highlighted that an important ongoing deficiency in projections of Antarctic sub-shelf melting is the lack of ice–ocean coupling in most continental-scale studies. Increased basal melting is mainly caused by warmer CDW (Section 9.2.2.3) on the continental shelves, and warming surface waters intruding under ice shelves (Naughten et al., 2018). Predicting whether or not open ocean water masses will freely penetrate ice shelf cavities, or will be partially blocked by ocean density gradients, is complex (Wåhlin et al., 2020); while melting related to CDW inflow is currently dominant in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, melt in other embayments is limited by deep inflows of high-salinity shelf water or seasonally warmed shallow incursions of Antarctic Surface Water (Stewart et al., 2019; Adusumilli et al., 2020). There is little consensus regarding future change in CDW (Section 9.2.2.3), and more generally low confidence in future change in the temperature of Antarctic ice-shelf cavities (Section 9.2.3.2).The response of sub-shelf melting to ocean warming is also poorly constrained. A key unknown is whether, and when, cold ice-shelf cavities might become more similar to the Amundsen Sea Embayment, not only in ocean temperature but also ice–ocean heat exchange, which depends on the cavity geometry and ocean circulation (Little et al., 2009). Only two ocean models with ice-shelf cavities have been used to make sub-shelf basal melting projections for Special Report on Emissions Scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (Hellmer et al., 2012; Timmermann and Hellmer, 2013; Timmermann and Goeller, 2017; Naughten et al., 2018). The FESOM simulation, forced by a CMIP5 multi-model mean under RCP8.5, projects a 90% increase in melting (Figure 9.19), although this could be overestimated due to an underestimation of present-day melt rates (Section 9.4.2.2; Naughten et al., 2018). The temperature–melt relationship was parameterized by ISMIP6 in terms of heat exchange velocity in m a–1, and by LARMIP-2 as basal melt sensitivity in m a–1°C–1(Box 9.3; Jourdain et al., 2020; Levermann et al., 2020; Reese et al., 2020), and both vary widely around the continent, depending on cavity type. Median values of ISMIP6 heat exchange velocity vary by a factor of 5–10 when calibrating to either mean Antarctic or high Pine Island Glacier observed melt rates (Section 9.4.2.2; Box 9.3; Jourdain et al., 2020). Basal melt sensitivities near the grounding line estimated by Reese et al. (2020) with a box model of ocean overturning range from 3.9 m a–1°C–1for the Weddell Sea to 10.5 m a–1°C–1for the Amundsen Sea region, with a continental mean of 5.3 m a–1°C–1. Similarly high Amundsen Sea sensitivities are estimated in coupled ice–ocean simulations of Thwaites Glacier (mean 9.4 m a–1°C–1; range 6–16 m a–1°C–1) (Seroussi et al., 2017). These large variations lead to large differences in basal melt rates and projected sea level contributions when applied to the whole ice sheet in ISMIP6 and LARMIP-2 (Box 9.3). Projections of melt rates from the two ISMIP6 calibrations are higher than those from FESOM, driven by a CMIP5 multi-model mean (Figure 9.19; Jourdain et al., 2020). The ISMIP6 ensemble mostly uses the mean Antarctic calibration, but includes some simulations with the Pine Island Glacier calibration, and the ISMIP6 emulator samples more of these higher values; LARMIP-2 uses basal melt sensitivities (7–16 m a–1°C–1) consistent with estimates for the Amundsen Sea Embayment. Due to the limited availability of cavity-resolving ocean models, and the wide regional variation in estimates of basal melt sensitivity to ocean temperature, there is only low confidence in projected future sub-ice-shelf melt rates. The impact of this uncertainty on AIS model projections to 2100 is discussed in Section 9.4.2.5.
