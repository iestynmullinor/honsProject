The AR5 (Church et al., 2013b) assessed the contribution from Greenland to sea level projections in 2300 as 0.15 m SLE in low-emissions scenarios (about RCP2.6) and 0.31–1.19 m in high scenarios (approximately RCP6.0/RCP8.5). The SROCC (Oppenheimer et al., 2019) did not update AR5 estimates, given limited evidence and low agreement from three new studies (Vizcaino et al., 2015; Calov et al., 2018; Aschwanden et al., 2019). Since SROCC, a new study gives a sea level contribution of 0.11 to 0.20 m in low-emissions scenarios and 0.61 to 1.29 m in high-emissions scenarios (Van Breedam et al., 2020). The low-emissions projections by Van Breedam et al. (2020) encompass AR5’s assessed contribution, while the high emissions projections are higher than that from AR5. The ‘optimal’ ensemble member of Aschwanden et al. (2019) (see also Section 9.4.1.3) indicates that Greenland could contribute 0.25 m under RCP2.6 and 1.74 m under RCP8.5. Structured expert judgement (Bamber et al., 2019) projects Greenland losses of 0.54 (0.28–1.28) m under 2°C warming and 0.97 (0.4–2.23) m under 5°C warming. These studies therefore agree that the AR5 and SROCC assessments are at the low end of the range of projections. In addition, observations suggest that Greenland Ice Sheet losses are tracking the upper range of AR5 projections (T. Slater et al., 2020). Therefore, we update the likely range for the contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet to global mean sea level (GMSL) by 2300 to 0.11–0.25 m under RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6 and 0.31–1.74 m under RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5. However, given the uncertainty in climatic drivers used to project ice-sheet change over the 21st century (Goelzer et al., 2020; Hofer et al., 2020; Noël et al., 2021) and the large range in simulations since AR5 extending beyond 2100, we only have low confidence in the contribution to GMSL by 2300 and beyond.The role of the elevation–mass feedback for future projections of Greenland can be assessed from paleo simulations. Ice-sheet model simulations of the Laurentide (Gomez et al., 2015; Gregoire et al., 2016) and Eurasian (Alvarez-Solas et al., 2019) ice sheets invoke at least some contribution to last glacial termination mass loss from SMB reduction, as a consequence of an elevation–mass balance feedback (Levermann and Winkelmann, 2016). In a model spanning Meltwater Pulse 1A, this mechanism increased mass loss by approximately 66% (Gregoire et al., 2016) but in Last Interglacial simulations, the effect of this feedback is shown to depend on the surface scheme of the climate model employed (Plach et al., 2019). Given the agreement between theoretical analyses and paleo-ice-sheet model experiments, there is  high confidence that the elevation–mass balance feedback is most relevant at multi-centennial and millennial time scales, consistent with future-focused studies (Aschwanden et al. 2019, Le Clec’h et al., 2019, Gregory et al., 2020).The SROCC adopted the AR5 assessment that complete loss of Greenland ice, contributing about 7 m to sea level, over a millennium or more would occur for a sustained global mean surface temperature (GMST) between 1°C (low confidence) and 4°C (medium confidence) above pre-industrial levels. New studies since SROCC (Gregory et al., 2020; Van Breedam et al., 2020) confirm this assessment (see also Figure 9.30). Clark et al. (2016) estimate a complete loss to take about 8000 years at 5.5°C and about 3000 years at 8.6°C. Based on the agreement between new and previous studies, there is therefore  high confidence that the rate at which Greenland Ice Sheet commitment is realized depends on the amount of warming.Accounting for more detailed feedbacks between the atmosphere and the ice sheet (Gregory et al., 2020) found a gradual relationship between sustained global mean warming and the corresponding near-equilibrium ice-sheet volume, in contrast to a sharp threshold as found by Robinson et al. (2012). Rather than a climatically controlled tipping point for irreversible loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet, Gregory et al. (2020) found a threshold of irreversibility linked to ice-sheet size, similar to previous work (Ridley et al., 2010). The results of Gregory et al. (2020) show that, if the ice sheet loses mass equivalent to about 3–3.5 m of sea level rise, it would not regrow to its present state, and 2 m of the sea level rise would be irreversible. The point in time at which the current ice sheet might reach this critical volume depends on oceanic and atmospheric conditions, ice dynamics, and climate–ice sheet feedbacks (Gregory et al., 2020; Van Breedam et al., 2020). Therefore, projections differ in the magnitude and rate of temperature change to cross the threshold for irreversible loss. Projections from a large ensemble indicate that the mass threshold may be reached in as early as 400 years under extended RCP8.5 if warming reaches 10°C or more above present levels (Aschwanden et al., 2019). In summary, there is  high confidence in the existence of threshold behaviour of the Greenland Ice Sheet in a warmer climate; however, there is low agreement on the nature of the thresholds and the associated tipping points.
