At sustained warming levels between 1.5°C and 2°C, the Arctic Ocean will become practically sea ice-free in September in some years (medium confidence); the ice sheets will continue to lose mass (high confidence), but will not fully disintegrate on time scales of multiple centuries (medium confidence); there is limited evidence that the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia; about 50 to 60% of current glacier mass excluding the two ice sheets and the glaciers peripheral to the Antarctic Ice Sheet will remain, predominantly in the polar regions (low confidence); Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover extent will decrease by up to 20% relative to 1995–2014 (medium confidence); the permafrost volume in the top 3 m will decrease by up to 50% relative to 1995–2014 (medium confidence). Committed GMSL rise over 2000 years will be about 2 to 6 m with 2°C of peak warming (medium agreement, limited evidence). {9.3.1, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.5.1, 9.5.2, 9.5.3, 9.6.3}At sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C, The Arctic Ocean will be practically sea ice free throughout September in most years (medium confidence);  there is limited evidence that the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia; both the probability of their complete loss and the rate of mass loss will increase with higher temperatures (high confidence); about 50 to 60% of current glacier mass outside Antarctica will be lost (low confidence); Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover extent will decrease by up to 30% relative to 1995–2014 (medium confidence); permafrost volume in the top 3 m will decrease by up to 75% relative to 1995–2014 (medium confidence). Committed GMSL rise over 2000 years will be about 4 to 10 m with 3°C of peak warming (medium agreement, limited evidence). {9.3.1, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.5.1, 9.5.2, 9.5.3, 9.6.3}At sustained warming levels between 3°C and 5°C, the Arctic Ocean will become practically sea ice free throughout several months in most years (high confidence); near-complete loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet and complete loss of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will occur irreversibly over multiple millennia (medium confidence); substantial parts or all of Wilkes Subglacial Basin in East Antarctica will be lost over multiple millennia (low confidence); 60 to 75% of current glacier mass outside Antarctica will disappear (low confidence); nearly all glacier mass in low latitudes, Central Europe, Caucasus, western Canada and the USA, North Asia, Scandinavia and New Zealand will likely disappear; Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover extent will decrease by up to 50% relative to 1995–2014 (medium confidence); permafrost volume in the top 3 m will decrease by up to 90% compared to 1995–2014 (medium confidence). Committed GMSL rise over 2000 years will be about 12 to 16 m with 4°C of peak warming and 19 to 22 m with 5°C of peak warming (medium agreement, limited evidence). {9.3.1, 9.4.1, 9.4.2, 9.5.1, 9.5.2, 9.5.3, 9.6.3}
