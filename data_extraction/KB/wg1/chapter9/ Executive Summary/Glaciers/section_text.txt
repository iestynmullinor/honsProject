Glaciers lost 6200 [4600 to 7800] Gt of mass (17.1 [12.7 to 21.5] mm global mean sea level equivalent) over the period 1993–2019 and will continue losing mass under all SSP scenarios (very high confidence). During the decade 2010–2019, glaciers lost more mass than in any other decade since the beginning of the observational record (very high confidence).  For all regions with long-term observations, glacier mass in the decade 2010–2019 is the smallest since at least the beginning of the 20th century (medium confidence). Because of their lagged response, glaciers will continue to lose mass at least for several decades even if global temperature is stabilized (very high confidence). Glaciers will lose 29,000 [9000 to 49,000] Gt and 58,000 [28,000 to 88,000] Gt over the period 2015–2100 for RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, respectively (medium confidence), which represents 18 [5 to 31] % and 36 [16 to 56] % of their early-21st-century mass, respectively. {2.3.2, 9.5.1, 9.6.1, 9.6.3, 12.4}
