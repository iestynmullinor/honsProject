Increases in permafrost temperature have been observed over the past three to four decades throughout the permafrost regions (high confidence), and further global warming will lead to near-surface permafrost volume loss (high confidence).  Complete permafrost thaw in recent decades is a common phenomenon in discontinuous and sporadic permafrost regions (medium confidence). Permafrost warmed globally by 0.29 [0.17 to 0.41, likely range] °C between 2007 and 2016 (medium confidence). An increase in the active layer thickness is a pan-Arctic phenomenon (medium confidence), subject to strong heterogeneity in surface conditions. The volume of perennially frozen soil within the upper 3 m of the ground will decrease by about 25% per 1°C of global surface air temperature change (up to 4°C above pre-industrial temperature) (medium confidence). {9.5.2}
