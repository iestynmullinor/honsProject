Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover extent has been decreasing since 1978 (very high confidence), and there is  high confidencethat this trend extends back to 1950. Further decrease of Northern Hemisphere seasonal snow cover extent is virtually certainunder further global warming.  The observed sensitivity of Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent to Northern Hemisphere land surface air temperature for 1981–2010 is –1.9 [–2.8 to –1.0, likely range] million km2 per 1°C throughout the snow season. It is virtually certain that Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent will continue to decrease as global climate continues to warm, and process understanding strongly suggests that this also applies to Southern Hemisphere seasonal snow cover (high confidence). Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover extent will decrease by about 8% per 1°C of global surface air temperature change (up to 4°C above pre-industrial temperature) (medium confidence). {9.5.3}
