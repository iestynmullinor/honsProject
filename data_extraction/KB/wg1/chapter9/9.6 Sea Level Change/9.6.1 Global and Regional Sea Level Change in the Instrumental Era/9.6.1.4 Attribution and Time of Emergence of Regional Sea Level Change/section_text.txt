The SROCC (Oppenheimer et al., 2019) attributed anthropogenic forcing to be the dominant cause of GMSL rise since 1970 (see also Section 3.5.3.2), but detection and attribution (Cross-Working Group Box: Attribution in Chapter 1) of 20th century externally forced regional sea level changes is more challenging, as regional variability is larger (Section 9.6.1.3), and therefore the signal-to-noise ratio is smaller (Richter and Marzeion, 2014; Monselesan et al., 2015; Palanisamy et al., 2015). Whereas SROCC assessed with  high confidence that GMSL rise is attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, they assessed with medium confidence that the regional anomalies in ocean basins are a combination of the response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and internal variability.The simulated ocean dynamic and thermosteric response to external forcings during 1861–2005 is only larger than simulated internal variability in the Southern Ocean and North Pacific on a 1° grid (Slangen et al., 2015). However, on spatial scales exceeding 2000 km, a detectable signal is revealed in the last 45 years in 63% of the global ocean area (Richter et al., 2017). The thermosteric change in the upper 700 m in the period 1970–2005 shows similar observed and simulated forced geographical patterns, and anthropogenic forcing accounts for part (North Atlantic, 65%) or all (tropical Pacific, Southern Ocean) of the observed regional mean (Marcos and Amores, 2014). The influences of greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols can be partially distinguished by considering geographical or vertical ocean temperature variations (Slangen et al., 2015; Bilbao et al., 2019; Fasullo et al., 2020). Zonal-mean forced ocean dynamic sea level change alone is not detectable but, using spatial correlation, the global geographical pattern during the altimeter period is detectable in sea level trends (Fasullo and Nerem, 2018). This patternmay already or will soon be detectable in individual years, based on an analysis of CMIP5 climate model simulations (Bilbao et al., 2015). Anthropogenic forcing, dominated by greenhouse gases, has strengthened the meridional sea level gradient in the Southern Ocean since the 1960s (Slangen et al., 2015; Bilbao et al., 2019; Fasullo et al., 2020). New evidence finds that observed zonal-mean total sea level trends during 1993–2018 in all basins are inconsistent with unforced variability alone, but are consistent with the modelled response to external forcing (Richter et al., 2020).A region that has been studied intensely in the context of sea level detection and attribution is the tropical Pacific. Observed sea level trends in the tropical Pacific show a PDO-like (Annex IV) east–west dipole (with a greater rate of rise in the west, see Section 9.6.1.3). This dipole does not occur in CMIP5 simulations with the magnitude and duration that was observed in the 1990s and 2000s, neither in response to historical forcing, nor as internal variability after removing the variability associated with the PDO (Bilbao et al., 2015). Hamlington et al. (2014) did obtain a residual trend pattern for 1993–2010 in the tropical Pacific that may link to anthropogenic warming of the tropical Indian Ocean. Allowing for PDO and ENSO variations, (Royston et al., 2018) describe patches of the Pacific Ocean where the sea level trend for 1993–2015 is distinguishable from temporally correlated noise. The acceleration in eastern Pacific sea level rise is largely accounted for by variations resembling PDO and ENSO (Hamlington et al., 2020a).In the future, the anthropogenic signal in regional sea level change from ocean density and dynamics is projected to emerge first in regions with relatively small internal variability, such as the tropical Atlantic Ocean and the tropical Indian Ocean (Jordà, 2014; Lyuet al., 2014; Richter and Marzeion, 2014; Bilbao et al., 2015). The signal is projected to emerge over 50% of the ocean area by the 2040s (Lyu et al., 2014), but in regions where variability is large and projected changes are small, such as the Southern Ocean, the signal will not emerge before late in the century. Adding the projected sea level change from land ice mass loss and groundwater extraction strengthens and modifies the forced signal, leading to times of emergence 10 to 20 years earlier in most parts of the ocean, except in regions close to sources of mass loss, with emergence over 50% of the ocean area by 2020, and nearly everywhere by 2100 (medium confidence) (Lyu et al., 2014; Richter et al., 2017).In summary, detection of forced regional changes for some ocean areas in recent decades is possible (medium confidence), but attribution of regional sea level change to forcings over longer periods (20th century) and for all ocean basins is not yet possible.
