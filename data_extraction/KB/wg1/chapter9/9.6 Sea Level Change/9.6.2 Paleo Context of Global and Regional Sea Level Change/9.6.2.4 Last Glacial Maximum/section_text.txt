At the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) geological proxies and GIA models indicate that GMSL was 125–134 m below present (Section 2.3.3.3 and Figures 9.17 and 9.18). New studies have not changed AR5’s conclusions regarding the size or timing of the LGM and last glacial termination, but have further examined the LGM sea level budget. Based on a synthesis of multiple prior studies, (Simms et al., 2019) estimated central 67% probability contributions to the LGM lowstand (i.e., lowest levels during the LGM) of 76 ± 7 m from the North American Laurentide Ice Sheet, 18 ± 5 m from the Eurasian Ice Sheet, 10 ± 2 m from Antarctica, 4 ± 1 m from Greenland, 5.5 ± 0.5 m from glaciers, and 2.4 ± 0.3 m due to an increase in ocean density. Of the residual, up to about 1.4 m may be ascribed to groundwater, leaving a shortfall of 16 ± 10 m yet to be allocated among land ice reservoirs or lakes.
