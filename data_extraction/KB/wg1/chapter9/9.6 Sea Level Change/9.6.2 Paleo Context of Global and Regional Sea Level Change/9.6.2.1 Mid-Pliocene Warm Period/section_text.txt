During the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (MPWP), GMST was 2.5°C–4°C warmer than 1850–1900 (medium confidence) and GMSL was between 5 and 25 m higher than today (medium confidence) (Table 9.6 and Section 2.3.3.3). The AR5 (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2013) concluded that ice-sheet models consistently produce near-complete deglaciation of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, and multi-meter loss of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) in response to MPWP climate conditions. Studies since AR5 have yielded a consistent but broader range, due in part to larger ensembles exploring more parameters (DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Yan et al., 2016; DeConto et al., 2021). Partly on the basis of these studies, SROCC proposed a ‘plausible’ upper bound on GMSL of 25 m (low confidence) with evidence suggesting an Antarctic contribution of anywhere between 5.4 and 17.8 m.The MPWP climate had substantial polar amplification, up to 8°C above pre-industrial levels in Arctic Russia (Section 7.4.4.1; Fischer et al., 2018). Ice-sheet model simulations indicate that Northern Hemisphere glaciation was limited to high-elevation regions in eastern and southern Greenland (medium confidence) (Figure 9.17; De Schepper et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2014; Koenig et al., 2015; Dowsett et al., 2016; Berends et al., 2019) with Northern Hemisphere glaciation only becoming more widespread from the (cooler) late Pliocene (Bachem et al., 2017; Blake-Mizen et al., 2019; Knutz et al., 2019; Sánchez-Montes et al., 2020). Southern Hemisphere glaciation was characterized by an Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) reduced in volume from the present (medium confidence) (Figure 9.18; Dowsett et al., 2016; Berends et al., 2019; Grant et al., 2019; Miller et al., 2020) with mountain ice fields in the Andes of South America (De Schepper et al., 2014). Ice-sheet models are inconsistent in the magnitude of the sea level contribution from Antarctica (DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Yan et al., 2016; Golledge et al., 2017b; Berends et al., 2019; DeConto et al., 2021) but near-field sedimentological reconstructions support precessionally modulated and eccentricity-paced multi-metre sea level contributions from the Wilkes Subglacial Basin over 3–5 kyr (Patterson et al., 2014; Bertram et al., 2018). Insummary, under a past warming level of around 2.5°C–4°C, ice sheets in both hemispheres were reduced in extent compared to present (high confidence). Proxy-based evidence (Section 2.3.3.3) combined with numerical modelling indicates that, on millennial time scales, the GMSL contribution arising from ice sheets was >5 m (high confidence) or >10 m (medium confidence) (Figures 9.17 and 9.18; Moucha and Ruetenik, 2017; Berends et al., 2019; Dumitru et al., 2019).
