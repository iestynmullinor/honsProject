The SROCC (Meredith et al., 2019) noted that Greenland may have been ice-free for extensive periods during Pleistocene interglaciations, implying a high sensitivity of the Greenland Ice Sheet to warming levels close to present day. The AR5 (Church et al., 2013b) assigned medium confidence to a Marine Isotope Stage 11 (MIS 11) GMSL of 6–15 m above present, requiring a loss of much of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, and a possible contribution from East Antarctica. High-resolution multi-proxy sea surface temperature reconstructions and climate model simulations concur that MIS 11 was an extremely long interglacial that exhibited positive annual at 0.5°C ± 1.6 °C (Irvalı et al., 2020) and summer at 2.1°C–3.4 °C (Robinson et al., 2017) temperature anomalies (de Wet et al., 2016). The GMSL was 6–13 m above present (medium confidence) (Section 2.3.3.3). The Greenland Ice Sheet lost 4.5–6 m (Reyes et al., 2014) or about 6.1 m (3.9–7 m, 95% confidence) sea level equivalent (SLE) by about 7 kyr after peak summer warmth (Robinson et al., 2017), with marine-based ice from AIS (Blackburn et al., 2020) contributing 6.4–8.8 m SLE at this time (Mas e Braga et al., 2021). Agreement between GMSL and ice-sheet reconstructions gives  high confidence in identifying a high sensitivity of both ice sheets to the protracted duration of thermal forcing, even at low warming levels (Reyes et al., 2014; Robinson et al., 2017; Irvalı et al., 2020; Mas e Braga et al., 2021). Modelled mean mass loss rates for the Greenland Ice Sheet of 0.4 m kyr–1during MIS 11 (Robinson et al., 2017) are indistinguishable from recent mass loss rates averaged over 1992–2018 (Section 9.4.1.1). In summary, geological reconstructions and numerical simulations consistently show that past warming levels of <2°C (GMST) are sufficient to trigger multi-metre mass loss from both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets if maintained for millennia (high confidence), in agreement with SROCC findings for comparable warming levels during MIS 5e, the Last Interglacial.
