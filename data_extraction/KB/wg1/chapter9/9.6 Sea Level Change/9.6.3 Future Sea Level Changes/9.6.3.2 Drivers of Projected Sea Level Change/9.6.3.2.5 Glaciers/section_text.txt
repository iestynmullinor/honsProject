In AR5 and SROCC, global glacier mass changes were derived from a power law of integrated global mean surface temperature change fit to results from four different glacier models. The updated projections use emulated GlacierMIP projections (Section 9.5.1.3; Box 9.3). Since the GlacierMIP emulator does not account for temporal correlation and terminates, along with the GlacierMIP simulations, in 2100, we employ a parametric fit to the GlacierMIP simulations, with a functional form similar to that employed by AR5, to calculate rates of change and extrapolate changes beyond 2100 (up to a maximum potential contribution of 0.32 m; see Supplementary Material 9.SM.4.5). This approach leads to a median glacier contribution that is a minimal change (Table 9.8) from AR5 and SROCC and a modest narrowing of likely ranges (Section 9.5.1.3). For RCP2.6, AR5 projected 0.10 (0.04 to 0.16, likely range) m, compared to 0.09 (0.07 to 0.11) m projected for SSP1-2.6. For RCP8.5, AR5 projected a likely contribution of 0.17 (0.09 to 0.25) m, compared to 0.18 (0.15 to 0.21) m projected here.
