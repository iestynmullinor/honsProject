Gravitational, rotational, and deformational (GRD) effects (Box 9.1) lead to distinct variations in the RSL change pattern, which are similar across a range of benchmarked GRD solvers (Martinec et al., 2018; Palmer et al., 2020). There is  high confidence in the understanding of GRD processes. RSL rise associated with GRD is very likely  to be largest in the Pacific, due to the combined effects of projected GrIS, AIS and glacier mass loss (high confidence) (e.g., Kopp et al., 2014; Slangen et al., 2014b; Larour et al., 2017; Mitrovica et al., 2018). The GRD effect associated with mass loss from an ice sheet is sensitive to the spatial distribution of that mass loss. For example, the GRD contribution to RSL rise in Australia will be larger for Antarctic mass loss sourced fromthe Antarctic Peninsula than for Antarctic mass loss sourced fromThwaites Glacier. In parts of north-eastern North America and north-western Europe, GRD effects associated with mass loss from southern Greenland will lead to an RSL fall, whereas mass loss from northern Greenland will lead to an RSL rise (high confidence) (Figure 9.26; Larour et al., 2017; Mitrovica et al., 2018). The AR5 and SROCC computed RSL patterns using a gravitationally self-consistent GRD solver given the amounts, locations and timing of the projected barystatic sea level changes driven by glaciers, ice sheets and LWS (Church et al., 2013b). A similar GRD solver is used in the updated projections (following Slangen et al., 2014b). The Earth model used is based on the Preliminary reference Earth model (PREM: Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981), and is elastic, compressible and radially stratified.
