The AR5 and SROCC projected the Greenland surface-mass balance using a cubic polynomial fit to a regional climate model as a function of global mean surface temperature (with a log-normal scaling factor reflecting uncertainty in surface-mass balance models, and another scaling factor reflecting the positive feedback of ice-sheet elevation changes on mass loss), and the dynamic contribution was estimated based on a multi-model assessment interpolated as a quadratic function of time.For processes whose projections we have at least medium confidence in, the updated projections use emulated Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6) projections of the Greenland Ice Sheet (Section 9.4.1.3; Figure 9.17; Tables 9.2 and 9.7; Box 9.3). Since the ISMIP6 emulator does not account for temporal correlation, a parametric fit to the ISMIP6 results is used to calculate rates of change (Supplementary Material 9.SM.4.4). For projections beyond 2100 (when the ISMIP6 simulations end), the polynomial fit is extrapolated based on two alternate approaches: (i) an assumption of constant rates of mass change after 2100; and (ii) for SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, a quadratic function of time extending to 2300 based on the multi-model assessment of contributions under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 at 2300 (Section 9.4.1.4). Differences between the two approaches are small up to 2150, and since the latter approach is not available for all scenarios, only the former (constant rates) is used for time series projections up to 2150. Both approaches are used for examining uncertainty in the timing of different levels of GMSL rise and to inform projections for the year 2300 (Section 9.4.1.4). For 2100, the ISMIP6 emulator yields the likely contribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet shown in Table 9.2 and Figure 9.17, representing a slight narrowing from AR5 projections.
