Neither AR5 nor SROCC discussed the sea level commitment associated with historical emissions. Since AR5, new evidence has suggested that historical emissions up to 2016 will lead to a likely committed sea level rise (i.e., the rise that would occur in the absence of additional emissions) of 0.7–1.1 m up to 2300, while pledged emissions through 2030 increase the committed rise to 0.8–1.4 m (Nauels et al., 2019).Between the baseline period (1995–2014) and 2300, AR5 projected a GMSL rise of 0.38–0.82 m under a non-specific low-emissions scenario and 0.9–3.6 m under a non-specific high-emissions scenario (Table 9.11). The SROCC projected 0.6–1.0 m under RCP2.6 and 2.3–5.3 m under RCP8.5 (low confidence). RCP-based projections for 2300 published since AR5 span a broader range, even excluding studies employing SEJ or MICI, with 17th–83rd percentile projections ranging from 0.3–2.9 m for RCP2.6 and 1.7–6.8 m for RCP8.5 (Table 9.SM.8; Kopp et al., 2014, 2017; Nauels et al., 2017, 2019; Bamber et al., 2019; Palmer et al., 2020). Conservatively extending the ISMIP6- and LARMIP-2-based projections beyond 2100 by assuming no subsequent change in ice-sheet mass flux rates (an approach similar to that adopted by Palmer et al. (2020) for the Greenland Ice Sheet and for the Antarctic Ice Sheet dynamics) leads to a GMSL change up to 2300 of 0.8–2.0 m under SSP1-2.6 and 1.9–4.1 m under SSP5-8.5 (17th–83rd percentile), while incorporating the ice-sheet contributions for 2300 assessed in Section 9.4.1.4 and Section 9.4.2.6 leads to 0.6–1.5 m and 2.2–5.9 m, respectively. Incorporating Antarctic results from a model with MICI (Section 9.4.2.4), using RCP forcing to inform SSP-based projections, leads to 1.4–2.1 m for SSP1-2.6 and 9.5–16.2 m for SSP5-8.5 (DeConto et al., 2021). Incorporating the SEJ-based ice-sheet projections of Bamber et al. (2019) for 2°C and 5°C stabilization scenarios yields 1.0–3.1 m for SSP1-2.6, and 2.4–6.3 m for SSP5-8.5, although because of the differences in scenarios, the SSP1-2.6 estimates may be overestimated and the SSP5-8.5 may be underestimated. The eightfold uncertainty range across projection methods under SSP5-8.5 reflects deep uncertainty in the multi-century response of ice sheets to strong climate forcing.Taking into account all these approaches, including published projections for RCP2.6, under SSP1-2.6 GMSL will rise between 0.3 and 3.1 m by 2300 (low confidence). This projection range indicates that, while SROCC projections under low emissions to 2300 are consistent with no ice-sheet acceleration after 2100, there is the possibility of a much broader range of outcomes at the high end, reflected in the range of published GMSL projections. Under SSP5-8.5, GMSL will rise between 1.7 and 6.8 m by 2300 in the absence of MICI and by up to 16 m considering MICI, a wider range than AR5 or SROCC assessments, but consistent with published projections (low confidence).On still longer time scales, AR5 concluded with low confidence that the multi-millennial GMSL commitment sensitivity to warming was about 1–3 m °C–1GSAT increase. Two process-model studies since AR5 (Clark et al., 2016; Van Breedam et al., 2020) indicate higher commitments (Figure 9.30). Ice sheets dominate the multi-millennial sea level commitment (Sections 9.4.1.4 and 9.4.2.6), but the two studies disagree on the relative contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Notably, processes such as MICI (Section 9.4.2.4) that are a major factor behind the deep uncertainty in century-scale AIS response do not appear to have a substantial effect on the multi-millennial magnitude (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). Only one of the studies of multimillennial GMSL commitments includes scenarios consistent with 1.5°C of peak warming (Clark et al., 2016); this study suggests a 2000-year commitment at 1.5°C of about 2.3–3.1 m, with approximately an additional 1.4–2.3 m commitment between 1.5°C and 2.0°C (i.e., about 3 to 5 m °C–1). Taken together, both studies show a 2000-year GMSL commitment of about 2–6 m for peak warming of about 2°C, 4–10 m for 3°C, 12–16 m for 4°C, and 19–22 m for 5°C (medium agreement, limited evidence) (Table 9.10). GMSL rise continues after 2000 years, leading to a 10,000-year commitment of about 6–7 m for 1.5°C of peak warming (based on Clark et al., 2016), and based on both studies of about 8–13 m for 2.0°C, 10–24 m for 3.0°C, 19–33 m for 4.0°C, and 28–37 m for 5°C (medium agreement, limited evidence) (Table 9.10).An indicative metric for the equilibrium sea level response can be provided by comparing paleo GSAT and GMSL during past multimillennial warm periods (Sections 2.3.1.1, 2.3.3.3 and 9.6.2; Figure 9.9). However, caution is needed as the present and past warm periods differ in astronomical and other forcings (Cross-chapter Box 2.1) and in terms of polar amplification. The Last Interglacial (likely 5–10 m higher GMSL than today and 0.5°C–1.5°C warmer than 1850–1900; Section 9.6.2; Table 9.6) is consistent with the Clark et al. (2016) projections for the 10,000-year commitment associated with 1.5°C of warming. Similarly, the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period (very likely 5–25 m higher GMSL than today and very likely 2.5°C–4°C warmer) (Section 9.6.2; Table 9.6) is consistent with the range of 10,000-year commitments associated with 2.5–4°C of warming, but GMSL reconstructions provide only a weak, broad constraint on model-based projections. An additional paleo constraint comes from the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, which indicates that 10–18°C of warming is associated with ice-free conditions and a likely GMSL rise of 70–76 m (Sections 2.3.3 and 9.6.2). Together with model-based projections (Clark et al., 2016; Van Breedam et al., 2020), this period suggests that commitment to ice-free conditions would occur for peak warming of about 7°C–13°C (medium agreement, limited evidence).On the basis of modelling studies, paleo constraints, single-ice-sheet studies finding multimillennial nonlinear responses from both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (Sections 9.4.1.4 and 9.4.2.6), and the underlying physics, we conclude that GMSL commitment is nonlinear in peak warming on time scales of both 2,000 and 10,000 years (medium confidence) and exceeds the AR5 assessment of 1–3 m °C–1(medium agreement, limited evidence) (Table 9.9). Although thermosteric sea level will start to decline slowly about 2,000 years after emissions cease, the slower responses from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets mean that GMSL will continue to rise for 10,000 years under most scenarios (medium confidence).Since AR5, a small number of modelling studies have examined the reversibility of the multimillennial sea level commitment under carbon dioxide (CO2) removal, solar radiation modification or local ice shelf engineering. The slow response of the deep ocean to forcing leads to global-mean thermosteric sea level fall occurring long afterward, even if CO2 levels are restored after a transient increase: global mean thermosteric sea level rise takes more than a millennium to reverse (Ehlert and Zickfeld, 2018). Rapid reversion to pre-industrial CO2 concentrations has been found to be ineffective at fostering regrowth of the AIS (DeConto et al., 2021) but may reduce the multimillennial sea level commitment (DeConto and Pollard, 2016). Altering sub-ice-shelf bathymetry (Wolovick and Moore, 2018) or triggering ice shelf advance through massive snow deposition (Feldmann et al., 2019) might interrupt marine ice sheet instability (Section 9.4.2.4) and thus reduce sea level commitment. A reversion to pre-industrial Greenland Ice Sheet temperatures with solar radiation modification is projected to stop mass loss in Greenland but leads to minimal regrowth (Applegate and Keller, 2015). Based on limited evidence, carbon dioxide removal, solar radiation modification, and local ice-shelf engineering may be effective at reducing the yet-to-be-realized sea level commitment, but ineffective at reversing GMSL rise (low confidence).Table 9.11  | Global mean sea level (GMSL) projections between 1995–2014 and 2300 for total change and individual contributions.
