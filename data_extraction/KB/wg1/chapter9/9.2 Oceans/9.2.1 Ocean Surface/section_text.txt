The density difference from surface to deep ocean is the upper-ocean stratification. The AR5 (Rhein et al., 2013) assessed that it is very likely  that the thermal contribution to stratification over the fixed 0–200 m layer increased by about 1% per decade between 1971 and 2010 (based on linear trend consistently across reports). The SROCC (Bindoff et al., 2019) found it very likely  that density stratification increased by 0.46–0.51% per decade between 60°S and 60°N from 1970 to 2017). New published estimates based on a variety of different interpolated observations show that SROCC assessed rate is too low, even using the same data and methods (Li et al., 2020). The 1960–2018 stratification increase is estimated at 1.2 ± 0.1% per decade from the IAP dataset, 1.2 ± 0.4% per decade from the Ishii product, 0.7 ± 0.5% per decade from the EN4 dataset, 0.9 ± 0.5% per decade from ORAS4, and 1.2 ±0.3% per decade from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) dataset (G. Li et al., 2020). The improved methodology for computing stratification change on individual profiles before gridding yields a global annual mean increase of 0–200 m stratification change of 0.8 ± 0.2% per decade between 1960 and 2018 (Yamaguchi and Suga, 2019) and a global summer mean increase of 0–200 m stratification change of 1.3 ± 0.3% per decade between 1970 and 2018 (Sallée et al., 2021) is of a similar magnitude to the long-term trend (Yamaguchi and Suga, 2019; G. Li et al., 2020). In summary, there is limited evidence that focusing on changes over a fixed depth range might hide larger increases occurring at the seasonally and regionally variable pycnocline depth. There is also limited evidence that summer stratification change within the pycnocline has occurred at a rate of 8.9 ± 2.7% per decade from 1970 to 2018, and limited evidence of a winter pycnocline stratification increase (Cummins and Ross, 2020; Sallée et al., 2021).While AR5 and SROCC did not assess change in mixed-layer depth, the reported changes in stratification can modulate the surface mixed-layer depth, which is set by a balance between fluxes and dynamical mixing (winds, tides, waves, convection) acting against the background stratification and restratification processes (solar and dynamical). Despite the large stratification increase observed at a global scale, new evidence shows that summer mixed-layer depth deepened consistently over the globe at a rate of 2.9 ± 0.5% per decade from 1970 to 2018, with the largest deepening observed in the Southern Ocean, corresponding to overall deepening from 3–15 m per decade depending on region (Somavilla et al., 2017; Sallée et al., 2021). While the shorter observational record in winter (compared to summer) does not allow global winter mixed-layer trends to be reliably assessed (Sallée et al., 2021), winter mixed-layer depths deepening at rates of 10 m per decade have been reported at individual long-term mid-latitude monitoring sites (Somavilla et al., 2017). Projections agree that shoaling of mixed-layer depth is expected in the 21st century, but only for strong emissions scenarios, and only in some regions (Figure 9.5). In summary, there is limited observational evidence that the mixed layer is globally deepening, while models show no emergence of a trend until later in the 21st century under strong emissions.Figure 9.5 | Mixed-layer depth in (a–d) winter and (e–h) summer.

The mixed-layer depth is the depth where the potential density is 0.03 kg m–3denser than at 10 m. No overlay indicates regions with high model agreement, where ≥80% of models agree on the sign of change. Diagonal lines indicate regions with low model agreement, where <80% of models agree on the sign of change (see Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1 for more information). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 9.SM.9). Open figureThe SROCC assessed that upper-ocean stratification will continue to increase in the 21st century under increased radiative forcing (high confidence), due to increased surface temperature and high-latitude surface freshening (Bindoff et al., 2019). New climate model simulations concur with SROCC assessment of a future increase of the 0–200 m stratification under increased radiative forcing in all regions of the world ocean (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). In addition, CMIP6 climate models project a shallowing of the mixed-layer in summer and winter by the end of the century under increased radiative forcing (Figure 9.5; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020), with the exception of the Arctic showing deepening of the mixed layer as a result of sea ice retreat (Figure 9.5; Lique et al., 2018). The regions of largest shallowing are associated with the deepest climatological mixed layer, in both winter and summer, particularly affecting the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean basins (Figure 9.5). While CMIP6 models tend to project shallowing mixed layers under a warming climate, except at high latitudes (Figure 9.5; Lique et al., 2018; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020), a deepening in the summer mixed-layer depth by intensification of the surface winds and storms may explain inconsistency among models in many regions (Figure 9.5; Young and Ribal, 2019), although model mixed-layer biases are large in the summer in the Southern Ocean (Belcher et al., 2012; Sallée et al., 2013a; Q. Li et al., 2016; Tsujino et al., 2020). Lack of observed ocean turbulence and climate model limitations do not allow for direct assessment of ocean surface turbulence change and limit confidence in past and future mixed-layer change. Understanding of turbulent processes, their representation in ocean and climate models, and their effect on mixed-layer biases have been an active and rapidly evolving topic of research since AR5 (Buckingham et al., 2019; Q. Li et al., 2019). Small-scale mixed-layer processes are not resolved in climate models (D’Asaro, 2014; Buckingham et al., 2019; McWilliams, 2019) and despite significant improvements in their parametrization over the last decade (Fox-Kemper et al., 2011; Jochum et al., 2013; Q. Li et al., 2016, 2019; Qiao et al., 2016) and significant improvement in some models (Li and Fox-Kemper, 2017; Dunne et al., 2020), biases in mixed-layer representation generally persist (Heuzé, 2017; Williams et al., 2018; Cherchi et al., 2019; Golaz et al., 2019; Voldoire et al., 2019; Yukimoto et al., 2019; Boucher et al., 2020; Danabasoglu et al., 2020; Dunne et al., 2020; Kelley et al., 2020). In summary, the representation of upper-ocean stratification and mixed layers has improved in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5. While it is virtually certain that the global mean upper ocean will continue to stratify in the 21st century, there is only low confidence in the future evolution of mixed-layer depth, which is projected to mostly shoal under high emissions, except in high-latitude regions where sea ice retreats.
