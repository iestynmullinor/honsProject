Human activities influence the regional water cycle directly through modifying and exploiting stores and flows from rivers, lakes and groundwater and by altering land cover characteristics. These actions alter surface energy and water balances through changes in permeability, surface albedo, evapotranspiration, surface roughness and leaf area. Direct redistribution of water by human activities for domestic, agricultural and industrial use of about 24,000 km3yr–1 (Figure 8.1) is equivalent to half the global river discharge or double the global groundwater recharge each year (Abbott et al., 2019). Since AR5, both modelling studies and observations have demonstrated that land use change can drive local and remote responses in precipitation and river flow by altering the surface energy balance, moisture advection and recycling, land –sea thermal contrast and associated wind patterns (Alter et al. , 2015; Wey et al. , 2015; De Vrese et al. , 2016; Pei et al. , 2016; Wang-Erlandsson et al. , 2018; Vicente-Serrano et al. , 2019). There is robust evidence that a warming climate combined with direct human demand for groundwater will deplete groundwater resources in already dry regions (Wada and Bierkens, 2014; D’Odorico et al., 2018; Jia et al., 2019).The SRCCL presented evidence that extraction of water from the ground or river systems and intensive irrigation increases evaporation and atmospheric water vapour locally (Jia et al., 2019; Mishra et al., 2020). Irrigation can explain declining groundwater storage in some regions, including north-western India and North America (Asoka et al., 2017; G. Ferguson et al., 2018). Simulations spanning 1960–2010 indicate that approximately 30% of the present human water consumption is supplied from non-sustainable water resources (Wada and Bierkens, 2014). However, there is onlylimited evidence that groundwater extraction is lowering streamflow (Mukherjee et al., 2018; de Graaf et al., 2019). Model experiments show that irrigation can either aggravate or alleviate climate‐induced changes of surface or subsurface water (Lenget al., 2015). Widespread extraction of water from rivers can reduce flows and decrease the level and area of inland seas and lakes (Wurtsbaugh et al. , 2017; Torres-Batlló et al. , 2020; X. Wang et al. , 2020). Between 1985 and 2015, about 139,000 km2 of inland water areas have become land, while creation of dams has converted about 95,000 km2 of land to water, particularly in the Amazon and Tibetan Plateau (Donchyts et al., 2016). Direct management of river flow is comparable in magnitude to climate change effects for snow-fed rivers at a continental scale based on a global analysis and a study of 96 Canadian catchments (Tan and Gan, 2015; Arheimer et al., 2017).The SRCCL assessed with medium confidence that mean and extreme precipitation is increased over and downwind of urban areas (Jia et al., 2019). There is medium confidence that altered thermodynamic and aerodynamic properties of the land surface from urbanization affects evaporation and increases precipitation over or downwind of cities (Box 10.3) due to altered stability and turbulence (Han et al. , 2014; Pathirana et al. , 2014; Jiang et al. , 2016; D’Odorico et al. , 2018; Sarangi et al. , 2018; Boyaj et al. , 2020). However, reduced biogenic aerosol, but increased anthropogenic aerosol emissions modify cloud microphysics and precipitation processes (Box 8.1; Schmidand Niyogi, 2017; D’Odorico et al. , 2018; Fan et al. , 2020; Zheng et al. , 2020). Urbanization also decreases permeability of the surface, leading to increased surface runoff (Chen et al., 2017; Jia et al., 2019). Large-scale infrastructure, such as the construction and operation of dikes, weirs, and hydropower plants, also alters surface energy and moisture fluxes, potentially influencing the regional water cycle. Limited modellingevidence suggests that large-scale solar and wind farms can increase precipitation locally (over the Sahel and North America) when dynamic vegetation responses are represented (Y. Li et al., 2018; Pryor et al., 2020), with remote effects also possible (Lu et al., 2021).Changes in land use from forest to agriculture can exert profound regional effects on the water cycle (FAQ 8.1) by modifying the surface energy balance and moisture recycling (Krishnan et al. , 2016; Paul et al. , 2016; Llopart  et al. , 2018; Singh et al. , 2019). There is medium evidence from modelling and observations over the Amazon and East Africa that deforestation drives increased streamflow (Dos Santos et al., 2018; Guzha et al., 2018; Levy et al., 2018) butlimited evidence that increases in global runoff due to deforestation are counterbalanced by decreases resulting from irrigation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Total Amazon deforestation drives reductions in precipitation but with a large 90% confidence range (–38 to +5 %) based on 44 primarily pre-AR5 climate model simulations (Spracklen and Garcia-Carreras, 2015) with smaller reductions (–2.3 to–1.3 %) attributed to observed Amazon deforestation up to 2010. Climate model development has reduced this uncertainty range but has not altered the median change (Lejeune et al., 2015). Large-scale global deforestation (20 million km2) simulated by 9 CMIP6 models confirms a large range in precipitation amount reduction of–37 ± 54 mm yr–1 over the deforested regions (Boysen et al., 2020). However, small-scale deforestation can increase precipitation locally (Lawrence and Vandecar, 2015). A 50–60% deforestation rate corresponded to a wet season delay of about one week and greater chance of dry spells of eight days or longer based on correlation analysis of rain gauge and land-use data for South America (Leite-Filhoet al., 2019). Forest and grassland fires can also modify hydrological response at the watershed scale (Havel et al., 2018). Afforestation or reforestation aimed at removing CO2 from the atmosphere can also alter the water cycle at the regional scale (Section 8.4.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.1).In summary, there is  high confidence that land-use change and water extraction for irrigation drive local, regional and remote responses in the water cycle. Large-scale deforestation is likely  to decrease precipitation over the deforested regions but there is low confidence in the effects of limited deforestation. There is medium confidence that deforestation drives increased streamflow relative to the responses caused by climate change. Urbanization can increase local precipitation (medium confidence) and resulting runoff intensity (high confidence). A warming climate combined with direct human demand for water is expected to deplete groundwater resources in dry regions (high confidence).
