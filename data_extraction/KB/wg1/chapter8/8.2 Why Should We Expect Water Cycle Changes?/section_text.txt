Aerosols affect precipitation in two major pathways, by altering the shortwave and longwave radiation and influencing cloud microphysical properties.Aerosol radiative effects on precipitationAerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation which reduces the energy available for surface evaporation and subsequent precipitation. In addition, cooling is incurred by the radiation that is reflected back to space directly by the aerosols and indirectly by the aerosol effect on cloud brightening. Northern Hemisphere (NH) station data indicate decreasing precipitation trends during the 1950s to the 1980s, which have since partially recovered (Wild, 2012; Bonfils et al., 2020). These changes are attributable with  high confidence to anthropogenic aerosol emissions from North America and Europe causing dimming through reduced surface solar radiation. This peaked during the late-1970s and partially recovered thereafter following improved air quality regulations (Section 6.2.1; Box 8.1, Figure 1).Box 8.1, Figure 1 | Northern Hemisphere surface downward radiation anomalies (W m–2; a) and precipitation anomalies (mm day–1; b) for1951–2014for summer season (May–September) monsoon region (Polson et al. , 2014) from CMIP6 DAMIP experiments. Observed solar radiation anomalies are from GEBA global data from 1961–2014 (Wild et al., 2017) and observed precipitation anomalies are from GPCC and CRU. CMIP6 multi-model mean anomalies are from all-forcings (ALL), greenhouse gas forcing (GHG) and anthropogenic aerosol forcing (AER) experiments. Anomalies are with respect to 1961–1990 and smoothed with a 11-year running mean. Red shading shows the ensemble spread of ALL forcing experiment (5–95% range). Models are masked to the GPCC data set. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 8.SM.1).Open figureDimming over the NH causes a relative cooling, compared to the Southern Hemisphere (SH), which induces a southward shift of the northern edge of the tropical rain belt (Section 3.3.2.3; Allen et al., 2014; Brönnimann et al., 2015). CMIP5 simulations show that most of the cooling is caused by the aerosol cloud-mediated effect (Chung and Soden, 2017). Dimming also weakens monsoon flow and precipitation, offsetting or even overcoming the expected precipitation increase due to increased GHGs (Ayantika et al., 2021). The oceanic response to a weakened monsoon cross-equatorial flow can further weaken the South Asian monsoon through an amplifying feedback loop (Swapna et al., 2012; Krishnan et al., 2016; Patil et al., 2019). These processes partially explain (medium confidence) the southward shift of the NH tropical edge of the tropical rain belt from the 1950s to the 1980s (Allen et al., 2014; Brönnimann et al., 2015) and the severe drought in the Sahel that peaked in the mid-1980s (Rotstayn et al., 2002; Undorf et al., 2018b). These processes also explain (high confidence) the observed decrease of South East Asian monsoon precipitation during the second half of the 20th century (Figure 8.7; Bollasina et al., 2011; Sanap et al., 2015; Krishnan et al., 2016; Lau and Kim, 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Undorf et al., 2018b).Absorption of solar radiation by anthropogenic aerosols such as black carbon warms the lower troposphere and increases moist static energy, but also results in larger convection inhibition that suppresses light rainfall (Box 8.1, Figure 2; Y. Wang et al., 2013). Release of aerosol-induced instability, often triggered by topographical barriers, produces intense rainfall, flooding (Fan et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016) and severe convective storms (medium confidence) (Saide et al., 2015). In particular, aerosols induce intense convection at the Himalaya foothills during the pre-monsoon season, which generates a regional convergence there (medium confidence). This mechanism is termed the ‘elevated heat pump hypothesis’ (Lau and Kim, 2006; D’Errico et al., 2015).Box 8.1, Figure 2 | Schematic depiction of the atmospheric effects of light-absorbing aerosols on convection and cloud formation: (a) without and (b) with the presence of absorbing aerosols in the planetary boundary layer.  The dashed and solid blue lines correspond to the vertical temperature profiles in the absence and presence of the absorbing aerosol layer, respectively, and the solid and dashed red lines denote the dry and moist adiabats, respectively. Absorbing aerosols result in an increasing temperature in the atmosphere but a reduced temperature at the surface. The reduced surface temperature and the increased temperature aloft led to a larger negative energy associated with convective inhibition (–) and a higher convection condensation level (CCL) under the polluted conditions. On the other hand, the absorbing aerosol layer induces a larger convective available potential energy (+) above CCL, facilitating more intensive vertical development of clouds, if lifting is sufficient to overcome the larger convective inhibition. Figure from Y. Wang et al. (2013).Open figureAerosol cloud microphysical effectsCloud droplets nucleate on pre-existing aerosol particles which act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Anthropogenic aerosols add CCN, compared to a pristine background, and produce clouds with more numerous and smaller droplets, slower to coalesce into raindrops and to freeze into ice hydrometeors at temperatures below 0°C. Adding CCN suppresses light rainfall from shallow and short-lived clouds, but it is compensated by heavier rainfall from deep clouds. Adding aerosols to clouds in extremely clean air invigorates them by more efficient vapour condensation on the added drop surfaces (Koren et al., 2014; Fan et al., 2018). Clouds forming in more polluted air masses (hence with more numerous and smaller drops) need to grow deeper to initiate rain (Freud and Rosenfeld, 2012; Konwar et al., 2012; Campos Braga et al., 2017). This leads to larger amount of cloud water evaporating aloft while cooling and moistening the air there at the expense of the lower levels, which leads to convective invigoration (Dagan et al., 2017; Chua and Ming, 2020), followed by convergence, air mass destabilization and added rainfall in an amplifying feedback loopBox 8.1(Abbott and Cronin, 2021). In addition, delaying rain initiation until greater altitudes are reached transports more cloud water above the 0°C altitude and leads to additional release of latent heat of freezing and/or vapour deposition, which in combination with the added latent heat of condensation enhances the cloud updrafts (Fan et al., 2018). The stronger updrafts invigorate mixed-phase precipitation and the resultant hail and cloud electrification (Rosenfeldet al., 2008; Thornton et al., 2017). This includes the outer convective rainbands of tropical cyclones. There is medium confidence that air pollution enhances flood hazard associated with the outer rain bands at the expense of the inner rain bands (Wang et al., 2014; C. Zhao et al., 2018; Souri et al., 2020).The aerosol effect on invigoration and rainfall from deep convective clouds peaks at moderate levels (aerosol optical depth of 0.2 to 0.3), but reverses into suppression with more aerosols (H. Liu et al., 2019). More generally, the microphysical aerosol-related processes often compensate or buffer each other (Stevens and Feingold, 2009). For example, suppressed rain by slowing drop coalescence enhances mixed-phase precipitation. Therefore, despite the potentially large aerosol influence on the precipitation forming processes, the net outcome of aerosol microphysical effects on precipitation amount has generallylow confidence, especially when evaluated with respect to the background of high natural variability in precipitation (Tao et al., 2012).Ice nucleating particle (INP) initiate ice precipitation from persistent supercooled water clouds that have cloud droplets too small for efficient warm rain, or expedite mixed-phase precipitation in short-lived supercooled rain clouds (Creamean et al., 2013). Most INPs are desert and soil dust particles, rather than air pollution aerosols (DeMott et al., 2010). Biogenic particles from terrestrial and marine origin are more rare, but important at temperatures above about–15°C (Murray et al., 2012; DeMott et al., 2016). Dust particles from long-range transport across the Pacific were found to enhance snow-forming processes over the Sierra Nevada in California (Creamean et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2014). The impact of INPs was demonstrated by glaciogenic cloud seeding experiments, which enhanced orographic supercooled clouds with medium confidence of success (French et al., 2018; Rauber et al., 2019; Friedrich et al., 2020). There are still major gaps in understanding the effects of INPs mainly on deep convective clouds (Kanji et al., 2017; Stanford et al., 2017; Korolev et al., 2020).
