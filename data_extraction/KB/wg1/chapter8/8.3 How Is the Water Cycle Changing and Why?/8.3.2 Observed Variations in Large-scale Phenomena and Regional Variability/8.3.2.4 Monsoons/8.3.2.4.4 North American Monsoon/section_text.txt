Since AR5, there have been updates on the observed long-term variations and changes in the North American monsoon (NAmerM). During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 21,000–19,000 years ago), the NAmerM was substantially weaker due to cold, dry mid-latitude air associated with the Laurentide Ice Sheet (T. Bhattacharya et al. , 2017, 2018). The NAmerM strengthened until the mid-Holocene period, in response to ice-emsheet retreat and rising summer insolation, but probably did not exceed the strength of the modern system (low confidence), as indicated by model simulations (Metcalfe et al., 2015) and paleoclimatic reconstructions (Bhattacharya et al., 2018). Paleoclimatic evidence from proxy datasets and mid-Pliocene (PlioMIP1) simulations suggest a wetter south-western USA during that warmer period (A.M. Haywood et al., 2013; Pound et al., 2014; Ibarra et al., 2018) but it is not clear whether this is due to increases of precipitation associated with the monsoon or occurring during the winter season.During 1948–2010, trends of boreal summer precipitation amount were significantly positive over New Mexico and the core NAmerM region, but significantly negative over south-western Mexico (Hoell et al., 2016). In addition, diverse datasets like CRU, CHIRPS and GPCP show significant decreases of precipitation in parts of the south-western USA and north-western Mexico, including the NAmerM region (Cavazos et al., 2020; Ashfaq et al., 2021). Other studies suggest a strengthening of the NAmerM upper level anticyclone since the mid-1970s, with a more frequent northward location (Diem et al., 2013). Between 1910–2010, the number of precipitation events increased across the northern Chihuahuan desert, within the NAmerM domain, despite a decrease in their magnitude, and the length of extreme dry and wet periods also increased (Petrie et al., 2014).An increase in intense rainfall and severe weather events has been observed in several locations, especially in south-western Arizona since 1991, resulting from increases in atmospheric moisture content and instability; a change that has been confirmed by convective-permitting model simulations (Luong et al., 2017; Pascale et al., 2019). A dense network of 59 rain gauges located in south-eastern Arizona suggests an intensification of monsoon sub-daily rainfall since the mid-1970s (Demaria et al., 2019), as expected by a stronger global warming signature for sub-daily rather than daily or monthly precipitation accumulation (Section 11.4). Section 10.4.2.3 provides further details on changes in precipitation in south-western North America. Evidence from multiple reanalyses suggests that increases in NAmerM rainfall have contributed to the increasing trend of global monsoon precipitation (Section 2.3.1.4.2; Lin et al., 2014). In addition, more frequent occurrence of earlier retreats of the NAmerM since 1979 is documented (Arias et al., 2012, 2015), in association with the positive phase of the Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV) and a westward expansion of the North Atlantic Subtropical High (W. Li et al., 2011, 2012).Analyses from a 50-km resolution GCM indicate that the NAmerM response to CO2 is very sensitive to SST biases, showing reductions in summer NAmerM precipitation with increased CO2 when the SST biases are small (Pascale et al., 2017) in contrast to CMIP5 models (Cook and Seager, 2013; Maloney et al., 2014; Torres-Alavez et al., 2014; Hoell et al., 2016). The NAmerM has been shown to be also sensitive to sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions (García-Martínez et al., 2020).In summary, both paleoclimate evidence and observations indicate an intensification of the NAmerM in a warmer climate (medium confidence). The intensification recorded since about the 1970s has been partly driven by GHG emissions (medium confidence).
