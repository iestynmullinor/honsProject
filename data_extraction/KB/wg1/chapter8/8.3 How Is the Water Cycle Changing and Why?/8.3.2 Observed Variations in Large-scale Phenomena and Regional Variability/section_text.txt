A positive trend has been observed in the Northern Annular Mode (NAM; Section AIV.2.1) in the second half of the 20th century, which partially reversed since the 1990s (Section 2.4.5.1), but the detection and attribution of these changes remain difficult (Section 3.7.1). The linkages of the NAM with weather and climate extremes in the northern extratropics are still unclear in models and observations (Vihma, 2014; Overland et al., 2016; Screen et al., 2018). However, robust links are identified between precipitation trends and variability in Europe and the phases of the Atlantic component of the NAM, that is, the NAO (Moore et al., 2013; Comas-Bru and McDermott, 2014). Reduced winter precipitation is well correlated with the NAO over Southern Europe and Mediterranean countries (Kalimeris et al. , 2017; Corona et al. , 2018; Vazifehkhah and Kahya, 2018; Neves et al. , 2019).  NAO teleconnections in those regions include influences on groundwater and streamflow (Zamrane et al., 2016; Massei et al., 2017; Jemai et al., 2018). Remote teleconnections of the NAO have been identified over Northern China, the Yangtze River valley and India (Jin and Guan, 2017; Di Capua et al., 2020). The summer phase of the NAO is significantly correlated with variations in summer rainfall in East China, with the thermal forcing of the Tibetan Plateau providing a link to this Eurasian teleconnection (Z. Wang et al., 2018).In the Southern Hemisphere (SH), an observed positive trend is identified in the strength of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM, Section AIV.2.2) since 1950, especially in austral summer (high confidence, Section 2.4.1.2). While stratospheric ozone depletion and GHG increases largely contributed to this change, climate models still have trouble simulating the SAM and its response to ozone and GHGs (Section 3.7.2). Shifts in the south-westerly winds (Fletcher et al., 2018) and the expansion of the SH Hadley cell (Kang and Polvani, 2011; H. Nguyen et al., 2018) influence SAM-related rainfall anomalies in in southern South America and southern Australia during the austral springâ€“summer. Over New Zealand, large-scale SLP and zonal wind patterns associated with SAM phases modulate regional river flow (Li and McGregor, 2017). The SAM also influences precipitation and water vapour changes over Antarctica via moisture fluxes (Marshall et al., 2017; Oshima and Yamazaki, 2017; Grieger et al., 2018) but CMIP5 models are limited in their ability to simulate these regional teleconnections (Marshall and Bracegirdle, 2015; Palerme et al., 2017). SAM and its interaction with other large-scale modes of climate variability, like ENSO (Fogt et al., 2011) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (Hoell et al., 2017a), are responsible for fluctuations in southern African rainfall (Nash, 2017) and southern South America (Gergis and Henley, 2017). In May, the SAM can trigger a southern Indian Ocean Dipole SSTA favoring more or less precipitation over the Indian sub-continent and adjacent areas (Dou et al., 2017), also affecting subsequent summer monsoon in the South China Sea (T. Liu et al., 2018). Over South America, a positive SAM is associated with dry conditions (Holz et al., 2017) due to reduced frontal and orographic precipitation and weakening of moisture convergence. Regions particularly affected include Chile (Boisier et al., 2018) and the rivers of central Patagonia (Rivera et al., 2018).In summary, while the attribution of 20th century variations of the NAM/NAO is still unclear, there is a strong relationship with precipitation changes over Europe and in the Mediterranean region (high confidence). SAM teleconnections are associated with changes in moisture transport and extend to South America, Australia and Antarctica (high confidence) with documented drying occurring as a result of the very likely human-induced SAM trend toward its positive phase observed from the 1970s until the 1990s (Section 3.7.2).
