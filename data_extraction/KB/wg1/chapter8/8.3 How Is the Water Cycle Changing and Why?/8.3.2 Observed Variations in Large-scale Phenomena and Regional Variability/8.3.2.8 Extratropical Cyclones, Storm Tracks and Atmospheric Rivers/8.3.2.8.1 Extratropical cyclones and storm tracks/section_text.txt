The AR5 indicated low confidence in long-term changes in the intensity of extratropical cyclones (ETC) over the 20th century derived from centennial reanalyses and storminess proxies based upon sea level pressure. This was confirmed by the SREX assessment that the main Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) extratropical storm tracks likely experienced a poleward shift during the last 50 years (Seneviratne et al., 2012) with low confidence, and inconsistencies within reanalysis datasets remain.Since AR5 there has been considerable progress in quantifying storm track activity using multiple reanalysis products and different methodologies (Hodges et al. , 2011; Neu et al. , 2013; Tilinina et al. , 2013; X.L. Wang et al. , 2016). Over the NH increases in the total number of cyclones from 1979 show a large spread of trends across different estimates (Section 2.3.1.4.3; Neu et al., 2013; Z. Li et al., 2016a; Grieger et al., 2018) resulting in low confidence in any clear increase of in the total number of cyclones. However, starting from the early 1990s, most reanalyses show increases in the total cyclone number by about 2–5% per decade (Figure 8.12). Increasing trends in the total number of cyclones are dominated by the increase in the number of shallow and moderate cyclones (which are more dependent on the datasets and identification methods used) than with decreasing number of deep cyclones since the early 1990s (Tilinina et al., 2013; Chang, 2018). In the SH the variability of the total number of cyclones is characterized by strong inter-decadal variability preventing a clear assessment of trends. However, in contrast to the NH,there is a significant increasing trend in the number of deep cyclones (about 10% over 1979–2018) in ERA5, ERA-Interim, JRA55 and MERRA, and in the CFSR dataset after 2000 (Figure 8.12; Reboita et al., 2015; X.L. Wang et al., 2016).Figure 8.12 | Annual anomalies (with respect to the reference period1979–2018) of the total number of extratropical cyclones (a, b) and of the number of deep cyclones (<980 hPa) (c, d) over the Northern (a, c) and the Southern (b, d) Hemispheres in different reanalyses (shown in colours in the legend).

(e, f) The number of reanalyses (out of five) simultaneously indicating statistically significant (90% level) linear trends of the same sign during 1979–2018 for JFM (January–February–March) over the Northern Hemisphere (e) and over the Southern Hemisphere (f). Updated from Tilinina et al. (2013). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 8.SM.1).Open figureChanges in the number of deep storms, which are often associated with heavier precipitiation over the North Atlantic and North Pacific, exhibit strong seasonal differences and decadal variability (Colle et al. , 2015; Chang et al. , 2016; Matthews et al. , 2016; Priestley et al. , 2020a). An increase in the number of summer cyclones over the Atlantic-European sector (Tilinina et al. , 2013)  is consistent with the increase in the strength of the strongest fronts over Europe (Schemm et al. , 2018). Chang et al.  (2016) reported a decrease in the number of strong summer storms in the latitudinal band 40°N–75°N over the last decades, however, the assessment of seasonal trends in the Atlantic-European sector is complicated by the choice of region, attribution of tracks to the region selected, and thresholds used to identify trajectories, leading to low confidence on regional seasonal trends. For the SH, Grieger et al. (2018) reported a growing number of cyclones over sub-Antarctic region in the austral-summer during 1979–2010, while statistically significant trends were absent during the austral winter.Analysis of storm track activity over longer periods suffers from uncertainties associated with changing data assimilation and observations before and during the satellite era, resulting in in homogeneities and discontinuities in centennial reanalyses (Krueger et al. , 2013; X.L. Wang et al. , 2013, 2016; Chang and Yau, 2016; Varino et al. , 2019). Feser et al.  (2015) reviewed multiple storm track records for the Atlantic-European sector and demonstrated growing storm activity north of 55°N from the 1970s to the mid-1990s with declining trend thereafter, sugesting strong inter-decadal variability in storm track activity. This was also confirmed by Krueger et al. (2019) from the analysis of geostrophic winds derived from sea level pressure gradients.Poleward deflection of mostly oceanic winter storm tracks since 1979 was reported in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific (Tilinina et al., 2013; J. Wang et al., 2017). This large-scale tendency has regional variations and may be seasonally dependent. Wise and Dannenberg (2017) reported a southward shift in the east Pacific storm track from the 1950s to mid-1980s followed by northward deflection in the later decades. (King et al., 2019) reported an association of Atlantic storm track migrations with SSW events with Central and South European precipitation anomalies. Over centennial time scales, Gan and Wu (2014) reported an intensification of storm tracks in the poleward and downstream regions of the North Pacific and North Atlantic upper troposphere using the NOAA–CIRES–DOE Twentieth Century Reanalysis. Poleward migration of the SH storm tracks (Grise et al., 2014; X.L. Wang et al., 2016; Dowdy et al., 2019) was identified during the austral summer and is closely associated with cyclone-associated frontal activity (Solman and Orlanski, 2014, 2016) and cloud cover (Bender et al., 2012; Norris et al., 2016).The representation of ETCs in both climate models and reanalyses is resolution-dependent, hence changes must be assessed with caution (Section 3.3.3.3). In particular, CMIP5 models show a systematic underestimation of the intensity of ETCs (Zappa et al., 2014), a feature that is partially related to their relatively coarse resolution or other possible deficiencies such as an excess of dissipation (Chang et al., 2013). The best representation of ETCs and their intensity in the North Atlantic are provided by relatively high horizontal resolution CMIP5 models (Zappa et al., 2014). Using a single high-resolution climate model, (Hawcroft et al., 2016) showed that precipitation amount associated with ETCs was generally well simulated, though with too much precipitation during the strongest ECTs compared with observed estimations.In summary, there is low confidence in recent changes in the total number of extratropical cyclones over both hemispheres. It is as likely as not  that the number of deep cyclones over the NH has decreased after 1979 and it is likely  that the number of deep extratropical cyclones increased over the same period in the SH. It is likely  that extratropical cyclone activity in the SH has intensified during austral summer with no significant changes in austral winter. There is medium confidence that boreal-winter storm tracks during the last decades experienced poleward shifts over the NH and SH oceans. There is low confidence of changes in extratropical cyclone activity prior 1979 due to inhomogeneities in the intrumental records and modern reanalyses.
