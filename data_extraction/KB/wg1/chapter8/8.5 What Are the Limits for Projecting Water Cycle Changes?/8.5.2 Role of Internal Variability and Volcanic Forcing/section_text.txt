Volcanic eruptions can affect climate projections in the near term (2021–2040; Section 4.4.4 and Cross-Chapter Box 4.1). In this chapter, they are of interest because they can trigger a transient departure from the water cycle response to anthropogenic radiative forcing. Major volcanic eruptions temporarily reduce total global and wet tropical region precipitation (high confidence) (Iles and Hegerl, 2014), can weaken or shift the ITCZ (Iles and Hegerl, 2014; Colose et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016), and reduce summer monsoon rainfall (medium confidence) (Pausata et al. , 2015b; Zambri and Robock, 2016; Zambri et al. , 2017; Zuo et al. , 2019; M. Singh et al. , 2020). Monsoon precipitation in one hemisphere can be enhanced by the remote volcanic forcing occurring in the other hemisphere (medium confidence) (Pausata et al. , 2015a; Liu et al. , 2016; Zuo et al. , 2019). Over the Sahel, the sign of hydrological changes depend on the hemisphere where the volcanic eruptions occur (J.M. Haywood et al., 2013). Out of phase changes in the Sahel and the Amazonian basin are expected from the effect of volcanic aerosols on tropical Atlantic SST and the ITCZ (Hua et al., 2019). Over the last millennium, uncertainties remain in the symmetry/asymmetry of the monsoon response because it is difficult to estimate the exact latitude and season of past volcanic eruptions further back in time (Colose et al., 2016; Fasullo et al., 2019).Data for six major eruptions over the last century along with CMIP5 historical experiments indicate that volcanic eruptions cause a detectable decrease in streamflow in northern South America, Central Africa, high-latitude Asia and in wet tropical–subtropical regions, and a detectable increase in south-western North America and southern South America (Iles and Hegerl, 2015). Attempts to include volcanic forcing in future projections show enhanced precipitation variability on annual to decadal time scales with small reductions in Asian monsoon rainfall (Bethke et al., 2017). The occurrence of volcanic eruptions in the coming century, either as single large events or clustered smaller ones, can alter the water cycle (see also Cross-Chapter Box 4.1), and regional drought events may be enhanced by co-occurring volcanic (Liu et al., 2016; Gao and Gao, 2017; Zambri et al., 2017) and GHG (e.g., Cook et al., 2018) forcing (low confidence). Volcanic eruptions may also lead to widespread precipitation anomalies up to several years following an eruption through their potential influence on the El Niño Southern Oscillation (low confidence) (Stevenson et al., 2016; Dee et al., 2020; McGregor et al., 2020).In summary, large volcanic eruptions reduce global mean precipitation, as well as precipitation in tropical wet regions (high confidence). There is low confidence in specific regional and seasonal responses, primarily due to the limitations of the observational record.
