Based on long-term observational evidence (Hartmann et al., 2013), AR5 concluded it was likely  that anthropogenic influence has affected the water cycle since the 1960s (IPCC, 2018). Detectable human influ­ence on changes to the water cycle were found in atmospheric moisture content (medium confidence), global-scale changes of precipitation over land (medium confidence), intensification of heavy precipitation events over land regions where sufficient data networks exist (medium confidence), and very likely changes to ocean salinity through its connection with evaporation minus precipitation change patterns (Sections 2.5, 2.6, 3.3, 7.6, 10.3 and 10.4; Stocker et al., 2013). The AR5 also reported that it is very likely  that global surface air specific humidity increased since the 1970s. There was low confidence in the observations of global-scale cloud variability and trends, medium confidence in reductions of pan-evaporation, and medium confidence in the non-monotonic changes of global evapotranspiration since the 1980s. In terms of streamflow and runoff, AR5 identified that there is low confidence in the observed increasing trends of global river discharge during the 20th century. Similarly, AR5 concluded that there is low confidence in any global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the mid-20th century. Yet, the frequency and intensity of drought likely  increased in the Mediterranean and West Africa, while theylikely decreased in central North America and north-western Australia since 1950.Water cycle projections in AR5 (Collins et al., 2013) were considered primarily in terms of water vapour, precipitation, surface evaporation, runoff, and snowpack. Globally-averaged precipitation was projected to increase with global warming with virtual certainty (Chapter 12 Executive Summary and Section 12.4.1.1). Regionally, precipitation in some areas of the tropics and polar regions could increase by more than 50% by the end of the 21st century under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario, while precipitation in large areas of the subtropics could decrease by 30% or more (AR5 FAQ 12.2, Figure 12.22). Overall, the contrast of annual mean precipitation between dry and wet regions and between dry and wet seasons (‘wet get wetter, dry get drier’) was projected to increase over most of the globe with  high confidence (Chapter 12 Executive Summary and Section 12.4.5.2). Globally, the frequency of intense precipitation events was projected to increase while the frequency of all precipitation events was projected to decrease, leading to the contradictory-seeming projection of a simultaneous increase in both droughts and floods (12.2 and Section 12.4.5.5 in AR5 WGI). Surface evaporation change was projected to be positive over most of the ocean and to generally follow the pattern of precipitation change over land Chapter 12 Executive Summary, and Section 12.4.5.4). Near-surface relative humidity reductions over many land areas were projected to be likely , with medium confidence (Section 12.4.5.1). General decreases in soil moisture in present-day dry regions were considered likely ,  and projected with medium confidence under the RCP8.5 scenario (Section 12.4.5.3). Soil moisture drying in the Mediterranean, south-west USA and southern African regions was considered likely , with  high confidence by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario (Section 12.4.5.3). Projections for annual runoff included both decreases and increases. Decreases in Northern Hemisphere snow cover were assessed as very likely  with continued global warming (Section 12.4.6.2). As temperatures increase, snow accumulation was projected to begin later in the year and melting to start earlier, with related changes in snowmelt-driven river flows (FAQ 12.2 and Section 12.4.6.2 in AR5 WGI). In terms of the potential for abrupt change in components of the water cycle, long-term droughts and monsoonal circulation were identified as potentially undergoing rapid changes, but the assessment was reported with low confidence (Sections 12.5.5.8.1 and 12.5.5.8.2, and Table 12.4).
