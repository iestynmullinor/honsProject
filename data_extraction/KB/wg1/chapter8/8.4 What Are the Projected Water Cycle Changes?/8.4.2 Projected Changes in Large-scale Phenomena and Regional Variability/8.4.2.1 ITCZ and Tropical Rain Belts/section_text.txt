CMIP5 projections show no consistent shift in the zonal mean position of the ITCZ (Donohoe et al. , 2013; Donohoe and Voigt, 2017; Byrne et al. , 2018). The ITCZ position is strongly connected to cross-equatorial energy transport (Kang et al. , 2008; Bischoff and Schneider, 2014), which also shows no consistent change in future projections (Donohoe et al., 2013). Since AR5 it has been reported that most CMIP5 models project a narrowing of the ITCZ in response to surface warming together with intensified ascent in the core region and weakened ascent on the ITCZ edges (Lau and Kim, 2015; Byrne et al., 2018), implying a narrowing of precipitation regions influenced by the ITCZ. Modelled changes in the width and intensity of the zonal mean ITCZ are strongly anti-correlated, for example, narrowing is associated with increased intensity while broadening with decreased intensity. Such changes are associated with changes in tropical high cloud fraction and outgoing longwave radiation (Su et al., 2017; Byrne et al., 2018).Regional shifts in tropical convergence zones are much larger than their zonal mean, and associated regional changes in precipitation (Chadwick et al., 2013; Mamalakis et al., 2021) are characterized by considerable uncertainties across models (Kent et al., 2015; Oueslati et al., 2016). Over the tropical oceans, shifts in rain bands are strongly coupled with changes in SSTs (Xie et al. , 2010; Huang et al. , 2013). Over tropical land, factors including remote SST increases (Giannini, 2010), the direct CO2 effect (Biasutti, 2013) and landâ€“atmosphere interactions (Chadwick et al., 2017; Kooperman et al., 2018) influence projections. CMIP6 models project a clear northward ITCZ shift over eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean as well as a southward shift over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as a result of regionally-contrasting inter-hemispheric energy flows (Mamalakis et al., 2021). The northward movement of the ITCZ over Africa has been linked to an intensification of the Saharan heat low associated with greenhouse gas (GHG) warming (Dong and Sutton, 2015), causing the tropical rain belt to seasonally migrate farther northward and reside there longer (Cook and Vizy, 2012; Dunning et al., 2018). In southern Africa, the projected delay in the wet season onset (Dunning et al. , 2018)  is also associated with a circulation-based northward shift in the tropical rain band  (Lazenby et al., 2018).In summary, consistent with the AR5, the overall weakening of the tropical circulation is projected in CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations with  high confidence. It is likely  that the zonal mean of the ITCZ will narrow and strengthen in the core region with projected surface warming (high confidence). Distinct regional shifts in the ITCZ will be associated with regional changes in precipitation amount and seasonality (medium confidence).
