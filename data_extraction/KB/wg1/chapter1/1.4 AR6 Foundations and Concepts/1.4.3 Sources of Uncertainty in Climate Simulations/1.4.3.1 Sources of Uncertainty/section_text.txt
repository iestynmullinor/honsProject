It is plausible that there are interactions between radiative forcings and climate variations, such as influences on the phasing or amplitude of internal or natural climate variability (Zanchettin, 2017). For example, the timing of volcanic eruptions may influence Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (e.g., Otter√• et al., 2010; Birkel et al., 2018) or ENSO (e.g., Maher et al., 2015; Khodri et al., 2017; Zuo et al., 2018), and anthropogenic aerosols may influence decadal modes of variability in the Pacific (e.g., Smith et al., 2016). In addition, melting of glaciers and ice caps due to anthropogenic influences has been speculated to increase volcanic activity (e.g., a specific example for Iceland is discussed in Swindles et al., 2018).
