The IPCC First Assessment Report (FAR, IPCC, 1990a) provided the scientific background for the establishment of the UNFCCC (UNFCCC, 1992), which committed parties to negotiate ways to ‘prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system’ (the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC). The Second Assessment Report (SAR, IPCC, 1996) informed governments in negotiating the Kyoto Protocol (1997), the first major agreement focusing on mitigation under the UNFCCC. The Third Assessment report (TAR, IPCC, 2001a) highlighted the impacts of climate change and the need for adaptation, and introduced the treatment of new topics such as policy and governance in IPCC reports. The Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports (AR4, IPCC, 2007a; AR5, IPCC, 2013a) provided the scientific background for the second major agreement under the UNFCCC: the Paris Agreement (2015), which entered into force in 2016.
