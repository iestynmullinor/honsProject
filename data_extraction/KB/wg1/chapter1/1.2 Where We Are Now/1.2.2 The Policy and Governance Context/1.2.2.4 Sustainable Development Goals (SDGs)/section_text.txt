Many interactions among environmental problems and development are addressed in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals. The 2030 Agenda, supported by the finance-oriented Addis Ababa Action Agenda (UN DESA, 2015), calls on nations to ‘take the bold and transformative steps which are urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path.’ The 2030 Agenda recognizes that ‘climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and its adverse impacts undermine the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable development.’ SDG 13 deals explicitly with climate change, establishing several targets for adaptation, awareness-raising and finance. Climate and climate change are also highly relevant to most other SDGs, and UNFCCC is acknowledged as the main forum to negotiate the global response to climate change. For example, both long-lived GHGs (through mitigation decisions), and SLCFs (through air quality), are relevant to SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities). Chapter 6 assesses the effects of SLCFs on climate and the implications of changing climate for air quality, including opportunities for mitigation relevant to the SDGs (Box 6.2). Also, the UN Conference on Housing and Sustainable Development established a New Urban Agenda (United Nations, 2017) envisaging cities as part of the solutions for sustainable development, climate change adaptation and mitigation.
