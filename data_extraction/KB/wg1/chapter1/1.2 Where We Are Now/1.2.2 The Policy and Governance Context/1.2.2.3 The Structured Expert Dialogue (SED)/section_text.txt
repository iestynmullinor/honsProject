Since AR5, the formal dialogue between the scientific and policy communities has been strengthened through a new science– policy interface, the Structured Expert Dialogue (SED). The SED was established by UNFCCC to support the work of its two subsidiary bodies, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). The first SED aimed to ‘ensure the scientific integrity of the first periodic review’ of the UNFCCC, the 2013–2015 review. The Mandate of the periodic review is to ‘assess the adequacy of the long-term (temperature) goal in light of the ultimate objective of the convention’ and the ‘overall progress made towards achieving the long-term global goal, including a consideration of the implementation of the commitments under the Convention.’The SED of the first periodic review (2013–2015) provided an important opportunity for face-to-face dialogue between decision makers and experts on review themes, based on ‘the best available scientific knowledge, including the assessment reports of the IPCC.’ That SED was instrumental in informing the long-term global goal of the PA and in providing the scientific argument for the consideration of limiting warming to 1.5°C warming (UNFCCC, 2015; Fischlin, 2017). The SED of the second periodic review, initiated in the second half of 2020, focuses on, among other things, ‘enhancing Parties’ understanding of the long-term globalgoal and the scenarios towards achieving it in the light of the ultimate objective of the Convention’. The second SED provides a formal venue for the scientific and the policy communities to discuss the requirements and benchmarks to achieve the ‘long-term temperature goal’ (LTTG) of 1.5°C and well below 2°C global warming. The discussions also concern the associated timing of net zero emissions targets and the different interpretations of the PA LTTG, including the possibility of overshooting the 1.5° C warming level before returning to it by means of negative emissions (e.g., Section 1.6; Schleussner and Fyson, 2020). The second periodic review is planned to continue until November 2022 and its focus includes the review of the progress made since the first review, while minimising ‘possible overlaps’ and profiting from ‘synergies with the global stocktake’.
