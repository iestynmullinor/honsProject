The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is a non-binding agreement to reduce risks associated with disasters of all scales, frequencies and onset rates caused by natural or human-made hazards, including climate change. The SFDRR outlines targets and priorities for action including ‘understanding disaster risk’, along the dimensions of vulnerability, exposure of persons and assets, and hazard characteristics. Chapter 12 assesses climate information relevant to regional impact and risk assessment, with a focus on climate hazards and other aspects of climate that influence society and ecosystems and makes the link with Working Group II. AR6 adopts a consistent risk- and solution-oriented framing (Cross-Chapter Box 1.3) that calls for a multidisciplinary approach and cross-Working Group coordination in order to ensure integrative discussions of major scientific issues associated with integrative risk management and sustainable solutions (IPCC, 2017).
