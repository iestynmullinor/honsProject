The main purposes of this chapter are: (i) to set the scene for the WGI Assessment and to place it in the context of ongoing global changes, international policy processes, the history of climate science and the evolution from previous IPCC assessments, including the Special Reports prepared as part of the Sixth Assessment Cycle; (ii) to describe key concepts and methods, relevant developments since AR5, and the modelling framework used in this Assessment; and (iii) together with the other chapters of this report, to provide context and support for the WGII and WGIII contributions to AR6, particularly on climate information to support mitigation, adaptation and risk management.The chapter comprises seven sections (Figure 1.3). Section 1.2 describes the present state of Earth’s climate, in the context of reconstructed and observed long-term changes and variations caused by natural and anthropogenic factors. It also provides context for the present Assessment by describing recent changes in international climate change governance and fundamental scientific values. The evolution of knowledge about climate change and the development of earlier IPCC assessments are presented in Section 1.3. Approaches, methods and key concepts of this Assessment are introduced in Section 1.4. New developments in observing networks, reanalyses, modelling capabilities and techniques since AR5 are discussed in Section 1.5. The three main ‘dimensions of integration’ across Working Groups in AR6, that is, emissions scenarios, global warming levels and cumulative carbon emissions, are described in Section 1.6. The Chapter closes with a discussion of opportunities and gaps in knowledge integration in Section 1.7.Figure 1.3 | Visual guide to Chapter 1. Open figure
