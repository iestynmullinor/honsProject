The AR6 WGI report, as a result of its scoping process, is structured around topics such as large-scale information, process understanding and regional information (Figure 1.1). This represents a rearrangement relative to the structure of the WGI contribution to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5; IPCC, 2013a), as summarized in Figure 1.2. The AR6 approach aims at a greater visibility of key knowledge developments that are potentially relevant for policymakers, including climate change mitigation, regional adaptation planning based on a risk management framework, and the global stocktake.Two key subjects presented separately in AR5, paleoclimate and model evaluation, are now distributed among multiple AR6 WGI chapters. Various other cross-cutting themes are also distributed throughout this Report. A summary of these themes and their integration across chapters is described in Table 1.1.Table 1.1 |  Cross-cutting themes in AR6 WGI, and the main chapters that deal with them. Bold numbers in the table indicate the chapters that have extensive coverage.

The left-hand column shows the AR5 WGI chapter categories. The central column lists the AR5 WGI chapters, with the colour code indicating their relation to the AR6 WGI structure shown in Figure 1.1: Large-Scale Information (purple), Process Understanding (gold), Regional Information (light blue) and Whole-Report Information (dark blue). AR5 WGI chapters depicted in white have their topics distributed over multiple AR6 WGI chapters and categories. The right-hand column explains where to find related information in the AR6 WGI report.
