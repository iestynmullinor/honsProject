Integration of assessments across the chapters of the WGI Report, and with WGII and WGIII, occurs in a number of ways, including work on a common Glossary, risk framework (Cross-Chapter Box 1.3), scenarios and projections of future large-scale changes, and the presentation of results at various global warming levels (Section 1.6).Chapters 8 to 12, and the Atlas, cover topics also assessed by WGII in several areas, including regional climate information and climate-related risks. This approach produces a more integrated assessment of impacts of climate change across Working Groups. In particular, Chapter 10 discusses the generation of regional climate information for users, the co-design of research with users, and the translation of information into the user context (in particular directed towards WGII). Chapter 12 provides a direct bridge between physical climate information (climatic impact-drivers) and sectoral impacts and risk, following the chapter organization of the WGII Assessment. Notably, Cross-Chapter Box 12.1 draws a connection to representative key risks and Reasons for Concern (RFC).The science assessed in Chapters 2 to 7, such as the carbon budget, short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) and emissions metrics, are topics in common with WGIII, and relevant for the mitigation of climate change. This includes a consistent presentation of the concepts of carbon budget and net zero emissions targets within chapters, in order to support integration in the Synthesis Report. Emissions-driven emulators (simple climate models), summarized in Cross-Chapter Box 7.1, are used to approximate large-scale climate responses of complex Earth System Models (ESMs) and have been used as tools to explore the expected global surface air temperature (GSAT) response to multiple scenarios consistent with those assessed in WGI for the classification of scenarios in WGIII. Chapter 6 provides information about the impact of climate change on global air pollution, relevant for WGII, including Cross-Chapter Box 6.1 on the implications of the recent coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) for climate and air quality. Cross-Chapter Box 2.3 in Chapter 2 presents an integrated cross-Working Group discussion of global temperature definitions, with implications for many aspects of climate change science.In addition, Chapter 1 sets out a shared terminology on cross-cutting topics, including climate risk, attribution and storylines, as well as an introduction to emissions scenarios, global warming levels and cumulative carbon emissions as an overarching topic for integration across all three Working Groups.All these integration efforts are aimed at enhancing the bridges and ‘handshakes’ among Working Groups, enabling the final cross-Working Group exercise of producing the integrated Synthesis Report.
