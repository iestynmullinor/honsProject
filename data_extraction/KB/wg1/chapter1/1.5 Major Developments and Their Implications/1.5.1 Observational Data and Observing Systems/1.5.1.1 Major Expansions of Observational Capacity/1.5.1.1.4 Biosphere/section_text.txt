Satellite observations have recently expanded to include data on the fluorescence of land plants as a measure of photosynthetic activity via the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME; Guanter et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015) and OCO-2 satellites (Sun et al., 2017). Climate data records of leaf area index (LAI), characterizing the area of green leaves per unit of ground area, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) – an important indicator of photosynthetic activity and plant health (Gobron et al., 2009) – are now available for over 30 years (Claverie et al., 2016). In addition, key indicators such as fire disturbances/burned areas are now retrieved via satellite (Chuvieco et al., 2019). In the US, the National Ecological Observational Network (NEON) provides continental-scale observations relevant to the assessment of changes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems via a wide variety of ground-based, airborne, and satellite platforms (Keller et al., 2008). All these long-term records reveal range shifts in ecosystems (Section 2.3.4).The ability to estimate changes in global land biomass has improved due to the use of different microwave satellite data (Liu et al., 2015) and in situ forest census data and co-located lidar, combined with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; Baccini et al., 2017). This has allowed for improved quantification of land temperature (Duan et al., 2019), carbon stocks and human-induced changes due to deforestation (Chapter 2, Section 2.2.7). Time series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from MODIS and other remote-sensing platforms is widely applied to assess the effects of climate change on vegetation in drought-sensitive regions (Atampugre et al., 2019). New satellite imaging capabilities for meteorological observations, such as the advanced multispectral imager aboard Himawari-8 (Bessho et al., 2016), also allow for improved monitoring of challenging quantities such as seasonal changes of vegetation in cloudy regions (Section 2.3.4.3; Miura et al., 2019).In the ocean, efforts are underway to coordinate observations of biologically relevant EOVs around the globe (Muller-Karger et al., 2018; Canonico et al., 2019) and to integrate observations across disciplines (e.g., the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network, GOA-ON; Tilbrook et al., 2019). A large number of coordinated field campaigns during the 2015/2016 El Niño event enabled the collection of short-lived biological phenomena such as coral bleaching and mortality caused by a months-long ocean heatwave (Hughes et al., 2018); beyond this event, coordinated observations of coral reef systems are increasing in number and quality (Obura et al., 2019). Overall, globally coordinated efforts focused on individual components of the biosphere (e.g., the Global Alliance of Continuous Plankton Recorder Surveys, GACS; Batten et al., 2019) contribute to improved knowledge of the ways in which marine ecosystems are changing (Section 2.3.4.2).Given widespread evidence for decreases in global biodiversity in recent decades – and that these decreases are related to climate change and other forms of human disturbance (IPBES, 2019) – a new international effort to identify a set of Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) is underway (Pereira et al., 2013; Navarro et al., 2017).In summary, the observational coverage of ongoing changes to the climate system is improved at the time of AR6, relative to what was available for AR5 (high confidence).
