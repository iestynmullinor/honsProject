Although reanalyses such as ERA5 take advantage of new observational datasets and present a great improvement in atmospheric reanalyses, the issues introduced by the evolving observational network remain. Sparse input reanalyses, where only a limited set of reliable and long-observed records are assimilated, address these issues, with the limitation of fewer observational constraints. These efforts are sometimes called centennial-scale reanalyses. One example is the atmospheric 20th century Reanalysis (Compo et al., 2011; Slivinski et al., 2021) which assimilates only surface and sea-level pressure observations, and is constrained by time-varying observed changes in atmospheric constituents, prescribed sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentration, creating a reconstruction of the weather over the whole globe every three hours for the period 1806–2015. The ERA-20C atmospheric reanalysis (covering 1900–2010; Poli et al., 2016) also assimilates marine wind observations, and CERA-20C is a centennial-scale reanalysis that assimilates both atmospheric and oceanic observations for the 1901–2010 period (Laloyaux et al., 2018). These centennial-scale reanalyses are often run as ensembles that provide an estimate of the uncertainty in the simulated variables over space and time. Slivinski et al. (2021) conclude that the uncertainties in surface circulation fields in version 3 of the 20th century Reanalysis are reliable and that there is also skill in its tropospheric reconstruction over the 20th century. Long-term changes in other variables, such as precipitation, also agree well with direct observation-based datasets (Sections 2.3.1.3 and 8.3.2.8).
