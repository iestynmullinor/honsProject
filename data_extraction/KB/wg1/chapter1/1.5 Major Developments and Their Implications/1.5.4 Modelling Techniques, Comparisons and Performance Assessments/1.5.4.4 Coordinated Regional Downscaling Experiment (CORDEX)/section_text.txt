The Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX; Gutowski Jr. et al., 2016) is an intercomparison project for regional models and statistical downscaling techniques, coordinating simulations on common domains and under common experimental conditions in a similar way to the CMIP effort. Dynamical and statistical downscaling techniques can provide higher-resolution climate information than is available directly from global climate models (Section 10.3). These techniques require evaluation and quantification of their performance before they can be considered appropriate as usable regional climate information or be used in support of climate services. CORDEX simulations have been provided by a range of regional downscaling models for 14 regions, together covering much of the globe (Figure Atlas.7), and they are used extensively in the AR6 WGI Atlas (Atlas.1.4 and Annex II).In support of AR6, CORDEX has undertaken a new experiment (CORDEX-CORE) in which regional climate models downscale a common set of global model simulations, performed at a coarser resolution, to a spatial resolution spanning from 12â€“25 km over most of the CORDEX domains (Box Atlas.1). CORDEX-CORE represents an improved level of coordinated intercomparison of downscaling models (Remedio et al., 2019).
