In recent years, the role of internal variability in the interpretation of climate projections has become clearer, particularly at the regional scale (Section 10.3.4.3). A considerable fraction of CMIP5 and CMIP6 resources has been invested in generating an ensemble of centennial or multi-centennial control simulations with constant external forcings (Pedro et al., 2016; Rackow et al., 2018). As part ofthe CMIP6 DECK (Eyring et al., 2016a) pre-industrial control (piControl) simulations have been conducted (Menary et al., 2018). Similarly, control simulations with present-day conditions (pdControl) have been performed to represent internal variability under more recent forcing conditions (Pedro et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2018). Control simulations have been used to study the role of internal variability, teleconnections and many other fundamental aspects of climate models (Z. Wang et al., 2015; Krishnamurthy and Krishnamurthy, 2016). Control simulations are also used along with large ensembles of historical or scenario simulations to assess the characteristics of the regional internal climate variability (Olonscheck and Notz, 2017).
