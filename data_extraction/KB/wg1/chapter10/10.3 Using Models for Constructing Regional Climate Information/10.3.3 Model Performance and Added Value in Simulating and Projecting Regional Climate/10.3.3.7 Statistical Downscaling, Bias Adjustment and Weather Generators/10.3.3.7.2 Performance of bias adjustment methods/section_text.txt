This subsection assesses the performance of bias adjustment in a perfect predictor context. In practice, climate model imperfections may cause substantial additional issues in the application of bias adjustment. These are assessed separately in Cross-Chapter Box 10.2.Bias adjustment methods, if driven by reanalysis predictors, in principle adjust well all the aspects that they intend to address (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). For temperature, all univariate methods are good for adjusting means, variance, and high quantiles (Gutiérrez et al., 2019; Hertig et al., 2019). For precipitation, means, intensities, wet-day frequencies, and wet–dry and dry–wet transitions are well-adjusted (Gutiérrez et al., 2019; Maraun et al., 2019b). The representation of high quantiles depends on the chosen method, although flexible quantile mapping performs best (Hertig et al., 2019). Empirical (non-parametric) methods perform better than parametric methods over the observed range, but it is unclear how this translates into extrapolation to unobserved values (IPCC, 2015; Hertig et al., 2019). Many quantile mapping methods overestimate interannual variability (Maraun et al., 2019b). Temporal and spatial dependence are usually not adjusted and thus inherited from the driving model (Maraun et al., 2019b; Widmann et al., 2019). Spatial fields are thus typically too smooth in space, even after bias adjustment (Widmann et al., 2019).Several studies show improved simulations of present-day impacts, when the impact model is fed with bias-adjusted climate model output, including the assessment of river discharge (Rojas et al., 2011; Muerth et al., 2013; Montroull et al., 2018), forest fires (Migliavacca et al., 2013), crop production (Ruiz-Ramos et al., 2016), and regional ocean modelling (Macias et al., 2018).There is  high confidence that bias adjustment can improve the marginal distribution of simulated climate variables, if applied to a climate model that adequately represents the processes relevant for a given application (Cross-Chapter Box 10.2).
