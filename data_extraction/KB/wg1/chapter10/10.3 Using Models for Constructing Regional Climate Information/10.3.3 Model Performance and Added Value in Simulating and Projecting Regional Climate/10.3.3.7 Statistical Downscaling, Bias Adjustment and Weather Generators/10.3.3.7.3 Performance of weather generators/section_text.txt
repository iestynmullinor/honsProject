Weather generators represent well most aspects that are explicitly calibrated. This typically includes mean, variance, high quantiles (for precipitation, if explicitly modelled), and short-term temporal variability for both temperature and precipitation, whereas interannual variability is strongly underestimated (Frost et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2013a; Keller et al., 2015; Dubrovsky et al., 2019; Guti√©rrez et al., 2019; Hertig et al., 2019; Maraun et al., 2019b; Widmann et al., 2019). There is growing evidence that some spatial weather generators fairly realistically capture the spatial dependence of temperature and precipitation (Frost et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2013a; Keller et al., 2015; Evin et al., 2018; Dubrovsky et al., 2019). There is  high confidence that weather generators can realistically simulate a wide range of local weather characteristics at single locations, but there is limited evidence and low agreement of the ability of weather generators to realistically simulate the spatial dependence of atmospheric variables across multiple sites.
