Modelling chains for generating regional climate information range from the definition of forcing scenarios to the global modelling, and potentially to dynamical or statistical downscaling and bias adjustment (Section 10.3.1). The propagation and potential accumulation of uncertainties along the chain has been termed the cascade of uncertainty (Wilby and Dessai, 2010). Even within one model, like a global model, uncertainty propagates across scales. From a process point of view, these uncertainties are related to forcings and global climate sensitivity, and errors in the representation of the large-scale circulation (Section 10.3.3.3; McNeall et al., 2016) and regional processes (Section 10.3.3.4), feedbacks (Section 10.3.3.5) and drivers (Section 10.3.3.6). From a modelling point of view, these uncertainties are related to the choice of dynamical and statistical models (Section 10.3.1) and experimental design (Section 10.3.2). The overall uncertainty can be statistically decomposed into the individual sources (Evin et al., 2019; Christensen and Kjellstr√∂m, 2020), although there might be non-linear dependencies between them.Uncertainty propagation often increases the spread in regional climate projections when comparing global model and downscaled results, which has been used as an argument against top-down approaches to climate information (Prudhomme et al., 2010). Increased spread in the modelling chain may also arise from a more comprehensive representation of previously unknown or underrepresented uncertainties (Maraun and Widmann, 2018b). The increased spread in this case goes together with a better representation of processes and thus an increased model fitness-for-purpose (Section 10.3.3.9).
