A wide variety of approaches has been proposed to combine the advantages of different statistical approaches. For instance, to overcome the scale mismatch between climate model output and observations, bias adjustment has been combined with stochastic downscaling (Volosciuk et al., 2017; Lange, 2019) or rescaled analogues (Pierce et al., 2014). Other approaches known as emulators have been developed to emulate an RCM using a statistical model and also applied to a range of driving global models (Déqué et al., 2012; Haas and Pinto, 2012; Walton et al., 2015, 2017; Beusch et al., 2020; Erlandsen et al., 2020).
