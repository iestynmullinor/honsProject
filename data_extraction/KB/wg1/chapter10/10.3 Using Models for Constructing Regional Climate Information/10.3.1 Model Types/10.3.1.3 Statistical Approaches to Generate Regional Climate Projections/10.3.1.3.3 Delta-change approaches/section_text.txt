In the delta change approach, selected observations are modified according to corresponding changes derived from dynamical model simulations. Traditionally, only long-term means have been adjusted, but recently approaches to modify temporal dependence (Webber et al., 2018) have been developed, as well as quantile mapping approaches that individually adjust quantiles of the observed distribution (Willems and Vrac, 2011). By construction, the approach cannot modify the spatial and temporal dependence structure of the input observations (Maraun, 2016).
