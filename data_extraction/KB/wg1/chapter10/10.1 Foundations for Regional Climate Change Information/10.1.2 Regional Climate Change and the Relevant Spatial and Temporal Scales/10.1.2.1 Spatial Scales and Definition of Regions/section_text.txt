Large-scale climate and the associated phenomena have been defined in Chapter 2 (e.g., Cross-Chapter Box 2.2) as ranging from global and hemispheric, to ocean basin and continental scales. The definition of the regional scale is case specific in the AR6 WGI Report. Section 1.4.5provides definitions of the different regional types adopted by the different chapters. In this chapter, regional scales are defined as ranging from the size of sub-continental areas (e.g., the Mediterranean basin) to local scales (e.g., coastlines, mountain ranges and cities) without prescribing any formal regional boundaries. These spatial length scales range from a few thousand down to a few kilometres and the relevant driving modes and processes at regional scales are summarized in Figure 10.3. In contrast to Chapters 11, 12 and Atlas, which make a region-by-region assessment of climate change, this chapter does not necessarily restrict itself to the use of the AR6 WGI Reference Regions (Section 1.4.5 and Atlas.1.3). Different regional definitions have been used in sections 10.4 and 10.6, selected for their adequacy to illustrate methodological aspects (e.g., for the attribution of long-term regional trends, regions that display such trends have been selected). Typological regions (Section 1.4.5 and Atlas.1.3) are used in Box 10.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 10.4.Figure 10.3 | Schematic diagramto display interacting spatial and temporal scales relevant to regional climate change information. Figure adapted from Orlanski (1975). The processes included in the different models and model components considered in Chapter 10 are indicated as a function of these scales. The various types of models (including global and regional climate models) for constructing regional climate information are assessed in Section 10.3.1 and Box 10.3.Open figure
