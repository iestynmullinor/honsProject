Climate services have been defined as the provision of climate information to assist decision-making (Sections 1.2.3, and 12.6, and Cross-Chapter Box 12.2). Services are expected to be based on scientifically credible information and expertise, have appropriate engagement from users and providers, have an effective access mechanism and aim at meeting the usersâ€™ needs (Hewitt et al., 2020). To achieve this, climate services synthesize context-relevant climate information addressing questions for a wide range of climate time scales. From this point of view, climate services are instruments for the production, translation and transfer of climate information and knowledge for their use in climate-informed decision-making and climate-smart policy and planning (Hewitt et al., 2012). The appropriate provision of climate services considers the diagnosis of climate information needs, the service itself and a number of good practices still under development (Vaughan et al., 2018).The preceding subsections assess research on the distillation of climate information, which is directly relevant for the development of climate services. Distillation, when implemented appropriately and interpreted with all due caveats, leads to credible climate information with a broader foundation of evidence to be used in climate services practice according to the recommendations of the Global Framework for Climate Services (Hewitt et al., 2012). As stated in Chapter 12, climate services set new scientific challenges to research. Examples of some of the challenges have been given in Chapters 1 and 12, which are complemented by the barriers to the distillation assessed in Section 10.5.3.3.
