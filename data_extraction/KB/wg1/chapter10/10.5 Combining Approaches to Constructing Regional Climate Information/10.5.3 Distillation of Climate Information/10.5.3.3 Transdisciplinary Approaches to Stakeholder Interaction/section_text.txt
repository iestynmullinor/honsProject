The transdisciplinary interaction with stakeholders has been categorized into top-down, bottom-up and interactive approaches (Berkhout et al., 2013). Traditional top-down approaches frame the research from the perspective of global climate change as a driver of regional climate risk. Bottom-up approaches, also referred to as scenario-neutral impact studies (Prudhomme et al., 2010; A. Brown et al., 2012; C. Brown et al., 2012; Culley et al., 2016) begin with the userâ€™s articulation of vulnerability in the context of climatic and non-climatic stressors, follow with the definition of key system thresholds of climatic variables, and only incorporate climate data to assess the likelihood of threshold exceedances. Bottom-up approaches are special cases of robust decision-making (Lempert et al., 2006; Lempert and Collins, 2007; Walker et al., 2013; Weaver et al., 2013), which are designed to account for uncertainties not represented by climate models as well as non-climatic stressors. Interactive approaches combine aspects of top-down and bottom-up approaches. The choice of approach depends on the context. While bottom-up approaches might be optimal in a local context, where case-specific risks are addressed, top-down approaches provide generic information that may serve a range of different purposes, for example, at the national scale (Berkhout et al., 2013). All these approaches benefit from the integration of fully distilled climate information (Berkhout et al., 2013; Maraun and Widmann, 2018b).
