As implied by (Section 10.5.2, meeting the needs of users can be a substantial challenge for climate scientists if they misunderstand or have limited understanding of user needs and context (Porter and Dessai, 2017). Several barriers in user communities can trigger and sustain this challenge. This can include an institutional aversion to incorporating new tools into decision-making (Callahan et al., 1999). Coincident with this factor, there may be limited staff capacity, lack of management support and lack of a mandate to plan for climate change (Lee and Whitely Binder, 2010).Following from those challenges, constructing and communicating regional climate information often occurs under the overarching assumption that uncertainty is a problem and reducing uncertainty is the priority (Eisenack et al., 2014; J. Otto et al., 2016). This is both a psychological (Morton et al., 2011) as well as a pragmatic barrier in cases where uncertainty appears to limit the ability to make decisions (Mukheibir and Ziervogel, 2007). However, where in-depth engagements with decision contexts are undertaken, these initial barriers are often dismantled to reveal a more complex, nuanced and potentially more productive intersection with climate information producers that can efficiently handle uncertainty (e.g., Rice et al., 2009; Lemos et al., 2012; Moss, 2016). Specifically, disclosure of all uncertainties in the climate information, transparency about the sources of these uncertainties, and tailoring the uncertainty information to specific decision frameworks have the potential for reducing problems of distilling and communicating uncertain climate information (J. Otto et al., 2016).
