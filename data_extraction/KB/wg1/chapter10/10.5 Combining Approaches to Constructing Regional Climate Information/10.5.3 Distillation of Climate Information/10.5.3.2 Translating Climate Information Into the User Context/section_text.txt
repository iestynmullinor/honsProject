Awareness and understanding of the users’ decision-making context is a central and key aspect of developing tailored, context-appropriate information (Briley et al., 2015), as clearly evidenced by the climate services’ experiences (e.g., Vincent et al., 2018). Understanding the context, however, is not trivial and requires understanding of both the user and provider (Guido et al., 2020) if the information is to be robust, reliable and relevant (Giorgi, 2020). Translating the information into context requires consideration of terminology and expectations (Briley et al., 2015), issues of user interpretation (Daron et al., 2015), and hence necessitating engagement in co-production with all attendant challenges (Vincent et al., 2021). The actual provision of climate information may be conducted at different levels of sophistication, ranging from generic data provision via web portals (Hewitson et al., 2017), potentially including impact-relevant climate indicators, region-specific factsheets and stakeholder reports, social media (Pearce et al., 2019), to a close engagement with specific stakeholders in co-exploring the research (Steynor et al., 2016).Climate information products may often lack explanations of their potential use and misuse (Street, 2016; Lamb, 2017; Chimani et al., 2020). This is particularly important if the information is provided as a generic, publicly accessible product without a specific context (Hewitson et al., 2017). Context-specific collaboration, especially if organized in workshop, enables a close transdisciplinary co-exploration of the results as in the form of climate risk narratives (Jack et al., 2020, Box 10.2). Such approaches explicitly account for the user context, values and non-climatic stressors (Steynor and Pasquini, 2019).
