There is  high confidence that distilling climate information for a specific purpose benefits from a co-production process that involves users of the information, considers the specific user context and the values of relevant actors such as users and scientists, and translates the resultant information into the broader user context. This process allows users to take ownership of the information, builds relationships and trust between information users and producers and helps to overcome barriers in the information construction. This process enhances trust in the information as well its usefulness, relevance, and uptake, especially when the communication involves complex, contextual details (high confidence). The optimal approach for the transdisciplinary collaboration with users depends on the specific context conditioned by the sources available and the actors involved, which together are dependent on the regions considered and the framing by the question being addressed.Drawing upon multiple lines of evidence in the construction of climate information increases the fitness of this information and creates a stronger foundation (high confidence). The lines of evidence can include multiple observational datasets, ensembles of different model types, process understanding, expert judgement, and indigenous knowledge, among others. Attribution studies, the characterization of possible outcomes associated with internal variability and a comprehensive assessment of observational, model and forcing uncertainties and possible contradictions using different analysis methods are important elements of distillation. To make the most appropriate decisions and responses to changing climate it is necessary to consider all physically plausible outcomes from multiple lines of evidence, especially in the case when they are contrasting such as in the examples of Cross-Chapter Box 10.1 and Section 10.6.2.
