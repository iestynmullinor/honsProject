Without considering the specific context, the distillation of climate information relevant to users may poorly serve the goal of informing adaptation and policy (Cash et al., 2003; Lemos et al., 2012; Baztan et al., 2017). Section 10.1.4 identifies three implicit framing issues of constructing and delivering user-relevant climate information: practical issues arising from the climate information sources, issues with including the context in constructing the information, and difficulties presented by complex networks of practitioners. The social context strongly influences decisions about constructing information and requires a nuanced and holistic approach to recognize the complexity of a coupled social and physical system (Daron et al., 2014). For example, urban water managers must recognize the dependency of the city on different water resources and the interplay of both local and national government legislation that can involve a range of different constituencies and decision makers (Scott et al., 2018; Savelli et al., 2021).Context plays a role in determining the risks that may affect human systems and ecosystems and consequently the climate information needs. The context may also limit access to such information. Hence, the context imposes inherent constraints on how climate information can be constructed and optimally aligned with its intended application. Although contexts are unlimited in variety, some key contextual elements include:Whether the problem formulation needs to be constructed through consultative activities that, for instance, help identify thresholds of vulnerability in complex urban or rural systems (Baztan et al., 2017; Willyard et al., 2018) or is more a matter of addressing a generic vulnerability already identified, such as the frequency of flood events or recurrence intervals of multi-year droughts (Hallegatte et al., 2013).Societal capacity, such as cultural or institutional flexibility and willingness to respond to different scientific information (e.g., Hart and Nisbet, 2012; Kahan, 2012, 2013).The technical capability and expertise of the different actors, including users, producers, and communicators (e.g., Sarewitz, 2004; Gorddard et al., 2016).Potential contrasts in value systems such as the different views of the Global North compared to those of economies in transition or under development (Henrich et al., 2010a, b; Sapiains et al., 2021).The relative importance of climate change in relation to non-climate stressors on the temporal and spatial scales of interest to the user, which at times are not the ones initially assumed by the producers (Otto et al., 2015).Availability, timing and accessibility of the required climate information, including the availability of sources such as observations, model simulations, literature and experts of the relevant regional climate (Mulwa et al., 2017). In developing countries, the availability of all or some of these sources may be limited (Dinku et al., 2014).These and other contextual elements can frame subsequent decisions about the construction of regional climate information for applications. For example, an engineer typically seeks quantitative information, while the policy community may be more responsive to storylines and how information is positioned within a causal network describing regional climate risk (Section 1.4.4 and Box 10.2). Multiple contexts can coexist and potentially result in competing approaches (for example, when urban governance contends with regional water-resource management in the same area).
