Climate processes occur on a range of spatial and temporal scales, from global to local, from centuries and longer to days or less (Section 10.1.2 and Figure 10.3). Similarly, decisions by stakeholders cover a range of spatial and temporal scales that can vary with the size of their region of interest and scope of activity. However, the link between decision scales and the spatial and temporal resolution of climate and related non-climatic, natural-system information is not straightforward, and failure to recognize mismatches between the two can undermine the effectiveness and relevance of the information (Cumming et al., 2006; Sayles, 2018).Nevertheless, the scale of regional climate information does not have to be the same as the decision scale. Physical-climate storylines (Box 10.2) valid at large scales can be used to develop understanding that is relevant to local decisions. For example, global climate change affecting Antarctic ice-mass loss is relevant to formulating Dutch responses to sea level rise (Haasnoot et al., 2020). On the other hand, extreme precipitation processes can occur on scales of tens of kilometres and smaller and thus require high resolution climate information when projecting future changes (e.g., Xie et al., 2015). An important factor for developing effective climate information using the distillation process is aligning the vulnerabilities of the social and economic systems under consideration ranging from, for example, those important to a farmer to those important to a national agricultural ministry (Andreassen et al., 2018; Oâ€™Higgins et al., 2019). Thus, more sophisticated matching of spatial and temporal resolution of climate information with decision scales requires engagement across a hierarchy of governance structures at national, regional and local level (e.g., Lagabrielle et al., 2018).
