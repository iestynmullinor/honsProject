Derived gridded datasets require merging data from different sources of observations and/or reanalysis data on a regular grid (Section 10.2.1.2; e.g., Xie and Arkin, 1997). However, in situ observations are distributed irregularly, especially over sparsely populated areas. This leads to an interpolation challenge. Gridded products of climate variables, including temperature and precipitation, are strongly affected (high confidence) by the interpolation method over complex orography and data scarce regions (Hofstra et al., 2008; Herrera et al., 2016).There are two main approaches to produce gridded datasets: (i) based on in situ observations only, and (ii) combining in situ observations with remote-sensing data and/or reanalysis data. The first approach has been widely employed in regions with high station density using interpolation techniques, such as inverse-distance weighting, optimal interpolation, and kriging (Chen et al., 2008; Haylock et al., 2008; Frei, 2014; Isotta et al., 2014; Masson and Frei, 2014; Hiebl and Frei, 2016; Nguyen-Xuan et al., 2016). The second approach has been mainly applied in data-sparse regions with low station density, using simple bias adjustment, quantile mapping, and kriging techniques with in situ observations, remote-sensing and reanalysis data (Cheema and Bastiaanssen, 2012; Erdin et al., 2012; Dinku et al., 2014; Abera et al., 2016; Kr√§henmann et al., 2018).Gridding of station data is affected by uncertainties stemming from measurement errors, inhomogeneities, the distribution of the underlying stations and the interpolation error, with station density being the dominant factor (Herrera et al., 2019). Uncertainty due to interpolation is typically small for temperature but substantial for precipitation and its derivatives, such as drought indices (Chubb et al., 2015; Hellwig et al., 2018). The largest uncertainties typically occur in sparsely sampled mountain areas (Section 10.2.2.5). Interpolation generally give rise to smoothing effects, such as low variability of the derived dataset with respect to the in situ observations (Chen et al., 2019). As a result, the effective resolution of gridded data is typically much lower than its nominal resolution. For instance, a 5 km gridded precipitation dataset for the European Alps has an effective resolution of about 10 to 25 km (Isotta et al., 2014). In an example for precipitation in Spain, the effective resolution converged to the nominal resolution only when at least 6 to 7 stations were inside the gridcell (Herrera et al., 2019). To account for the smoothing errors, new stochastic ensemble observation datasets have been introduced (Von Clarmann, 2014).
