Following some early concept studies, the first practical applications of paleoclimate data assimilation over past centuries used only selected data to reconstruct past climate changes for analysis of a specific process or case (Widmann et al., 2010). Recently, assimilation of multiple series from various data sources, including tree rings, ice cores, lake cores, corals, and bivalves, has allowed production of reconstructions that can be widely shared and applied to multiple purposes, as with modern reanalyses (Hakim et al., 2016; Franke et al., 2017; Steiger et al., 2018; Tardif et al., 2019). Most of these paleo-reanalyses are global but there are products using regional models or targeted at specific regions such as Europe, East Africa and the Indian Ocean (Fallah et al., 2018; Klein and Goosse, 2018).Paleo-reanalyses are enabling a new range of applications and have already provided useful information on seasonal-to-multi-decadal climate variability over past millennia. They are useful tools to study the co-variance between variables at interannual-to-centennial time scales and at regional to global spatial scales. In particular, they have highlighted the processes that can be responsible for changes in continental hydrology at multi-decadal time scales (Franke et al., 2017; Klein and Goosse, 2018; Steiger et al., 2018). Paleo-reanalyses have confirmed a large contribution of internal variability in past changes at regional scale during the pre-industrial period, superimposed on a weak common signal due to forcing changes (Goosse et al., 2012) and the absence of a globallycoherent warm period in the common era before the recent warming (Neukom et al., 2019). Reconstructions of the atmospheric state obtained in the reanalysis also provide robust evidence of a local enhancement of warming or cooling conditions due to changes in atmospheric circulation, such as for the warm conditions in some European regions around 950â€“1250 CE, the cooling observed in 1809/1810, or the cold and rainy 1816 summer in Europe (Cross-Chapter Box 4.1; Goosse et al., 2012; Hakim et al., 2016; Franke et al., 2017; Schurer et al., 2019).
