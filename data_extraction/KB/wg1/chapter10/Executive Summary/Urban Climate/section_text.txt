Many types of urban parametrizations simulate radiation and energy exchanges in a realistic way (very high confidence). For urban climate studies focusing on the interplay between the urban heat island and regional climate change, a simple single-layer parametrization is fit for purpose (medium confidence). New networks of monitoring stations in urban areas provide key information to enhance the understanding of urban microclimates and improve urban parametrizations. {Box 10.3}The difference in observed warming trends between cities and their surroundings can partly be attributed to urbanization (very high confidence). Annual mean daily minimum temperature is more affected by urbanization than annual mean daily maximum temperature (very high confidence). The global annual mean surface air temperature response to urbanization is, however, negligible (very high confidence). {Box 10.3}Future urbanization will amplify the projected air temperature change in cities regardless of the characteristics of the background climate, resulting in a warming signal on minimum temperatures that could be as large as the global warming signal (very high confidence). A large effect is expected from the combination of future urban development and more frequent occurrence of extreme climatic events, such as heatwaves (very high confidence). {Box 10.3}
