South Africa and the Cape Town region have good instrumental weather data. Records start in the late 1800s, with in excess of 10 gauges reporting since the 1920s, expanding to about 80 gauges in the 1980s, but the number of stations has declined since. The mountains have only a few stations, which receive more than 1000 mm per year. In view of the strong heterogeneity of rainfall, changes in the number of stations contributing to datasets such as Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Global Precipitation Climatology Project results in a lack of consistency between them, which limits their reliability in the region (Section 10.2; Wolski et al., 2021).
