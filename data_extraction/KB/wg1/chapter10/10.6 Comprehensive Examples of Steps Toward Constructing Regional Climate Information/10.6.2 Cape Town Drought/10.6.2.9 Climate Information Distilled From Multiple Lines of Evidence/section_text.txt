There is  high agreement among observational data and reanalyses that the recent (post-1979) downward trend in the Cape Town region’s rainfall leading to the 2015–2017 drought is related to the hemispheric processes of poleward shift in the westerlies and expansion of the Hadley circulation. However, there is less support for the precipitation–circulation relationship in historical CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations. As a consequence, there is only medium confidence that these process changes produced the 2015–2017 drought leading to the 2018 water crisis.For the water-resource planner who has to deal with potential drought like the 2015–2017 event, several lines of evidence indicate future drying: the projected precipitation by global models and RCMs of different spatial resolutions, and the observed and projected changes of circulation patterns consistent with drier conditions, the paleoclimatic evidence confirming a millennial-scale circulation–rainfall link. However, the distillation is limited by a lack of information about whether or not a relationship between Cape Town precipitation and large-scale circulation processes adequately explains droughts in the twentieth century prior to 1979.Thus, although a clear association appears in observations from 1979 onward between increasing GHG concentrations, drying in the Cape Town region and behaviour of a key circulation process, the SAM, further analysis suggests caution. Not all global models show the historical post-1979 association among these factors, and when the observational record is extended back further to times when the anthropogenic greenhouse forcing was weaker, there is no strong association between the SAM and Cape Town drought. Thus, there is only medium confidence in the expectation of a future drier climate for Cape Town.
