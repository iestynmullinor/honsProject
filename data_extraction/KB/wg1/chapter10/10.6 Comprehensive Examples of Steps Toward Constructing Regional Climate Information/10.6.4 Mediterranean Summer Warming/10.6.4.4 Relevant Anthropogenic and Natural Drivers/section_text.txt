The Mediterranean summer climate is affected by large-scale modes of natural variability, the most dominant being the NAO (Annex IV) in winter and the summer NAO in summer (Folland et al., 2009; Bladé et al., 2012), although regional differences exist. The influence of those modes of variability over the eastern Mediterranean is recognized by some studies (Chronis et al., 2011; Kahya, 2011; Black, 2012; Bladé et al., 2012), but disputed by others (Ben-Gai et al., 2001; Ziv et al., 2006; Donat et al., 2014; Turki et al., 2016; Zamrane et al., 2016; Han et al., 2019). During positive summer NAO phase, associated with an upper-level trough over the Balkans, the Mediterranean is anomalously wet (Bladé et al., 2012). Drivers of Mediterranean climate variability include modes of variability such as the AMV (Sutton and Dong, 2012) and the Asian monsoon (Rodwell and Hoskins, 1996; Logothetis et al., 2020). In addition, the increase of GHGs (e.g., Zittis et al., 2019), the decrease of anthropogenic aerosols over Europe and the Mediterranean since the 1980s resulting from air pollution policies (Turnock et al., 2016), and anthropogenic land-use change (Millán, 2014; MedECC 2020) have been shown to be linked to the regional warming. The role of the zonal averaged circulation as a driver for the Mediterranean climate has been stressed by (Garfinkel et al., 2020).The attribution of observed Mediterranean summer warming to above drivers and implications for future projections will be discussed in Sections 10.6.4.5 and 10.6.4.6.
