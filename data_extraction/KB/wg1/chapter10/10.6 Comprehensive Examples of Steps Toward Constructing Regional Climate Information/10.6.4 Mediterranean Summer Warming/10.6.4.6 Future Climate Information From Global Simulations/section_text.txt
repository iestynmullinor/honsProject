The Mediterranean is expected to be one of the most prominent and vulnerable climate change hotspots (Diffenbaugh and Giorgi, 2012). CMIP5, CMIP6, HighResMIP and CORDEX (Section 10.6.4.7) simulations all project a future warming for the 21st century that ranges between 3.5°C and 8.75°C for RCP8.5 at the end of this century for those ending at 2100 (Figure 10.21a, b). CMIP6 results project more pronounced warming than CMIP5 for a given emissions scenario and time period (Figure 10.21c; Coppola et al., 2020). However, when analysing the Mediterranean warming in terms of mean global warming levels, the two ensembles largely agree, showing that summer warming is projected to reach values up to 40–50% larger than the global annual warming, largely independent of models and emissions scenarios (Figure 10.21d). Large regional differences exist, with enhanced warming projected over Turkey, the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula and North African regions (Figures 10.14a, 10.21c; Almazroui et al., 2020a) and reaching, locally, values of up to double the global mean (Lionello and Scarascia, 2018). The enhanced summer warming also increases the amplitude of the seasonal cycle (Yettella and England, 2018).Figure  10.20 | Aspects of Mediterranean summer warming.

Dark blue, brown and turquoise lines show low-pass filtered temperature of Berkeley Earth, CRU TS and HadCRUT5, respectively. Orange, light blue and green lines show low-pass filtered ensemble means of HighResMIP (4 members), CORDEX EUR-44 (20 members) and CORDEX EUR-11 (37 members). Blue and red lines and shadings show low-pass filtered ensemble means and standard deviations of CMIP5 (41 members) and CMIP6 (36 members). The filter is the same as the one used in Figure 10.10.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 10.SM.11). Open figureAs noted in Section 10.6.4.4, the Mediterranean summer climate is affected by large-scale circulation patterns, of which the summer NAO is the most important (Folland et al., 2009; Bladé et al., 2012). Barcikowska et al. (2020) highlight the importance of correctly simulating the summer NAO impact on the Mediterranean climate, as it partly offsets the anthropogenic warming signal in the western and central Mediterranean.Climate models project a reduction in precipitation in all seasons, and a northward and eastward expansion of the Mediterranean climate, with the affected areas becoming more arid with an increased summer drying (Atlas.8.5; Alessandri et al., 2015; Mariotti et al., 2015; Rajczak and Schär, 2017; Waha et al., 2017; Barredo et al., 2018; Lionello and Scarascia, 2018; Spinoni et al., 2018, 2020). The drying can contribute to the enhanced warming by land surface feedbacks (Whan et al., 2015; Lorenz et al., 2016; Russo et al., 2019). A negative feedback to this dryness-induced warming might be provided by an enhanced moisture transport into the dry area associated with the dynamical response of the atmosphere (Zhou et al., 2021). Due to the arid climate, no positive soil moisture-temperature feedback is found over the North African regions of the Mediterranean, where the surface energy budget is mostly governed by radiative cooling (Lelieveld et al., 2016), implying that soil moisture feedbacks are not contributing to enhanced warming over those regions.Over the Mediterranean region, daily maximum temperature is projected to increase more than the daily minimum. Consequently, the difference between daytime maxima and nighttime minima is expected to increase, particularly in summer (Lionello and Scarascia, 2018). Temperature extremes will be affected as well, with a dramatic increase in the number of warm days and reduction of cold nights (Section 11.9; Lionello and Scarascia, 2020). The Mediterranean summer warming will also increase the frequency and intensity of heatwaves (Section 11.9).
