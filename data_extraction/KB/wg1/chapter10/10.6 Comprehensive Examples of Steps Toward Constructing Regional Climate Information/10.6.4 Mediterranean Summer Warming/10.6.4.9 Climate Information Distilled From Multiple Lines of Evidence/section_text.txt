There is very high confidence (high agreement, robust evidence) that the Mediterranean region has experienced a summer temperature increase in recent decades that is faster than the increase for the Northern Hemisphere summer mean. There is also very high confidence (high agreement, robust evidence) that the projected Mediterranean summer temperature increase will be larger than the global warming level, with an increase in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves.Traditionally, the distillation process to produce contextualized, policy relevant information has taken place at regional or national level. For example, the potential effects of climate change on public health are discussed in several national climate change and adaptation reports (Bruci et al., 2016; MoARE, 2016; MoE, 2016; MoEP, 2018; MoEU, 2018). Although these reports are extremely helpful and widely used for the development of national adaptation policies, they are often based on non-comprehensive and heterogeneous sources of climate information (e.g., MEEN, 2018; MoE/UNDP/GEF, 2019). For instance, future climate change projections are based on a limitednumber of socio-economic scenarios and climate model simulations, which are also often not evaluated comprehensively (e.g., Bruci et al., 2016; MoARE, 2016; MoEU, 2018). In addition, these reports are often not peer-reviewed, not availablein English, and mainly limited to the country level, thus making it difficult to compare the details of the climate information across them.
