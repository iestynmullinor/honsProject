The Mediterranean has a heterogeneous climate that is partly semi-arid, especially along the southern coast of the Mediterranean Sea (Lionello et al., 2012). It is characterized by mild humid winters and dry warm or hot summers, which are associated with large scale subsidence that is partly related to the downward branch of the Hadley circulation. Other factors affecting the Mediterranean circulation include the monsoon heating over Asia (Rodwell and Hoskins, 1996; Cherchi et al., 2014; Oss√≥ et al., 2019) and circulation anomalies induced by topography (Simpson et al., 2015). Seasonal and interannual variability is strongly linked to natural modes of variability (Section 10.6.4.4). The Mediterranean Sea acts as an evaporation source that dominates the regional hydrological cycle, which is characterized by local cyclogenesis and a separate branch of the mid-latitude storm track (Lionello et al., 2016). It also affects remote locations such as the Sahel (Park et al., 2016; Section 10.4.2.1). Strong storms can develop over the Mediterranean. Among these, Medicanes are particularly destructive and exhibit several similarities with tropical cyclones (Cavicchia et al., 2014; Kouroutzoglou et al., 2015; Gaertner et al., 2018). The Mediterranean region is also characterized by strong land-atmosphere coupling and feedbacks (Seneviratne et al., 2006) generating prolonged droughts and intense heatwaves, which can also affect continental Europe (Zampieri et al., 2009). Other aspects of Mediterranean climate include regional winds, which can be very strong due to the channelling effect (Obermann et al., 2018) and extreme rainfall during autumn (Ducrocq et al., 2014; Ribes et al., 2019).
