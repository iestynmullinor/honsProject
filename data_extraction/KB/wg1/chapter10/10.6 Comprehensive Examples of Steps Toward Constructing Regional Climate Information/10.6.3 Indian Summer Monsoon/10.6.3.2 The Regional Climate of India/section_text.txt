Local geography gives rise to distinct differences in societal experience of the summer monsoon. The south-westerly monsoon winds are incident upon the Western Ghats mountains on the west coast, leading to orographic enhancement and heavy rains (Shige et al., 2017), which supply rivers with water for much of the southern peninsula, often the subject of inter-regional water disputes. The northern plains contain the Ganges river and also Indiaâ€™s most intensive agriculture, both rainfed and irrigated. Synoptic systems known as monsoon depressions cross the northern east coast, supplying much of the rain in central India (Hunt and Fletcher, 2019). Further north, the eastern Himalayas are dominated by the summer monsoon, while the western Himalayas receive most rainfall from western disturbances during winter (Palazzi et al., 2013). Meanwhile, south-eastern India sits under a rain shadow (the only region to receive more rainfall during the winter monsoon).
