Formal storyline approaches (see Box 10.2) have been used infrequently for the Indian summer monsoon, representing a knowledge gap. In an expert-elicitation approach (Dessai et al., 2018), physically plausible futures substantiated by climate processes were constructed, focusing on a river basin in southern India. Possible outcomes were framed based on changes in two drivers: availability of moisture from the Arabian Sea and strength of the low-level flow. The narratives identified were able to explain 70% of the variance in monsoon rainfall over 1979–2013, the implication being that climate uncertainties could be easily communicated to stakeholders in the context of present-day variability.The storylines terminology could be used to loosely describe the interplay between internal variability and forced change (see Section 10.6.3.6), such as considering the difference between groups of wettest and driest ensemble members of a SMILE for the near-term future in Figure 10.19f. However, given the interest in low-likelihood high-impact scenarios (Sutton, 2018), we can also consider possible storylines for the Indian monsoon constructed from evidence in paleoclimate records and modelling. For example, a future AMOC collapse could cause reduced monsoon rainfall (Section 8.6.1; Liu et al., 2017), offsetting increases expected due to GHG. Large tropical volcanic eruptions are also known to weaken the Asian summer monsoon, in observations and model simulations over the last millennium (Section 8.5.2.3; Zambri et al., 2017), although a hemispheric dependence is found, with Southern Hemisphere eruptions even strengthening the monsoon around India (Zuo et al., 2019). Typically, future climate projections do not consider plausible eruption scenarios and their mitigating effects on greenhouse warming (see also Cross-Chapter Box 4.1). A single-model ensemble (Bethke et al., 2017) demonstrates a future drier Indian monsoon relative to conditions in which volcanic eruptions are not considered, although the effects of GHG warming dominate beyond the mid-term.The few studies on low-likelihood high-impact scenarios, often in single models, together with findings in SR1.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), noting the small radiative forcing in 1.5°C or 2°C scenarios, or the absence of large aerosol emissions at the end of the 21st century in RCPs, give us low confidence in abrupt changes to the monsoon on this time scale.
