The relevant drivers for long-term change in the mean Indian summer monsoon are summarized briefly:Increased greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations (chiefly CO2) are a strong contributor to changes in the monsoon, with repercussions for the meridional temperature contrast driving the monsoon circulation (Ueda et al., 2006; Roxy et al., 2015), for the monsoon winds in the lower troposphere (Cherchi et al., 2011; Krishnan et al., 2013), or for the availability of moisture from the Indian Ocean (May, 2011).Industrial emissions of sulphate aerosol predominantly in the Northern Hemisphere could change inter-hemispheric energy transports and weaken the monsoon (Polson et al., 2014; Undorf et al., 2018). The effect of local anthropogenic emissions of black carbon (chiefly from cooking fires) is uncertain (Lau and Kim, 2006; Nigam and Bollasina, 2010).India’s green revolution over the late-20th century led to considerable land-use change, with massive expansion of agriculture at the expense of forest and shrublands. As a result, India’s northern plains feature widespread irrigation, suggested to be a cause of drying (Mathur and AchutaRao, 2020).Decadal modes of variability such as the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV, Annex IV) and Atlantic Multi-decadal Variability (AMV, Annex IV), which may be partly forced (Section 3.7.7), are known to cause decadal modulation of the monsoon (Krishnamurthy and Krishnamurthy, 2014; Naidu et al., 2020).The interplay of these external and internal drivers is key to understanding past and future monsoon change.
