Global land precipitation will continue to increase in line with GSAT under high emissions scenarios (medium confidence). Precipitation changes over land show larger variability and a less clear signal than global total precipitation. Caesar et al. (2013) showed that under the CMIP5 extension simulations, HadGEM2-ES projected global land precipitation to remain roughly the same in RCP2.6, to increase by about 4% in RCP4.5 and to increase by about 7% in RCP8.5. Their results showed global precipitation increasing linearly with temperature while radiative forcing increases, but then more quickly if forcing is stabilized or reduced. This backs up findings of an intensification of the hydrological cycle following CO2 decrease which has been attributed to a build-up of ocean heat (Wu et al., 2010), and to a fast atmospheric adjustment to CO2 radiative forcing (Cao et al., 2011). Figure 4.40 shows that global land precipitation increases in CMIP6 models until 2300 for SSP5-8.5 but stabilizes in SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-3.4-OS. SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-3.4-OS are not distinguishable in behaviour of projected global land precipitation after 2100.
