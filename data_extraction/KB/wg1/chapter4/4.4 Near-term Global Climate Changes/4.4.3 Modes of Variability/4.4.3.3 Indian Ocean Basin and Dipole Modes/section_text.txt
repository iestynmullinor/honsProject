Important modes of interannual climate variability with pronounced climate impacts in the Africaâ€“Indo-Pacific areas of the globe are the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which is closely related to, and often coincides with, ENSO phases (Stuecker et al., 2017), and the Indian Ocean basin (IOB) mode. This is often described as a capacitor effect in response to ENSO (Xie et al., 2009; Du et al., 2013) and can feed back onto ENSO evolution (Cai et al., 2019). IOD and IOB are extensively described in Annex IV (Section AIV2.4).The projected climate mean state changes in the tropical Indian Ocean resemble a positive IOD state, with faster warming in the west compared to the east. This mean state change will potentially lead to a reduction in the amplitude of IOD events, albeit with no robust change in IOD frequency (Cai et al., 2014b). There is no robust evidence yet suggesting a cessation of IOD variability or a significant change in the IOB mode in the near-term.
