Climate variability of the Pacific Ocean on decadal and inter-decadal time scales is described in terms of a number of quasi-oscillatory SST patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO; Mantua et al., 1997) and the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO; Folland, 2002), which are referred to as the Pacific Decadal Variability (PDV; Newman et al., 2016). PDV comprises an inter-hemispheric pattern that varies at decadal to inter-decadal time scales (Figure 3.35). However, although the spatial domains to derive the IPO and PDO indices differ, and despite uncertainty related to trend removal and time-filtering (Newman et al., 2016; Tung et al., 2019), the IPO and PDO are highly correlated in time and they will be assessed together as the PDV (Annex IV, Section AIV.2.6).The AR5 assessed that near-term predictions of PDV (then referred to as PDO or IPO) were largely model dependent (Mochizuki et al., 2012; van Oldenborgh et al., 2012), not robust to sampling of initialization start-dates, overall not statistically significant, and worse than persistence (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013), although some studies showed positive skill for PDV (Mochizuki et al., 2010; Chikamoto et al., 2013). The CMIP5 decadal-prediction ensemble yielded no prediction skill of SST over the key PDV centres of action in the Pacific Ocean, both at two-to-five-year and six-to-nine-year forecast averages (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2013; Guemas et al., 2013; Boer and Sospedra-Alfonso, 2019).Since AR5, the processes causing the multi-decadal variability in the Pacific Ocean have become better understood (Newman et al., 2016; Henley, 2017). However, the relative importance oftropical and extratropical processes underlying PDV remains unclear; although it seems to be stochastically driven rather than self-excited (Liu, 2012; Liu and Di Lorenzo, 2018), the South Pacific being a key region for the tropical branch of PDV (Chung et al., 2019; Liguori and Di Lorenzo, 2019).Because PDV represents not one, but many dynamical processes, it represents a challenge as a target for near-term climate predictions and projections. The new generation of decadal forecast systems keeps showing poor (Shaffrey et al., 2017) to moderate (D.M. Smith et al., 2019) multi-year prediction skill for PDV, although the potential for forecasting capabilities is demonstrated in case studies (Meehl and Teng, 2012; Meehl et al., 2014). For the near-term, a transition of PDV from the negative phase (1999–2012) towards a positive phase is predicted in the coming years (2013–2022; Meehl et al., 2016).The PDV has been shown to influence the pace of global warming (Cross-Chapter Box 3.1), but the extent to which PDV is externally forced or internally generated (Mann et al., 2020) remains an open question, and there is still no robust evidence. Thus, there is low confidence on how the PDV will evolve in the near-term (Bordbar et al., 2019).
