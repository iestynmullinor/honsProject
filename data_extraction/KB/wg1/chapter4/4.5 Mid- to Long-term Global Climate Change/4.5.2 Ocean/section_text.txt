The model-simulated, long-term trend of ocean acidification is assessed in Section 4.3.2.5 and Chapter 5 (Section 5.3.4.1). It is virtually certain that surface ocean acidification will continue in response to the rise in atmospheric CO2, and continued penetration of anthropogenic CO2 from the surface to the deep ocean will acidify the ocean interior (Figure 4.29). By the end of this century, under SSP3-7.0, a pH reduction of about 0.3 is found at a few hundred metres depth of the global ocean, with stronger acidification in the interior North Atlantic and the mid- to high-latitude Southern Ocean. At a depth of about 1 km, a pH reduction of about 0.1 is found.Figure 4.29 | Long-term change of annual and zonal ocean pH. Displayed are multi-model mean change in annual and zonal ocean pH in 2081–2100 relative to themean of 1995–2014 for SSP1-2.6 and SSP3-7.0, respectively. Eleven CMIP6 model results are used. Diagonal lines indicate regions where fewer than 80% of the models agree on the sign of the change and no overlay where at least 80% of the models agree on the sign of change. Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 4.SM.1). Open figureProjections with CMIP6 ESMs (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020) show a surface pH decline of –0.16 ± 0.002 (±1 standard deviation) under SSP1-2.6 and –0.44 ± 0.005 under SSP5-8.5 from 1870–1899 to 2080–2099. The high-latitude oceans, in particular the Arctic, show greater decline in pH and accelerated acidification (Terhaar et al., 2020). For the same period, model-projected bottom-water pH decline is –0.018 ± 0.001 under SSP1-2.6 and –0.030 ± 0.002 under SSP5-8.5. The projected large-scale surface ocean acidification will be primarily determined by the pathway of atmospheric CO2, with weak dependence on change in climate (high confidence) (Section 5.3.4.1; Hurd et al., 2018). However, for a given atmospheric CO2 scenario, uncertainty in projected ocean acidification increases with ocean depth because of model-simulated differences in ocean circulation that transports anthropogenic CO2 from the surface to bottom ocean (high confidence) (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). For example, projected surface pH fully separates between SSPs scenarios before 2050, but some overlap across SSPs is still found for projected bottom-water pH in 2080 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2020).
