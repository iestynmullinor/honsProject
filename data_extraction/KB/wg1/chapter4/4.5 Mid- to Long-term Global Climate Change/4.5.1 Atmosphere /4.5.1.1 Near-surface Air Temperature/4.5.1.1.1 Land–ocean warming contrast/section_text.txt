It is virtually certain that future average warming will be higher over land than over the ocean. Section 2.2.1 of SRCCL (G. Jia et al., 2019) assessed that it is certain that land temperatures have increased more than global mean temperatures since the pre-industrial period. This so-called land–ocean warming contrast is a striking feature of observed trends (Lambert and Chiang, 2007; Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018) and projected changes in surface-air temperature (Sutton et al., 2007; Joshi and Gregory, 2008; Dong et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2011; Drost et al., 2012; Bayr and Dommenget, 2013; Byrne and O’Gorman, 2013b; Izumi et al., 2013; Joshi et al., 2013). Between 1979 and 2016, average temperature over land increased by 42% more than over the ocean (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2018). A similar warming contrast is found in CMIP5 projections though with large differences across models and latitudes (Sutton et al., 2007; Drost et al., 2012; Byrne and O’Gorman, 2013b; Joshi et al., 2013), which is also consistent with paleoclimate evidence (Izumi et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2014). The ratio of land-to-ocean warming is greater than one for almost all regions (high confidence) and is larger for dry subtropical continents (about 1.5) than for moist regions in the tropics and mid-latitudes (about 1.2; Byrne and O’Gorman, 2013a). Projected warming over land and ocean only is shown in Table 4.2 for different scenarios, and the global average ratio of land-to-ocean warming in CMIP6 is 1.5 with a likely range of 1.4 to 1.7, which is consistent with estimates based on CMIP5.Since AR5, a robust physical understanding of the warming contrast been developed. A simple theory based on atmospheric dynamics and moisture transport shows that surface-air temperature and relative humidity over land are strongly coupled, and demonstrates that the warming contrast occurs because air over land is drier than over the ocean (Joshi et al., 2008; Byrne and O’Gorman, 2013a, b, 2018). The warming contrast causes land relative humidity to decrease (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2016, 2018; Chadwick et al., 2016) and this feeds back on and strengthens the warming contrast. Differences in land-relative humidity responses across models are the primary cause of uncertainty in the land–ocean warming contrast (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2013b). These land-relative humidity changes are ultimately controlled by moisture transport between the land and ocean boundary layers (Byrne and O’Gorman, 2016; Chadwick et al., 2016) and are also sensitive to characteristics of land surfaces that are challenging to model, including stomatal conductance and soil moisture (Berg et al., 2016; Zarakas et al., 2020).
