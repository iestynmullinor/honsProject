Modelling studies have consistently shown that SRM has the potential to offset some effect of increasing GHGs on global and regional climate (high confidence), but there would be substantial residual or overcompensating climate change at the regional scale and seasonal time scale (high confidence). Large uncertainties associated with aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions persist in our understanding of climate response to aerosol-based SRM options. For the same amount of global mean cooling, different SRM options would cause different patterns of climate change (medium confidence). Modelling studies suggest that it is conceptually possible to achieve multiple climate policy goals by optimally designed SRM strategies.The effect of SRM options on global temperature and precipitation response would be detectable after one or two decades, which is similar to the time scale for the detection of strong mitigation. There is  high confidence that a sudden and sustained termination of a high level of SRM against a high-GHG background would cause a rapid increase in temperature at a rate that far exceeds that projected for climate change without SRM. However, a gradual phase-out of SRM combined with mitigation and CDR would more likely than not avoid large rates of warming.
