Surface-based albedo modification could, in principle, achieve a negative radiative forcing of a few W mâ€“2 by enhancing the albedo of the ocean surface (Gabriel et al., 2017; Kravitz et al., 2018). However, the technology does not exist today to increase ocean albedo at large scale. An increase in crop albedo or roof albedo in urban areas could help to reduce warming in densely populated and important agricultural regions, but the effect would be limited to local scales and ineffective at counteracting global warming (Crook et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). Large changes in desert albedo could in principle result in substantial global cooling, but would severely alter the hydrological cycle (Crook et al., 2015).In addition to above-mentioned SRM methods, a number of local intervention methods have been proposed to limit the loss of cryosphere, such as applying reflective materials over sea ice (Field et al., 2018), pumping seawater on top of the ice surface (Desch et al., 2017; Zampieri and Goessling, 2019), depositing a massive amount of snow over ice sheets (Feldmann et al., 2019), and blocking warm seawater from reaching glaciers (J.C. Moore et al., 2018). The stabilization of ice sheets through local intervention methods would reduce sea level commitment (Section 9.6.3.5). However, these methods are subject to large uncertainty concerning their feasibility and effectiveness, and their effects would be largely localized.
