A hypothetical, sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a world with high GHG concentrations has been simulated to cause climate rebound effects such as rapid increase in global temperature, precipitation, and sea level, and rapid reduction in sea ice area (Jones et al., 2013; McCusker et al., 2014; Crook et al., 2015; Muri et al., 2018). Model simulations also show reduced precipitation over land areas in the first few years following termination, indicating general drying that would exacerbate the effects of rapid warming (McCusker et al., 2014). A sudden and sustained termination of SRM is also expected to weaken carbon sinks, accelerating atmospheric CO2 accumulation andwarming (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Muri et al., 2018; Plazzotta et al., 2019). A gradual phase-out of SRM combined with mitigation and CDR could reduce the large warming rates from sudden SRM termination (MacMartin et al., 2014; Keith and MacMartin, 2015; Tilmes et al., 2016), though this would be limited by how rapidly emission reductions can be scaled up (Ekholm and Korhonen, 2016).
