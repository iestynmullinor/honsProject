Earth system modelling experiments since AR5 confirm that the zero CO2  emissions commitment (the additional rise in GSAT after all CO2  emissions cease) is small (likely less than 0.3°C in magnitude) on decadal time scales, but that it may be positive or negative.  There is low confidence in the sign of the zero CO2 emissions commitment. Consistent with SR1.5, the central estimate is taken as zero for assessments of remaining carbon budgets for global warming levels of 1.5°C or 2°C. {4.7.2, 5.5.2}.Overshooting specific global warming levels such as 2°C has effects on the climate system that persist beyond 2100 (medium confidence). Under one scenario including a peak and decline in atmospheric CO2 concentration (SSP5-3.4-OS), some climate metrics such as GSAT begin to decline but do not fully reverse by 2100 to levels prior to the CO2 peak (medium confidence). GMSL continues to rise in all models up to 2100 despite a reduction in CO2 to 2040 levels. {4.6.3, 4.7.1, 4.7.2}Using extended scenarios beyond 2100, projections show likely  warming by 2300, relative to 1850-1900, of 1.0°C-2.2°C for SSP1-2.6 and 6.6°C-14.1°C for SSP5-8.5. By 2300, warming under the SSP5-3.4-OS overshoot scenario decreases from a peak around year 2060 to a level very similar to SSP1-2.6. Precipitation over land continues to increase strongly under SSP5-8.5. GSAT projected for the end of the 23rd century under SSP2-4.5 (likely 2.3°C–4.6°C higher than over the period 1850–1900) has not been experienced since the mid-Pliocene, about 3 million years ago. GSAT projected for the end of the 23rd century under SSP5-8.5 (likely 6.6°C–14.1°C higher than over the period 1850–1900) overlaps with the range estimated for the Miocene Climatic Optimum (5°C–10°C higher) and Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (10°C–18°C higher), about 15 and 50 million years ago, respectively (medium confidence). {2.3.1.1, 4.7.1}
