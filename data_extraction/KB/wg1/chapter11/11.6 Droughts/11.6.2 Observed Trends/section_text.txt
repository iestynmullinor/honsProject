Few AR6 regions show observed increases in meteorological drought (Section 11.9), mostly in Africa and South America (NES:  high confidence; WAF, CAF, ESAF, SAM, SWS, SSA, SAS: medium confidence); a few others show a decrease (WSB, ESB, NAU, CAU, NEU, CNA: medium confidence). There are stronger signals indicating observed increases in agricultural and ecological drought (Section 11.9), which highlights the role of increased ET, driven by increased AED, for these trends (Sections 11.6.2.3 and11.6.2.5). Past increases in agricultural and ecological droughts are found on all continents and several regions (WAF, CAF, WSAF, ESAF, WCA, ECA, EAS, SAU, MED, WCE, NES: medium confidence), while decreases are found only in one AR6 region (NAU: medium confidence). The more limited availability of datasets makes it more difficult to assess historical trends in hydrological drought at regional scale (Section 11.9). Increasing (MED:  high confidence; WAF, EAS, SAU: medium confidence) and decreasing (NEU, SES: medium confidence) trends in hydrological droughts have only been observed in a few regions.In summary, there is  high confidence that AED has increased on average on continents, contributing to increased ET and resulting water stress during periods with precipitation deficits, in particular during dry seasons. There is medium confidence in increases in precipitation deficits in a few regions of Africa and South America. Based on multiple evidence, there is medium confidence that agricultural and ecological droughts have increased in several regions on all continents (WAF, CAF, WSAF, ESAF, WCA, ECA, EAS, SAU, MED, WCE, NES: medium confidence), while there is only medium confidence in decreases in one AR6 region (NAU). More severe hydrological droughts are found in fewer regions (MED:  high confidence; WAF, EAS, SAU: medium confidence).
