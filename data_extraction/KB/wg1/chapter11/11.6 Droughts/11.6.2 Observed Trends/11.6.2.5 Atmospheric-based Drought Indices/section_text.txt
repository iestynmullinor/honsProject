Globally, trends in SPEI-PM and PDSI-PM suggest slightly higher increases of drought frequency and severity in regions affected by drying over the last decades in comparison to the SPI (Dai and Zhao, 2017; Spinoni et al., 2019; Song et al., 2020), mainly in regions of Western and Southern Africa, the Mediterranean and East Asia (Figure 11.17), which is consistent with observed soil moisture trends (Section 11.6.2.3). These indices suggest that AED has contributed to increase the severity of agricultural and ecological droughts compared to meteorological droughts (García-Herrera et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2020), reduce soil moisture during the dry season (Padrón et al., 2020), increase plant water stress (Allen et al., 2015; Grossiord et al., 2020; Solander et al., 2020) and trigger more severe forest fires (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016; Turco et al., 2019; Nolan et al., 2020). A number of regional studies based on these drought indices have also shown stronger drying trends in comparison to trends in precipitation-based indices in the following AR6 regions (see also Section 11.9): NSA (R. Fu et al., 2013; Marengo and Espinoza, 2016), SCA (Hidalgo et al., 2017), WCA (Tabari and Aghajanloo, 2013; Sharafati et al., 2020), SAS (Niranjan Kumar et al., 2013), NEAF (Zeleke et al., 2017), WSAF (Edossa et al., 2016), NWN and NEN (Bonsal et al., 2013), EAS (Yu et al., 2014; Chen and Sun, 2015b; L. Li et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Z. Wu et al., 2020) and MED (Kelley et al., 2015; Stagge et al., 2017; González-Hidalgo et al., 2018; Mathbout et al., 2018a).
