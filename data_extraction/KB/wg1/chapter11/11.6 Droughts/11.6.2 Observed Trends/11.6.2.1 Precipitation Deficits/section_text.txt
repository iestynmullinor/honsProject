Strong precipitation deficits have been recorded in recent decades in the Amazon (2005, 2010), south-western China (2009–2010), south-western North America (2011–2014), Australia (1997–2009), California (2014), the middle East (2012–2016), Chile (2010–2015), the Great Horn of Africa (2011), among others (van Dijk et al., 2013; Mann and Gleick, 2015; Rowell et al., 2015; Marengo and Espinoza, 2016; Dai and Zhao, 2017; Garreaud et al., 2017, 2020; Marengo et al., 2017; Brito et al., 2018; Cook et al., 2018). Global studies generally show no significant trends in SPI time series (Orlowsky and Seneviratne, 2013; Spinoni et al., 2014), and in derived drought frequency and severity data (Spinoni et al., 2019), with very few regional exceptions (Section 11.9 and Figure 11.17). Long-term decreases in precipitation are found in some AR6 regions in Africa (Central Africa and East Southern Africa), and several regions in South America (North-Eastern South America, South American Monsoon, South-Western South America, and Southern South America) (Section 11.9). Evidence of precipitation-based drying trends is also found in Western Africa, consistent with studies based on CDD trends (Figure 11.17; Chaney et al., 2014; Donat et al., 2014b; Barry et al., 2018; Dunn et al., 2020), however, there is a partial recovery of the rainfall trends since the 1980s in this region (Section 10.4.2.1). Some AR6 regions show a decrease in meteorological drought, including Northern Australia, Central Australia, Northern Europe and Central North America (Section 11.9). Other regions either do not show substantial trends in long-term meteorological drought, or they display mixed signals depending on the considered time frame and sub-regions, such as in Southern Australia (Gallant et al., 2013; Delworth and Zeng, 2014; Alexander and Arblaster, 2017; Spinoni et al., 2019; Dunn et al., 2020; Rauniyar and Power, 2020) and the Mediterranean (Camuffo et al., 2013; Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 2016; Spinoni et al., 2017; Stagge et al., 2017; Caloiero et al., 2018; Peña-Angulo et al., 2020b; see also Section 11.9 and Atlas.8.2).Figure 11.17 | Observed linear trend for (a) consecutive dry days (CDD) during 1960–2018, (b) standardized precipitation index (SPI) and (c) standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI) during 1951–2016. CDD data are from the HadEx3 dataset (Dunn et al., 2020), trend calculation of CDD as in Figure 11.9. Drought severity is estimated using 12-month SPI (SPI-12) and 12-month SPEI (SPEI-12). SPI and SPEI datasets are from Spinoni et al. (2019). The threshold to identify drought episodes was set at -1 SPI/SPEI units. Areas without sufficient data are shown in grey. No overlay indicates regions where the trends are significant at the p = 0.1 level. Crosses indicate regions where trends are not significant.
