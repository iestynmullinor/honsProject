There is evidence based on streamflow records of increased hydrological droughts in East Asia (D. Zhang et al., 2018) and southern Africa (Gudmundsson et al., 2019). In areas of Western and Central Europe and Northern Europe, there is no evidence of changes in the severity of hydrological droughts since 1950 based on flow reconstructions (Caillouet et al., 2017; Barker et al., 2019) and observations (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2019). In the Mediterranean region, there is  high confidence in hydrological drought intensification (Section 11.9; Giuntoli et al., 2013; Lorenzo-Lacruz et al., 2013; Gudmundsson et al., 2019). In south-eastern South America there is a decrease in the severity of hydrological droughts (Rivera and Penalba, 2018). In North America, depending on the methods, datasets and study periods, there are differences between studies that suggest an increase (Shukla et al., 2015; Udall and Overpeck, 2017) versus a decrease in hydrological drought frequency (Mo and Lettenmaier, 2018), but in general there is strong spatial variability (Poshtiri and Pal, 2016). Streamflow observation reference networks of near-natural catchments have also been used to isolate the effect of climate trends on hydrological drought trends in a few regions, but these show limited trends in Northern Europe and Western and Central Europe (Stahl et al., 2010; Bard et al., 2015; Harrigan et al., 2018), North America (Dudley et al., 2020) and most of Australia, with the exception of Eastern and Southern Australia (X.S. Zhang et al., 2016). Given the low availability of observations, there are few studies analysing trends of drought severity in the groundwater. Nevertheless, some studies suggest a noticeable response of groundwater droughts to climate variability (Lorenzo-Lacruz et al., 2017) and increased drought frequency and severity associated with warming, probably as a consequence of enhanced ET induced by higher AED (Maxwell and Condon, 2016). This is supported by studies in Northern Europe (Bloomfield et al., 2019) and North America (Condon et al., 2020).
