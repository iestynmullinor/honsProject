This Chapter assesses changes in meteorological drought, agricultural and ecological droughts, and hydrological droughts. Precipitation-based indices are used for the estimation of changes in meteorological droughts, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the number of consecutive dry days (CDD). Changes in total soil moisture and soil moisture-based drought events are used for the estimation of changes in agricultural and ecological droughts, complemented by changes in surface soil moisture, water-balance estimates (precipitation minus ET), and SPEI-PM and PDSI-PM. For hydrological droughts, changes in low flows are assessed, sometimes complemented by changes in mean streamflow.In summary, different drought types exist and they are associated with different impacts and respond differently to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. Precipitation deficits and changes in evapotranspiration govern net water availability. A lack of sufficient soil moisture, sometimes amplified by increased atmospheric evaporative demand, result in agricultural and ecological drought. Lack of runoff and surface water result in hydrological drought. Drought events are the result of dynamic and/or thermodynamic processes, with thermodynamic processes being the main driver of drought changes under human-induced climate change (high confidence).
