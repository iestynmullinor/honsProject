Streamflow and groundwater are not directly simulated by ESMs, which only simulate runoff, but they are generally represented in hydrological models (Prudhomme et al., 2014; Giuntoli et al., 2015), which are typically driven in a stand-alone manner by observed or simulated climate forcing. The simulation of hydrological deficits is much more problematic than the simulation of mean streamflow or peak flows (Fundel et al., 2013; Stoelzle et al., 2013; Velázquez et al., 2013; Staudinger et al., 2015), since models tend to be too responsive to the climate forcing and do not satisfactorily capture low flows (Tallaksen and Stahl, 2014). Simulations of hydrological drought metrics show uncertainties related to the contribution of both GCMs and hydrological models (Bosshard et al., 2013; Giuntoli et al., 2015; Samaniego et al., 2017; Vetter et al., 2017), but hydrological models forced by the same climate input data also show a large spread (van Huijgevoort et al., 2013; Ukkola et al., 2018). At the catchment scale, the hydrological model uncertainty is higher than both GCM and downscaling uncertainty (Vidal et al., 2016), and the hydrological models show issues in representing drought propagation throughout the hydrological cycle (Barella-Ortiz and Quintana Seguí, 2019). A study on the evaluation of streamflow droughts in seven global (hydrological and land surface) models compared with observations in near-natural catchments of Europe showed a substantial spread among models, an overestimation of the number of drought events, and an underestimation of drought duration and drought-affected area (Tallaksen and Stahl, 2014).
