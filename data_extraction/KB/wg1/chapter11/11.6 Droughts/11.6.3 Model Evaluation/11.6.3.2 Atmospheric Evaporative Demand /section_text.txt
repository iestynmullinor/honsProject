There is onlylimited evidence on the evaluation of AED in state-of-the-art ESMs, which is performed on externally computed AED, based on model output (Scheff and Frierson, 2015; Liu and Sun, 2016, 2017). An evaluation of average AED in 17 CMIP5 ESMs for 1981–1999 based on potential evaporation show that the models’ spatial patterns resemble the observations, but the magnitude of potential evaporation displays strong divergence among models globally and regionally (Scheff and Frierson, 2015). The evaluation of AED in 12 CMIP5 ESMs with pan evaporation observations in East Asia for 1961–2000 (Liu and Sun, 2016, 2017) show that the ESMs capture seasonal cycles well, but that regional AED averages are underestimated due to biases in the meteorological variables controlling the aerodynamic and radiative components of AED. The CMIP5 ESMs also show a strong underestimation of atmospheric drying trends compared to reanalysis data (Douville and Plazzotta, 2017).
