Building on the SREX report and AR5, this Report defines an extreme weather event as ‘an event that is rare at a particular place and time of year’, and an extreme climate event as ‘a pattern of extreme weather that persists for some time, such as a season’ (see Glossary). The definitions of ‘rare’ are wide ranging, depending on applications. Some studies consider an event as an extreme if it is unprecedented; other studies consider events that occur several times a year as moderate extreme events. Rarity of an event with a fixed magnitude also changes under human-induced climate change, making events that are unprecedented so far rather probable under present conditions, but unique in the observational record – and thus often considered as ‘surprises’ (see Box 11.2).Various approaches are used to define extremes. These are generally based on the determination of relative (e.g., 90th percentile) or absolute (e.g., 35°C for a hot day) thresholds above which conditions are considered extremes. Changes in extremes can be examined from two perspectives, either focusing on changes in frequency of given extremes, or on changes in their intensity. These considerations in the definition of extremes are further addressed in Section 11.2.1.
