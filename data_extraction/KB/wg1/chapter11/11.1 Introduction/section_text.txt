The SREX (Chapter 3) assigned low confidence to changes in low-likelihood, high-impact (LLHI) events (termed ‘low-probability high-impact scenarios‘). Such events are often not anticipated and thus sometimes referred to as ‘surprises’. There are several types of LLHI events. Abrupt changes in mean climate are addressed in Chapter 4. Unanticipated LLHI events can either result from tipping points in the climate system (Section 1.4.4.3), such as the shutdown of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (SROCC Chapter 6; Collins et al., 2019) or the drydown of the Amazonian rainforest (SR1.5 Chapter 3, Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Drijfhout et al., 2015), or from uncertainties in climate processes, including climate feedbacks, that may enhance or damp extremes either related to global or regional climate responses (Seneviratne et al., 2018a; Sutton, 2018). The low confidence does not by itself exclude the possibility of such events occuring, rather it indicates a poor state of knowledge. Such outcomes, while improbable, could be associated with very high impacts, and are thus highly relevant from a risk perspective (see Section 1.4.3 and Box 11.4; Sutton, 2018, 2019). Alternatively, high impacts can occur when different extremes occur at the same time, or in short succession at the same location, or in several regions with shared vulnerability (e.g., food-basket regions Gaupp et al., 2019). These ‘compound events’ are assessed in Section 11.8, and Box 11.4 provides a case study example.Difficulties persist in determining the likelihood of occurrence and time frame of potential tipping points and LLHI events. However, new literature has emerged on unanticipated and LLHI events. There are some events that are sufficiently rare that they have not been observed in meteorological records, but whose occurrence is nonetheless plausible within the current state of the climate system – see examples below and in McCollum et al. (2020). The rare nature of such events and the limited availability of relevant data makes it difficult to estimate their occurrence probability and thus gives little evidence on whether to include such hypothetical events in planning decisions and risk assessments. The estimation of such potential surprises is often limited to events that have historical analogues (including before the instrumental records began, Wetter et al., 2014), albeit the magnitude of the event may differ. Additionally, there is also a limitation of available resources to exhaust all plausible trajectories of the climate system. As a result, there will still be events that cannot be anticipated. These events can be surprises to many in that the events have not been experienced, although their occurrence could be inferred by statistical means or physical modelling approaches (Chen et al., 2017; van Oldenborgh et al., 2017; Harrington and Otto, 2018a). Another approach focusing on the estimation of low-probability events and of events whose likelihood of occurrence is unknown consists in using physical climate models to create a physically self-consistent storyline of plausible extreme events and assessing their impacts and driving factors in past (Section 11.2.3) or future conditions (Section 11.2.4) (Hazeleger et al. , 2015; Shepherd, 2016; Zappa and Shepherd, 2017; Cheng et al. , 2018; Shepherd et al. , 2018; Sutton, 2018; Schaller et al. , 2020; Wehrli et al., 2020).In many parts of the world, observational data are limited to 50–60 years. This means that the chance to observe an extreme event at a particular location that occurs once in several hundred or more years is small. Thus, when a very extreme event occurs, it becomes a surprise to many (Bao et al., 2017; McCollum et al., 2020), and very rare events are often associated with high impacts(van Oldenborghet al. , 2017; Philipet al. , 2018b; Tozeret al. , 2020). Attributing and projecting very rare events in a particular location by assessing their likelihood of occurrence within the same larger region and climate thus provides another way to make quantitative assessments regarding events that are extremely rare locally. Some examples of such events include:Hurricane Harvey, that made landfall in Houston, TX in August 2017 (Section 11.7.1.4.)The 2010–2011 extreme floods in Queensland, Australia (Christidis et al., 2013a)The 2018 concurrent heatwaves across the Northern Hemisphere (Box 11.4)Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique (Cross-Chapter Box: Disaster in WGII AR6 Chapter 4)The California fires in 2018 and 2019The 2019–2020 Australia fires (Cross-Chapter Box: Disaster in WGII AR6 Chapter 4)One factor making such events hard to anticipate is the fact that we now live in a non-stationary climate, and that the framework of reference for adaptation is continuously moving. As an example, the concurrent heatwaves that occurred across the Northern Hemisphere in the summer of 2018 were considered very unusual and were unprecedented given the total area that was concurrently affected(Drouardet al. , 2019; Kornhuberet al. , 2019; Toretiet al. , 2019; Vogelet al. , 2019); however, the probability of this event under 1°C global warming was found to be about 16% (Vogel et al., 2019), which is not particularly low. Similarly, the 2013 summer temperature over eastern China was the hottest on record at the time, but it had an estimated recurrence interval of about four years in the climate of 2013 (Sun et al., 2014). Furthermore, when other aspects of the risk, vulnerability, and exposure are historically high or have recently increased (see WGII, Chapter 16, Section 16.4), relatively moderate extremes can have very high impacts (Otto et al., 2015b; Philip et al., 2018b). As warming continues, the climate moves further away from its historical state we are familiar with, resulting in an increased likelihood of unprecedented events and surprises. This is particularly the case under high global warming levels – for example, the climate of the late 21st century under high-emissions scenarios, above 4°C of global warming (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1).Another factor highlighted in Section 11.8 and Box 11.4 making events high-impact and difficult to anticipate is that several locations under moderate warming levels could be affected simultaneously, or very repeatedly by different types of extremes (Mora et al., 2018; Gaupp et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 2019). Box 11.4 shows that concurrent events at different locations, which can lead to major impacts across the world, can also result from the combination of anomalous circulation or natural variability (e.g., El Niño–Southern Oscillation) patterns with amplification of resulting responses to human-induced global warming. Also multivariate extremes at single locations pose specific challenges to anticipation (Section 11.8), with low likelihoods in the current climate but the probability of occurrence of such compound events strongly increasing with increasing global warming levels (Vogel et al., 2020a). Therefore, in order to estimate whether, and at what level of global warming, very high impacts arising from extremes would occur, the spatial extent of extremes and the potential of compounding extremes need to be assessed. Sections 11.3, 11.4, 11.7 and 11.8 highlight increasing evidence that temperature extremes, higher intensity precipitation accompanying tropical cyclones, and compound events such as dry/hot conditions conducive to wildfire or storm surges resulting from sea level rise and heavy precipitation events, pose widespread threats to societies already at relatively low warming levels. Studies have already shown that the probability for some recent extreme events is so small in the undisturbed world that these events were extremely unlikely  to occur without human influence (Section 11.2.4). Box 11.2, Table 1, provides examples of projected changes in LLHI extremes (single extremes, compound events) of potential relevance for impact and adaptation assessments showing that today’s very rare events can become commonplace in a warmer future.Box 11.2, Table 1 | Examples of changes in low-likelihood, high-impact extreme conditions (single extremes, compound events) at different global warming levels. +1°C (Present-day)+1.5°C+2°C+3°C and HigherRisk ratio for annual hottest daytime temperature (TXx) with 1% of probability under present-day warming (+1°C) (Kharin et al., 2018): Global land13.3 (i.e., 230% higher probability)8.2 (i.e., 720% higher probability)Not assessedRisk ratio for heavy precipitation events (Rx1day) with 1% of probability under present-day warming (+1°C) (Kharin et al., 2018): Global land11.2 (i.e., 20% higher probability)1.5 (i.e., 50% higher probability)Not assessedNumber of 1–5 day duration extreme floods with 1% of probability under present-day warming (+1°C) (H.

Compound events, including concurrent extremes, are a factor increasing the probability of LLHI events (high confidence). With increasing global warming, some compound events with low likelihood in past and current climate will become more frequent, and there is a higher chance of historically unprecedented events and surprises (high confidence). However, even extreme events that do not have a particularly low probability in the present climate (at more than 1°C of global warming) can be perceived as surprises because of the pace of global warming (high confidence).
