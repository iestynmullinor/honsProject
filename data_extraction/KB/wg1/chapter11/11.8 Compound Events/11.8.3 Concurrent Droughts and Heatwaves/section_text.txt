Concurrent droughts and heatwaves have a number of negative impacts on human society and natural ecosystems. Studies since SREX and AR5 show several occurrences of observed combinations of drought and heatwaves in various regions.Over most land regions, temperature and precipitation are strongly negatively correlated during summer (Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017), mostly due to land–atmosphere feedbacks (Sections 11.1.6 and 11.3.2), but also because synoptic-scale weather systems favourable for extreme heat are also unfavourable for rain (Berg et al., 2015). This leads to a strong correlation between droughts and heatwaves (Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017). Drought events characterized by low precipitation and extreme high temperatures have occurred, for example, in California (AghaKouchak et al., 2014), inland Eastern Australia (King et al., 2014), and large parts of Europe (Orth et al., 2016a). The 2018 growing season was both record-breaking dry and hot in Germany (Zscheischler and Fischer, 2020).The probability of co-occurring meteorological droughts and heatwaves has increased in the observational period in many regions and will continue to do so under unabated warming (Herrera-Estrada and Sheffield, 2017; Zscheischler and Seneviratne, 2017; Hao et al., 2018; Sarhadi et al., 2018; Alizadeh et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021). Overall, projections of increases in co-occurring drought and heatwaves are reported in northern Eurasia (Schubert et al., 2014), Europe (Orth et al., 2016a; Sedlmeier et al., 2018), south-east Australia (Kirono et al., 2017), multiple regions of the USA (Diffenbaugh et al., 2015; Herrera-Estrada and Sheffield, 2017), north-west China (X. Li et al., 2019; Kong et al., 2020) and India (Sharma and Mujumdar, 2017). The dominant signal is related to the increase in heatwave occurrence, which has been attributed to anthropogenic forcing (Section 11.3.4). This means that, even if drought occurrence is unaffected, compound hot and dry events will be more frequent (Sarhadi et al., 2018; Yu and Zhai, 2020).Drought and heatwaves are also associated with fire weather, related through high temperatures, low soil moisture, and low humidity. Fire weather refers to weather conditions conducive to triggering and sustaining wildfires, which generally include temperature, soil moisture, humidity, and wind (Chapter 12). Concurrent hot and dry conditions amplify conditions that promote wildfires (Schubert et al., 2014; Littell et al., 2016; Dowdy, 2018; Hope et al., 2019). Burnt area extent in western USA forests (Abatzoglou and Williams, 2016) and particularly in California (Williams et al., 2019) has been linked to anthropogenic climate change via a significant increase in vapour pressure deficit, a primary driver of wildfires. A study of the western USA examined the correlation between historical water-balance deficits and annual area burned, across a range of vegetation types, from temperate rainforest to desert (McKenzie and Littell, 2017). The relationship between temperature and dryness, and wildfire, varied with ecosystem type, and the fire–climate relationship was nonstationary and vegetation-dependent. In many fire-prone regions, such as the Mediterranean and China’s Daxing’anling region, projections for increased severity of future drought and heatwaves may lead to an increased frequency of wildfires relative to observed climatology (Tian et al., 2017; Ruffault et al., 2018). Observations show a long-term trend towards more dangerous weather conditions for bushfires in many regions of Australia, which is attributable (at least in part) to anthropogenic climate change (Dowdy, 2018). There is emerging evidence that recent regional surges in wildland fires are being driven by changing weather extremes (Cross-Chapter Box 3; Jia et al., 2019; SRCCL Chapter 2). Between 1979 and 2013, the global burnable area affected by long fire weather seasons doubled, and the mean length of the fire weather season increased by 19% (Jolly et al., 2015). However, at the global scale, the total burned area has been decreasing between 1998 and 2015 due to human activities mostly related to changes in land use (Andela et al., 2017). Given the projected  high confidence increase in compound hot and dry conditions, there is  high confidence that fire weather conditions will become more frequent at higher levels of global warming in some regions. This assessment is also consistent with Chapter 12’s examination of regional projected changes in fire weather. The SRCCL (Chapter 2) assessed with  high confidence that future climate variability is expected to enhance the risk and severity of wildfires in many biomes such as tropical rainforests.In summary, there is  high confidence that concurrent heatwaves and droughts have increased in frequency over the last century at the global scale due to human influence. There is medium confidence that weather conditions that promote wildfires (fire weather) have become more probable in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, the USA, and Australia over the last century. There is  high confidence that compound hot and dry conditions become more probable in nearly all land regions as global mean temperature increases. There is  high confidence that fire weather conditions will become more frequent at higher levels of global warming in some regions.
