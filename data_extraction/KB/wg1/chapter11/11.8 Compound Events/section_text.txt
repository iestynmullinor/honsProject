Occurrence of concurrent or near-concurrent extremes in different parts of a region, or in different locations around the world, challenges adaptation and risk management capacity. This can occur as a result of natural climate variability, as climates in different parts of the world are interconnected through large-scale atmospheric–oceanic teleconnections. In addition, in a warming climate, the probability of having several locations being affected simultaneously by, for example, hot extremes and heatwaves increases strongly as a function of global warming, with detectable changes even for changes as small as +0.5°C of additional global warming (Sections 11.2.4 and 11.3, Cross-chapter Box 11.1). Recent articles have highlighted the risks associated with concurrent extremes over large spatial scales (e.g., Lehner and Stocker, 2015; Boers et al., 2019; Gaupp et al., 2019). There is evidence that such global-scale extremes associated with hot temperature extremes are increasing in occurrence (Sippel et al., 2015; Vogel et al., 2019). Hereafter, the focus is on two case studies of recent global-scale events that featured concurrent extremes in several regions across the world. The first focuses on concurrent extremes driven by variability in tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) associated with the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño, while the second addresses the impacts of global warming combined with abnormal atmospheric circulation patterns in the 2018 boreal spring/summer.Box 11.4, Figure 1 |  | Analysis of the percentage of land area affected by temperature extremes larger than two (blue) or three (orange) standard deviations in June–July–August (JJA) between 30°N and 80°N using a normalization. This figure shows a substantial increase in the overall land area affected by very strong hot extremes since 1990. Adapted from Sippel et al. (2015).Open figureThe extreme El Niño in 2015–2016El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the phenomena that have the ability to bring multitudes of extremes in different parts of the world, especially in extreme El Niño (Annex IV.2.3) cases. Additionally, the background climate warming associated with greenhouse gas forcing can significantly exacerbate extremes in parts of the world, even under normal El Niño conditions. The 2015–2016 extreme El Niño event was one of the three extreme El Niño events since the 1980s and the availability of satellite rainfall observations. According to some measures, it was the strongest El Niño in the past 145 years (Barnard et al., 2017). The 2015–2016 warmth was unprecedented at the central equatorial Pacific (Niño4: 5°N–5°S, 150°E–150°W), and this exceptional warmth was unlikely  to have occurred entirely naturally, appearing to reflect an anthropogenically forced trend (Newman et al., 2018). In particular, its signal was seen in very high monthly global mean surface temperature (GMST) values in late 2015 and early 2016, contributing to the highest record of GMST in 2016 (Section 2.3.1.1). Both the ENSO amplitude and the frequency of high-magnitude events since 1950 is higher than over the pre-industrial period (medium confidence) (Section 2.4.2), suggesting that global extremes similar to those associated with the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño would occur more frequently under further increases in global warming. A brief summary of extreme events that happened in 2015–2016 is provided in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.5.1.1 of the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC). We provide some highlights illustrating extremes that occurred in different parts of the world during the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño in Box 11.4, Table 1, as well as in the short summary that follows.Box 11.4, Table 1 | List of events related to the 2015–2016 Extreme El Niño in the literature.

(2017b)Global2015–2016 El NiñoHigh CO2 release to the atmosphere associated with droughts and fires in several affected regionsHumphrey et al. (2018); Brando et al. (2019)Several regions were strongly affected by droughts in 2015, including Indonesia, Australia, the Amazon region, Ethiopia, southern Africa, and Europe. As a result, global measurements of land water anomalies were particularly low in that year (Humphrey et al., 2018). In 2015, Indonesia experienced a severe drought and forest fire, causing pronounced impact on economy, ecology and human health due to haze crisis(Fieldet al. , 2016; Huijnenet al. , 2016; Patraet al. , 2017; Hartmannet al. , 2018).  The northern part of Australia experienced high temperatures and low precipitation between late 2015 and early 2016, and the extensive mangrove trees were damaged along the Gulf of Carpentaria in Northern Australia (Duke et al., 2017). The Amazon region experienced the most intense droughts of this century in 2015–2016. This drought was more severe than the previous major droughts that occurred in the Amazon in 2005 and 2010 (Lewis et al., 2011; Erfanian et al., 2017; Panisset et al., 2018). The 2015–2016 Amazon drought impacted the entirety of South America north of 20°S during the austral spring and summer (Erfanian et al., 2017). It also increased forest fire incidence by 36% compared to the preceding 12 years (Aragão et al., 2018) and, as a consequence, increased the biomass burning outbreaks and the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration in the area, affecting air quality (Ribeiro et al., 2018). This out-of-season drought affected the water availability for human consumption and agricultural irrigation. It also left rivers with very low water levels and large sandbanks, preventing ship transportation of food, medicines, and fuels (INMET, 2017). Eastern African countries were impacted by drought in 2015. The drought in Ethiopia was the worst in several decades and was associated with the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño (Blunden and Arndt, 2016; Philip et al., 2018b). It was suggested that anthropogenic warming contributed to the 2015 Ethiopian and southern African droughts by increasing SSTs and local air temperatures (Funk et al., 2016, 2018b; Yuan et al., 2018a). It has also been suggested that the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño affected circulation patterns in Europe during the 2015–2016 winter (Geng et al., 2017; Scaife et al., 2017).The atmospheric CO2 growth rate was particularly high in 2015, possibly related to some of the mentioned droughts, in particular in Indonesia and the Amazon region, leading to higher CO2 release in combination with less CO2 uptake from land areas (Humphrey et al., 2018). The impact of the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño on vegetation systems via drought was also shown from satellite data (Kogan and Guo, 2017). Overall, tropical forests were a carbon source to the atmosphere during the 2015–2016 El Niño-related drought, with some estimates suggesting that up to 2.3 PgC were released (Brando et al., 2019).The 2015–2016 extreme El Niño has induced extreme precipitation in some regions. Severe rainfall events were observed in Chennai city in India in Devember 2015, and the Yangtze river region in China in June–July 2016, and it was shown that these rainfall events are partly attributed to the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño(van Oldenborghet al. , 2016; Boyajet al. , 2018; Sun and Miao, 2018; Yuanet al. , 2018b; Zhouet al., 2018). In 2015, tropical cyclone activity was notably high in the North Pacific (Blunden and Arndt, 2016). Over the western North Pacific, there were 13 Category 4 and 5 tropical cyclones (TCs), more than twice the area’s typical annual value of 6.3 (W. Zhang et al., 2016b). Similarly, a record-breaking number of TCs were observed in the eastern North Pacific, particularly in the western part of that domain (Collins et al., 2016; Murakami et al., 2017b). These extraordinary TC activities were related to the average SST anomaly during that year, which were associated with the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño and the positive phase of the Pacific Meridional Mode (Murakami et al., 2017b; Hong et al., 2018; Yamada et al., 2019). However, it has been suggested that the intense TC activities in both the western and the eastern North Pacific in 2015 were not only due to the El Niño, but also to a contribution of anthropogenic forcing (Murakami et al., 2017b; S.-H. Yang et al., 2018). The impact of the Indian Ocean SST was also suggested to contribute to the extreme TC activity in the western North Pacific in 2015 (Zhan et al., 2018). In contrast, in Australia, it was the least active TC season since satellite records began in 1969–1970 (Blunden and Arndt, 2017).Global-scale temperature extremes and concurrent precipitation extremes in boreal 2018 spring and summerIn the 2018 boreal spring–summer season (May–August), wide areas of the mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere experienced heat extremes and (in part) enhanced drought(Box 11.4, Figure 2; Kornhuberet al. , 2019; Vogelet al. , 2019). The reported impacts included(Vogel et al., 2019): 90 deaths from heat strokes in Quebec (Canada); 1469 deaths from heat strokes in Japan (Shimpo et al., 2019); 48 heat-related deaths in the Republic of Korea (Min et al., 2020); heat warnings affecting 90,000 students in the USA; fires in numerous countries (Canada (British Columbia), USA (California), Finland (Lapland), Latvia); crop losses in the UK, Germany and Switzerland (Vogel et al., 2019) and overall in central and Northern Europe (leading to yield reductions of up to 50% for the main crops (Toreti et al., 2019); fish deaths in Switzerland; and melting of roads in the Netherlands and the UK, among others. In addition to the numerous hot and dry extremes, an extremely heavy rainfall event occurred over wide areas of Japan from 28 June to 8 July 2018 (Tsuguti et al., 2018), which was followed by a heatwave (Shimpo et al., 2019). The heavy precipitation event caused more than 230 deaths in Japan, and was named ‘the Heavy Rain Event of July 2018’.The heavy precipitation event was characterized by unusually widespread and persistent rainfall and locally anomalous total precipitation led by band-shaped precipitation systems, which are frequently associated with heavy precipitation events in East Asia (Section 11.7.3; Kato, 2020). The extreme rainfall in Japan was caused by anomalous moisture transport with a combination of abnormal jet condition (Takemi and Unuma, 2019; Takemura et al., 2019; Tsuji et al., 2020; Yokoyama et al., 2020), which can be viewed as an atmospheric river (Sections 8.2.2.8 and 11.7.2; Yatagai et al., 2019) caused by intensified inflow velocity and high SST around Japan (Sekizawa et al., 2019; Kawase et al., 2020).This precipitation event and the subsequent heatwave are related to abnormal condition of the jet stream and North Pacific Subtropical High in this month (Shimpo et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2020), which caused extreme conditions from Europe, Eurasia, and North America (Box 11.4, Figure 2; Kornhuber et al., 2019). A combination of the positive anomaly of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO, Annex IV.2.1) and the meandering jets is necessary to explain the pattern of the observed anomalies (Drouard et al. , 2019). A role of Atlantic SST anomaly on the meandering jets and the subtropical high have been suggested (B. Liu et al., 2019). These dynamic and thermodynamic components generally have substantial influence on extreme rainfall in East Asia (Oh et al., 2018), but it is under investigation whether these factors were due to anthropogenic forcing.Regarding the hot extremes that occurred across the Northern Hemisphere in the 2018 boreal May–July period, Vogel et al. (2019) found that the event was unprecedented in terms of the total area affected by hot extremes (on average, about 22% of populated and agricultural areas in the Northern Hemisphere) for that period, but was consistent with a +1°C climate which was the estimated global mean temperature anomaly around that time (for 2017; SR1.5). This study also found that events similar to the 2018 May–July temperature extremes would approximately occur two out of three years under +1.5°C of global warming, and every year under +2°C of global warming. Imada et al. (2019) also suggest that the mean annual occurrence of extreme hot days in Japan will be expected to increase by 1.8 times under a global warming level of 2°C above pre-industrial levels. Kawase et al. (2020) showed that the extreme rainfall in Japan during this event was increased by approximately 7% due to recent rapid warming around Japan. Imada et al.  (2020)  showed that the probability of the Heavy Rain Event of July 2018 in Japan was increased from 0.22% to 2.00% due to anthropogenic warming. Hence, it is virtually certain that these 2018 concurrent events would not have occurred without human-induced global warming. Concurrent events of this type are also projected to happen more frequently under higher levels of global warming. However, there is currentlylow confidence in projected changes in the frequency or strength of the anomalous circulation patterns leading to concurrent extremes (e.g., Cross-Chapter Box 10.1).Box 11.4, Figure 2 | Meteorological conditions in July 2018.  The colour shading shows the monthly mean near-surface air temperature anomaly with respect to 1981–2010. Contour lines indicate the geopotential height in m, highlighted are the isolines on 12,000 m and 12,300 m, which indicate the approximate positions of the polar-front jet and subtropical jet, respectively. The light blue-green ellipse shows the approximate extent of the strong precipitation event that occurred at the beginning of July in the region of Japan and Korea. All data is from the global European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5, Hersbach et al., 2020).Open figureThe case studies presented in this Box illustrate the current state of knowledge regarding the contribution of human-induced climate change to recent concurrent extremes in the global domain. Recent years have seen a more frequent occurrence of such events. The heatwave in Europe in the 2019 boreal summer and its coverage in the global domain is an additional example (Vautard et al., 2020). However, very few studies investigate which types of concurrent extreme events could occur under increasing global warming. It has been noted that such events could also be of particular risk for concurrent impacts in the world’s breadbaskets (Zampieri et al., 2017; Kornhuber et al., 2020; see also Section 11.8.1).In summary, the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño and the 2018 boreal spring/summer extremes were two examples of recent concurrent extremes. The El Niño event in 2015–2016 was one of the three extreme El Niño events since the 1980s, and there are many extreme events concurrently observed in this period including droughts, heavy precipitation, and more frequent intense tropical cyclones. Both the ENSO amplitude and the frequency of high-magnitude events since 1950 is higher than over the pre-industrial period (medium confidence), suggesting that global extremes similar to those associated with the 2015–2016 extreme El Niño would occur more frequently under further increases in global warming. The 2018 boreal spring/summer extremes were characterized by heat extremes and enhanced droughts in wide areas of the mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and extremely heavy rainfall in East Asia. These concurrent events were generally related to the abnormal condition of the jet and North Pacific Subtropical High, but also amplified by background global warming. It is virtually certain that these 2018 concurrent extreme events would not have occurred without human-induced global warming. Recent years have seen a more frequent occurrence of such concurrent events. However, it is still unknown which types of concurrent extreme events could occur under increasing global warming.
