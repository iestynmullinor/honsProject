There is  high confidence that coarse-resolution climate models (e.g., CMIP5 and CMIP6) underestimate the dynamical intensity of ETCs, including the strongest ETCs, as measured using a variety of metrics, including mean pressure gradient, mean vorticity and near-surface wind speeds, over most regions (Colle et al., 2013; Zappa et al., 2013a; Govekar et al., 2014; Di Luca et al., 2016; Trzeciak et al., 2016; Seiler et al., 2018; Priestley et al., 2020). There is also  high confidence that most current climate models underestimate the number of explosive systems (i.e., systems showing a decrease in mean sea level pressure of at least 24 hPa in 24 hours) over both hemispheres (Seiler and Zwiers, 2016a; Gao et al., 2020;Priestley et al., 2020). There is  high confidence that the underestimation of the intensity of ETCs is associated with the coarse horizontal resolution of climate models, with higher horizontal resolution models, including HighResMIP and CORDEX, usually showing better performance (Colle et al., 2013; Zappa et al., 2013a; Di Luca et al., 2016; Trzeciak et al., 2016; Seiler et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2020; Priestley et al., 2020). The improvement by higher-resolution models is found, even when comparing models and reanalyses after post-processing data to a common resolution (Zappa et al., 2013a; Di Luca et al., 2016; Priestley et al., 2020). The systematic bias in the intensity of ETCs has also been linked to the inability of current climate models to resolve diabatic processes, particularly those related to the release of latent heat (Willison et al., 2013; Trzeciak et al., 2016) and the formation of clouds (Govekar et al., 2014). There is medium confidence that climate models simulate well the spatial distribution of precipitation associated with ETCs over the Northern Hemisphere, together with some of the main features of the ETC life cycle, including the maximum in precipitation occurring just before the peak in dynamical intensity (e.g., vorticity) as observed in a reanalysis and observations (Hawcroft et al., 2018). There is, however, large observational uncertainty in ETC-associated precipitation (Hawcroft et al., 2018) and limitations in the simulation of frontal precipitation, including overly low rainfall intensity over mid-latitude oceanic areas in both hemispheres (Catto et al., 2015).
