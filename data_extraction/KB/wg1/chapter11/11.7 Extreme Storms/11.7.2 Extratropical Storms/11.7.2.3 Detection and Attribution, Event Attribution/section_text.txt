(Section 3.3.3.3 concluded that there is low confidence in the attribution of observed changes in the number of ETCs in the Northern Hemisphere and  high confidence that the poleward shift of storm tracks in the Southern Hemisphere is linked to human activity, mostly due to emissions of ozone-depleting substances. Specific studies attributing changes in the most extreme ETCs are not available. The human influence on individual extreme ETC events has been considered only a few times and there is overall low confidence in the attribution of these changes (NASEM, 2016; Vautard et al., 2019).
