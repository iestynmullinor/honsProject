Tables 11.5, 11.8, 11.11, 11.14, 11.17, and 11.20 include assessments for past changes in heavy precipitation events and their attribution, as well as future projections. The evidence is mostly drawn from changes in metrics based on one-day or five-day precipitation amounts, as addressed in Section 11.4. Similar to temperature extremes, the assessment of changes in heavy precipitation uses global studies, including Dunn et al. (2020) and Sun et al. (2021) for observed changes, and Li et al. (2021) and the Chapter 11 Supplementary Material (11.SM) for projected changes using the CMIP6 multi-model ensemble. For attribution, Paik et al. (2020) provided continental analyses where data coverage was sufficient, but no attribution studies based on global data are available for the regional scale. For each region, regional studies, and studies based on the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble or CORDEX simulations, are also considered in the assessments for past changes, attribution, and projections.
