The probability of compound events has likely  increased in the past due to human-induced climate change and will likely  continue to increase with further global warming. Concurrent heatwaves and droughts have become more frequent, and this trend will continue with higher global warming (high confidence). Fire weather conditions (compound hot, dry and windy events) have become more probable in some regions (medium confidence) and there is  high confidence that they will become more frequent in some regions at higher levels of global warming. The probability of compound flooding (storm surge, extreme rainfall and/or river flow) has increased in some locations (medium confidence), and will continue to increase due to sea level rise and increases in heavy precipitation, including changes in precipitation intensity associated with tropical cyclones (high confidence). The land area affected by concurrent extremes has increased (high confidence). Concurrent extreme events at different locations, but possibly affecting similar sectors (e.g., critical crop-producing areas for global food supply) in different regions, will become more frequent with increasing global warming, in particular above 2Â°C of global warming (high confidence). {11.8, Box 11.2, Box 11.4}.
