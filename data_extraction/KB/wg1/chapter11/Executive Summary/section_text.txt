The future occurrence of low-likelihood, high-impact events linked to climate extremes is generally associated with  low confidence, but cannot be excluded, especially at global warming levels above 4°C. Compound events, including concurrent extremes, are a factor increasing the probability of low-likelihood, high-impact events (high confidence). With increasing global warming, some compound events with low likelihood in past and current climates will become more frequent, and there is a higher chance of occurrence of historically unprecedented events and surprises (high confidence). However, even extreme events that do not have a particularly low probability in the present climate (at more than 1°C of global warming) can be perceived as surprises because of the pace of global warming (high confidence). {Box 11.2}
