Since AR5, the confidence about past and future changes in weather and climate extremes has increased due to better physical understanding of processes, an increasing proportion of the scientific literature combining different lines of evidence, and improved accessibility to different types of climate models (high confidence). There have been improvements in some observation-based datasets, including reanalysis data (high confidence). Climate models can reproduce the sign (direction) of changes in temperature extremes observed globally and in most regions, although the magnitude of the trends may differ (high confidence). Models are able to capture the large-scale spatial distribution of precipitation extremes over land (high confidence). The intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation simulated by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models are similar to those simulated by CMIP5 models (high confidence). Higher horizontal model resolution improves the spatial representation of some extreme events (e.g., heavy precipitation events), in particular in regions with highly varying topography (high confidence). {11.2, 11.3, 11.4}
