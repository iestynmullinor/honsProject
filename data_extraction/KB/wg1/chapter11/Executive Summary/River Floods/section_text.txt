Significant trends in peak streamflow have been observed in some regions over the past decades (high confidence). The seasonality of river floods has changed in cold regions where snow-melt is involved, with an earlier occurrence of peak streamflow (high confidence). {11.5}Global hydrological models project a larger fraction of land areas to be affected by an increase in river floods than by a decrease in river floods (medium confidence). Regional changes in river floods are more uncertain than changes in pluvial floods because complex hydrological processes and forcings, including land cover change and human water management, are involved. {11.5}
