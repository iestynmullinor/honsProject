Recently, quantifying global and regional climate at specific global warming levels (GWLs) has become widespread, motivated by the inclusion of explicit GWLs in the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement (Section 1.6.2). GWLs, expressed as changes in global surface temperature relative to the 1850–1900 period (see Cross-Chapter Box 2.3), are used in SR1.5 and in the assessment of Reasons for Concerns in the WGII reports (see also Cross-Chapter Box 12.1). Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Figure 1 illustrates how the assessment of the climate response at GWLs relates to the uncertainty in scenarios regarding the timing of the respective GWLs, as well as to the uncertainty in the associated regional climate responses, including extremes and other climatic impact-drivers (CIDs). For many (but not all) climate variables and CIDs, the response pattern for a given GWL is consistent across different scenarios (Chapters 1, 4, 9, 11 and Atlas). GWLs are defined as long-term means (e.g., 20-year averages) compared to the pre-industrial period, are commonly used in the literature, and were also underlying main assessments of SR1.5 (Chapter 3). Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Figure 1 | Schematic representation of relationship between emissions scenarios, global warming levels (GWLs), regional climate responses, and impacts.  The illustration shows the implied uncertainty problem associated with differentiating between 1.5°C, 2°C, and other GWLs. Focusing on GWLs raises questions associated with emissions pathways to get to these temperatures (scenarios), as well as regional climate responses and the associated impacts at the corresponding GWL (the impacts question).

The regional response patterns at given GWLs have been found to be consistent across different scenarios for many climate variables (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1 Figure 2; Pendergrasset al. , 2015; Seneviratneet al. , 2016; Wartenburgeret al. , 2017; Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). The consistency tends to be higher for temperature-related variables than for variables in the hydrological cycle or variables characterizing atmospheric dynamics, and for intermediate to high-emissions scenarios than for low-emissions scenarios (e.g., for mean precipitation in the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 scenario: Pendergrass et al., 2015; Wartenburger et al., 2017). Nonetheless, Cross-Chapter Box 11.1 Figure 2 illustrates that, even for mean precipitation, which is known to be forcing dependent (Sections 4.6.1 and 8.5.3), scenario differences in the response pattern at a given GWL are smaller than model uncertainty and internal variability in many regions (Herger et al., 2015). The response pattern is further found to be broadly consistent between models that reach a GWL relatively early, and those that reach it later under a given Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP; see Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Figure 2g,h). Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Figure 2 |  (a–c) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) multi-model mean precipitation change at 2°C global warming level (GWL) (20-year mean) in three different Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios relative to 1850–1900. All models reaching the corresponding GWL in the corresponding scenario are averaged. The number of models averaged across is shown at the top right of the panel. The maps for the other two SSP scenarios SSP1-1.9 (five models only) and SSP3-7.0 (not shown) are consistent.  (d–f)  Same as (a–c) but for annual mean temperature.  (g) Annual mean temperature change at 2°C in CMIP6 models with high warming rate reaching the GWL in the corresponding scenario before the earliest year of the assessed very likely range (Section 4.3.4).  (h) Climate response at 2°C GWL across all SSP1-1.9, SSP2-2.6, SSP2-4.5. SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5 in all other models not shown in (g). The close agreement of (g) and (h) demonstrates that the mean temperature response at 2°C is not sensitive to the rate of warming, and thereby the global mean surface air temperature (GSAT) warming of the respective models in 2081–2100. Uncertainty is represented using the advanced approach: No overlay indicates regions with robust signal, where ≥66% of models show change greater than the variability threshold and ≥80% of all models agree on the sign of change; diagonal lines indicate regions with no change or no robust signal, where <66% of models show a change greater than the variability threshold; crossed lines indicate regions with conflicting signal, where ≥66% of models show change greater than the variability threshold and <80% of all models agree on the sign of change. For more information on the advanced approach, please refer to the Cross-Chapter Box Atlas.1.Open figureIn contrast to linear pattern scaling (Mitchell, 2003; Collins et al., 2013), the use of GWLs as a dimension of integration does not require linearity in the response of a climate variable. It is therefore useful even for metrics that do not show a linear response, such as the frequency of heat extremes over land and oceans (Fischer and Knutti, 2015; Frölicher et al., 2018; Kharin et al., 2018; Perkins-Kirkpatrick and Gibson, 2017) if the relationship of the variable of interest to the GWL is scenario independent. The latter means that the response is independent of the pathway and relative contribution of various radiative forcings. For some more complex indices like warm-spell duration, or for regions with strong aerosol changes, discrepancies can be larger (Z. Wang et al., 2017b; King et al., 2018; Tebaldi et al., 2020). (See also the subsection below on GWLs vs scenarios for further caveats.)The limited scenario dependence of the GWL-based response for many variables implies that the regional response to emissions scenarios can be split in almost independent contributions of: (i) the transient global warming response to scenarios (see Chapter 4); and (ii) the regional response as function of a given GWL, which has also been referred to as ‘regional climate sensitivity’ (Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020). This property has also been used to develop regionally resolved emulators for global climate models, using global surface temperature as input (Beusch et al., 2020; Tebaldi et al., 2020). Analyses of the CMIP6 and CMIP5 multi-model ensembles shows that the GWL-based responses are very similar for temperature and precipitation extremes across the ensembles (Seneviratne and Hauser, 2020; Wehner, 2020; Li et al. , 2021). This is despite their difference in global warming response (Chapter 4), confirming a substantial decoupling between the two responses (global warming vs GWL-based regional response) for these variables. Thus, the GWL approach isolates the uncertainty in the regional climate response from the global warming uncertainty induced by scenario, global mean model response and internal variability (Cross-Chapter Box, Figure 1).Mapping between GWL- and scenario-based responses in model analysesTo map scenario-based climate projections into changes at specific GWLs, first, all individual Earth system model (ESM) simulations that reach a certain GWL are identified. Second, the climate response patterns at the respective GWL are calculated using an approach termed here ‘GWL-sampling’ – sometimes also referred to as epoch analysis, time shift, or time sampling approach – taking into account all models and scenarios (Cross-Chapter Box, Figure 3). Note that the range of years when a given GWL is reached in the CMIP6 ensemble is different from the AR6 assessed range of projected global surface temperature (Section 4.3.4; Table 4.5). The latter further takes into account different lines of evidence, including the assessed observed warming between pre-industrial and present day, information from observational constraints on CMIP6, and emulators using the assessed transient climate response (TCR) and equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) ranges (Section 4.3.4). Hence the Chapter 4 assessed range (Table 4.5) is the reference to determine when a given GWL is likely reached under given scenarios, while the mapping between scenarios/time frames and GWLs is used to assess the respective regional responses happening at these time frames (which also allows accounting for the global surface temperature assessment, rather than using scenarios analyses directly from CMIP6 output).In the model-based asssessment of Chapters 4, 8, 10, 11, 12 and the Atlas, the estimation of changes at GWLs are generally defined as the 20-year time period in which the mean global surface air temperature (GSAT; Cross-Chapter Box 2.3) first exceeds a certain anomaly relative to 1850–1900 – for simulations that start after 1850, relative to all years up to 1900 (Cross-Chapter Box Figure 3). The years when each individual model reaches a given GWL for CMIP6 and CMIP5 can be found in Hauser et al. (2021). The changes at given GWLs are identified for each ensemble member (for all scenarios) individually. Thereby, a given GWL is potentially reached a few years earlier or later in different realizations of the same model due to internal variability, but the temperature averaged across the 20-year period analysed in any simulation is consistent with the GWL. Instead of blending the information from the different scenarios, the Interactive Atlas can be used to compare the GWL spatial patterns and timings across the different scenarios (see Section (Atlas 1.3.1). Cross-Chapter Box11.1, Figure 3 | Illustration of the AR6 global warming level (GWL) sampling approach to derive the timing and the response at a given GWL for the case of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) data. For the mapping of scenarios/time slices into GWLs for CMIP6, please refer to Table 4.2. Respective numbers for the CMIP5 multi-model experiment are provided in Chapter 11 Supplementary Material (11.SM.1). Note that the time frames used to derive the GWL time slices can also include a different number of years (e.g., 30 years for some analyses).Open figureMapping between GWL- and scenario-based responsesfor literatureA large fraction of the literature considers scenario-based analyses for given time slices. When GWL-based information is required instead, an approximated mapping of the multi-model mean can be derived based on the known GWL in the given experiments for a particular time period. As a rough approximation, CMIP6 multi-model mean projections for the near-term (2021–2040) correspond to changes at about 1.5°C, and projections for the high-end scenario (SSP5-8.5) for the long-term (2081–2100) correspond to about 4°C–5°C of global warming(see Table 4.2 for changes in the CMIP6 ensemble and the Chapter 11 Supplementary Material (11.SM.1) and Hauser (2021) for details on other time periods and CMIP5). These approximated changes are used for some of the GWL-based assessments provided in the Chapter 11 regional tables (Section 11.9 and Table 11.3) when literature based on scenario projections is used to assess estimated changes at given GWLs.GWLs versus scenariosThe use of scenarios remains a key element to inform mitigation decisions (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4), to assess which emissions pathways are consistent with a certain GWL (Cross-Chapter Box 1.4, Figure 1), to estimate when certain GWLs are reached (Section 4.3.4), and to assess for which variables it is meaningful to use GWLs as a dimension of integration. The use of scenarios is also essential for variables whose climate response strongly depends on the contribution of radiative forcing (e.g., aerosols) or land-use and land management changes, are time and warming rate dependent (e.g., sea level rise), or differ between transient and quasi-equilibrium states. Furthermore, the use of concentration or emission-driven scenario simulations is required if regional climate assessments need to account for the uncertainty in GSAT changes or climate-carbon feedbacks.Forcing dependence of the GWL response is found for global mean precipitation (Section 8.4.3), but less for regional patterns of mean precipitation changes (Cross-Chapter Box 11.1, Figure 2). Limited dependence is found for extremes, as highlighted above. In the cryosphere, elements that are quick to respond to warming like sea ice area, permafrost and snow, show little scenario dependence (Sections 9.3.1.1, 9.5.2.3 and 9.5.3.3), whereas slow-responding variables such as ice volumes of glaciers and ice sheets respond with a substantial delay and, due to their inertia, the response depends on when a certain GWL is reached. This also applies to some extent for sea level rise where, for example, the contributions of melting glaciers and ice sheets depend on the pathway followed to reach a given GWL (Section 9.6.3.4).In addition to the lagged effect, the climate response at a given GWL may differ before and after a period of overshoot, for example in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (e.g., Palter et al. 2018). Finally, as assessed in IPCC SR1.5, there is a difference in the response even for temperature-related variables if a GWL is reached in a rapidly warming transient state or in an equilibrium state when the land–sea warming contrast is less pronounced (e.g., King et al. 2020). However, in this Report, GWLs are used in the context of projections for the 21st century when the climate response is mostly not in equilibrium and where projections for many variables are less dependent on the pathway than for projections beyond 2100 (Section 9.6.3.4).Key conclusions on assessment s based on GWLsGWL-based projections can inform society and policymakers on how climate would change under GWLs consistent with the aims of the Paris Agreement (stabilization at 1.5°C/well below 2°C), as well as on the consequences of missing these aims and reaching GWLs of 3°C or 4°C by the end of the century. The AR6 assessment shows that every bit of global warming matters and that changes in global warming of 0.5°C lead to statistically significant changes in mean climate and climate extremes on global scale and for large regions (Sections 4.6.2, 11.2.4, 11.3, 11.4, 11.6 and 11.9, Figures 11.8 and 11.9, Atlas and Interactive Atlas), as also assessed in IPCC SR1.5.
