Soil NOx (SNOx) emissions occur in connection with complex biogenic/microbial nitrification and denitrification processes (Ciais et al., 2013), which in turn are sensitive – in a non-linear manner – to temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, carbon and nutrient content, and the biome itself (e.g., Hudman et al., 2012). Global SNOx estimates, based on observationally constrained chemistry-transport model and vegetation model studies, show a broad range between 4.7–16.8 TgN yr–1 (Young et al., 2018). This estimate is generally larger than the current source strength used in CMIP6 simulations, which is prescribed using an early empirical estimate, typically scaled to about 5 TgN yr–1 (Yienger and Levy, 1995).By the end of the 21st century, the overall nitrogen fixation in non-agricultural ecosystems could be 40% larger than in 2000, due to increased enzyme activity with growing temperatures, but the emission rates of NO (and N2O) could be dominated by changes in precipitation patterns and evapotranspiration fluxes (Fowler et al., 2015). Current Earth system models (ESMs) incorporate biophysical and biogeochemical processes only to a limited extent (Jia et al., 2019), precluding adequate climate sensitivity studies for SNOx. Hence, while the current strength source of soil NOx has been better constrained over the last decade, adequate representations of SNOx and how it escapes from the canopy, which could provide quantitative estimates of climate-driven changes in SNOx, are still missing in ESMs.
