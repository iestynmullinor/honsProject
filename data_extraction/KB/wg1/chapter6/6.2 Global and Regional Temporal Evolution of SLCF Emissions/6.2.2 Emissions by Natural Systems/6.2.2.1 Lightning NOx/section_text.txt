Lightning contributes approximately 10% of the total NOx emissions (Murray, 2016). Since lightning NOx (LNOx) is predominantly released in the upper troposphere, it has a disproportionately large impact on ozone and OH, and on the lifetime of methanecompared with surface NOx emissions. Whereas the global spatial and temporal distribution of lightning flashes can be characterized thanks to satellite-borne and ground sensors (Virts et al., 2013; Cecil et al., 2014), constraining the amount of NOx produced per flash (Miyazaki et al. , 2014; Medici et al. , 2017; Nault  et al. , 2017; Marais et al. , 2018; D.J. Allen et al. , 2019; Bucsela et al. , 2019) and its vertical allocation (Koshak et al., 2014; Medici et al., 2017) has been more elusive. Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP) models in CMIP5 used a range of LNOx4 between 1.2–9.7 TgN y−1 (Lamarque et al., 2013b). In CMIP6, the corresponding LNOx range is between 3.2–7.6 TgN y−1 (Griffiths et al., 2021). All CMIP6 models (as well as most models included in CMIP5, Young et al., 2013) apply a parametrization that relates cloud-top height to lightning intensity (Price and Rind, 1992), projecting an increase in LNOx in a warmer world in the range of 0.27–0.61 TgN yr−1°C–1 (Thornhill et al., 2021a). However, models using parametrizations based on convection (Grewe et al., 2001), updraft mass flux (Allen and Pickering, 2002) or ice flux (Finney et al., 2016a) show either much less sensitivity or a negative response (Finney et al., 2016b, 2018; Clark et al., 2017).In summary, the total present-day global lightning NOx emissions are still estimated to be within a factor of two. There is  high confidence that LNOx are perturbed by climate change; however, there is low confidence in the sign of the change due to fundamental uncertainties in parametrizations.
