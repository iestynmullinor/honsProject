According to the SRCCL assessment (Jia et al., 2019), agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) are a significant net source of GHG emissions (high confidence), with more than half of these emissions attributed to non-CO2 gHGs from agriculture. With respect to SLCFs, agricultural activities are major global sources of methane and NH3 (Section 6.2.1). The agriculture sector exerts strong near-term warming due to large methane emissions that is slightly offset by a small cooling from secondary inorganic aerosols formed notably from the NH3 emissions (Heald and Geddes, 2016; Lund et al., 2020). For present-day emissions, agriculture is the second largest contributor to warming on short time scales but with a small persisting effect on surface temperature (+0.0012°C ± 0.00028°C) after a pulse of current emissions (Figure 6.16, see detailed description in Section 6.6.2.3.4; Lund et al., 2020). Aerosols produced from agricultural emissions, released after nitrogen fertilizer application and from animal husbandry, influence surface air quality and make an important contribution to surface PM2.5 in many densely populated areas ( Figure 6.17; Lelieveld et al., 2015b; Bauer et al., 2016).
