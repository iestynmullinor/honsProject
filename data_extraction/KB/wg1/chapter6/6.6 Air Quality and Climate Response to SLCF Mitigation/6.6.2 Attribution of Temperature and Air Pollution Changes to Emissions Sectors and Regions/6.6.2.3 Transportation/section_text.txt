The on-road and off-road transportation sectors have a net warming impact on climate over all time scales (Berntsen and Fuglestvedt, 2008; Fuglestvedt et al., 2008; Unger et al., 2010; Lund et al., 2020). A one-year pulse of present-day emissions has a small net global temperature effect on short time scales (+0.0011°C ± 0.0045°C), predominantly driven by CO2 and BC warming offset by NOx-induced cooling through methane lifetime reductions (Lund et al., 2020).The vehicle tailpipe emissions profiles of diesel and gasoline are distinctly different. Diesel air pollutant emissions are dominated by BC and NOx whereas gasoline air pollutant emissions are dominated by CO and NMVOCs, especially when distribution and upstream losses are considered. Thus, the net radiative effect of the on-road vehicle fleets depends upon the share of different fuels used, in particular gasoline and diesel (Lund et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2020). The net SLCF for year-2010 emissions from the global diesel vehicle fleet have been estimated to be +28 mW m–2 (Lund et al., 2014). Huang et al. (2020) estimated net global radiative effects of SLCFs (including aerosols, ozone, and methane) from the gasoline and diesel vehicle fleets in the year 2015 to be +13.6 and +9.4 mW m–2, respectively, with similar fractional contributions of SLCFs to the total global climate impact including CO2 on the 20‐year time scale (14–15%).There is consensus that on‐road transportation sector emissions, including gasoline and diesel, are important anthropogenic contributors to elevated surface ozone and PM2.5 concentrations (Chambliss et al. , 2014; Lelieveld et al., 2015b ; Silva et al. , 2016; Anenberg et al. , 2019). At a global scale, land transportation has been estimated to be the dominant contributor to surface ozone concentrations in populated areas (Silva et al., 2016) and ozone-induced vegetation damages (Section 6.4.4; Unger et al., 2020). Furthermore, it is now well established that real-world diesel NOx emissions rates are substantially higher, the so-called ‘excess NOx’, in all regional markets than in laboratory tests, worsening air quality (Anenberg et al., 2017; Jonson et al., 2017; Chossière et al., 2018) and contributing to slightly larger warming on the scale of years and smaller warming at the decadal scale (Tanaka et al., 2018). Excess NOx emissions from key global diesel markets are estimated at 4.6 Tg yr–1 in 2015, with annual mean ozone and PM2.5 increases of 1 ppb and 1µg m–3across large regions of Europe, India and China (Anenberg et al., 2017).In summary, the present-day global land-based transport pulse emissions cause a net global warming on all time scales (high confidence) and are detrimental to air quality (high confidence).
