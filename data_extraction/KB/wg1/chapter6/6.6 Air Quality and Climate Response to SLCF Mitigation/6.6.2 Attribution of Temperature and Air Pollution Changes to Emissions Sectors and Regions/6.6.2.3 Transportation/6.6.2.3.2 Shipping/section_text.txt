Quantifying the effects of shipping on climate is particularly challenging because (i) the sulphate cooling impact is dominated by aerosol–cloud interactions and (ii) ship emissions contain NOx, SOx and BC, which lead to mixed particles. Previous estimates of the sulphate radiative effects from present-day shipping span the range –47 to –8 mW m–2 (direct radiative effect) and –600 to –38 mW m–2 (indirect radiative effects) (Lauer et al. , 2007; Balkanski et al. , 2010; Eyring et al. , 2010; Lund et al. , 2012). Partanen et al. (2013) reported a global mean ERF for year-2010 shipping aerosol emissions of –390 mW m–2. The temperature change has been shown to be highly sensitive to the choice of aerosol–cloud parametrization (Lund et al., 2012). One year of global present-day shipping emissions, not considering the impact of recent low sulphur fuel regulation (IMO, 2016), are estimated to cause net cooling in the near term (–0.0024°C ± 0.0025°C) and slight warming (+0.00033°C ± 0.00015°C) on a 100-year horizon (Lund et al., 2020).Shipping is also of importance for air pollution in coastal areas along the major trade routes, especially in Europe and Asia (Corbett  et al. , 2007; H. Liu et al. , 2016, Figure 6.17; Jonson et al. , 2020). Jonson et al. (2020) estimated that shipping is responsible for 10% or more of the controllable PM2.5 concentrations and depositions of oxidised nitrogen and sulphur for many coastal countries. Widespread introduction of low-sulphur fuels in shipping from 2020 (IMO, 2016) will lead to improved air quality and reduction in premature mortality and morbidity (Sofiev et al., 2018).In summary, a year’s worth of present-day global shipping emissions (i.e., without the implementation of the 2020 clean fuel standards) cause a net global cooling (–0.0024 ± 0.0025°C) on 10–20 year time horizons (high confidence) but its magnitude is of low confidence.
