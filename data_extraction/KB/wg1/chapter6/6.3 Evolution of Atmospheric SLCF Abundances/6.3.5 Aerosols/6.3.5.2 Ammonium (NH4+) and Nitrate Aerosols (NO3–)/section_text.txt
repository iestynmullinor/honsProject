Ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate aerosols are formed when NH3 reacts with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4), produced in the atmosphere by the oxidation of NOx and SO2 respectively. Ammonium nitrate is formed only after H2SO4 is fully neutralized. NH4+ and NO3–aerosols produced via these gas-to-particle reactions are a major fraction of fine-mode particles (with diameter <1µm) affecting air quality and climate. Coarse-mode nitrate, formed by the heterogeneous reaction of nitric acid with dust and sea salt, dominates the overall global nitrate burden, but has little radiative effect (Hauglustaine et al., 2014; Bian et al., 2017). Trends in ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3–) were not assessed in AR5.Global model present-day estimates of the global NH4+burden range from 0.1–0.6 TgN (Bian et al., 2017). Models generally simulate surface NH4+ concentrations better than surface NH3 concentrations (Bian et al., 2017), which reflects its thermodynamic control by SO42–rather than NH3 (Shi et al., 2017). The concomitant increases of NH3, SO2, and NOx emissions (see Section 6.2) have led to a factor of three to nine increase in the simulated NH4+burden from 1850–2000 (Hauglustaine et al., 2014; Lund et al., 2018a), driven primarily by ammonium sulphate (70–90%). The increases in the NH3 and NH4+burdens are indirectly supported by the observed increase of NH4+ concentration in ice cores in mid- to high latitudes (Kang et al. , 2002; Kekonen et al. , 2005; Lamarque et al. , 2013; Iizuka et al. , 2018).Ammonium nitrate is semi-volatile, which results in complex spatial and temporal patterns in its concentrations (Putaud et al., 2010; Hand et al., 2012a; H. Zhang et al., 2012), reflecting variations in its precursors, NH3 and HNO3, as well as SO42–, non-volatile cations, temperature and relative humidity (Nenes et al. , 2020). High relative humidity and low temperature as well as elevated fine particulate matter loading (Huang et al. , 2014; Petit  et al. , 2015; H. Li et al. , 2016; Sandrini et al. , 2016)  favour nitrate production. Measurements reveal the high contribution of NO3– to surface PM2.5 (>30%) in regions with elevated regional NOx and NH3 emissions, such as the Paris area (Beekmann et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2019), northern Italy (Masiol et al., 2015; Ricciardelli et al., 2017), Salt Lake City (Kuprov et al., 2014; Franchin et al., 2018), the North China Plains (Guo et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016) and New Delhi(Pant et al., 2015). Recent observations also show that ammonium nitrate contributes to the Asian tropopause aerosol layer (Vernier et al., 2018; Höpfner et al., 2019). Model diversity in simulating the present-day global fine-mode NO3–burden is large with two multi-model intercomparison studies reporting estimates in the range of 0.14–1.88 Tg and 0.08–0.93 Tg respectively (Bian et al., 2017; Gliß et al., 2021). Models differ in their estimates of the global tropospheric nitrate burden by up to a factor of 13 with differences remaining nearly the same across the CMIP5 and CMIP6 generation of models (Bian et al., 2017; Gliß et al., 2021). While regional patterns in the concentration of fine-mode NO3– are qualitatively captured by models, the simulation of fine-mode NO3–is generally worse than that of NH4+or SO42– (Bian et al., 2017). This can be partly attributed to the semi-volatile nature of ammonium nitrate and biases in the simulation of its precursors (Heald et al., 2014; Paulot et al., 2016), including the sub-grid scale heterogeneity in NOx and NH3 emissions (Zakoura and Pandis, 2018).Models indicate that the burden of fine-mode NO3–has increased by a factor of two to five from 1850–2000 (Xu and Penner, 2012; Hauglustaine et al., 2014; Lund et al., 2018a), an increase that has accelerated between 2001 and 2015 (Lund et al., 2018a; Paulot et al., 2018b). The sensitivity of NO3– to changes in NH3, SO42–, and HNO3 is determined primarily by aerosol pH, temperature, and aerosol liquid water (Guo et al., 2016, 2018; Weber et al., 2016; Nenes et al., 2020). In regions where aerosol pH is high, changes in NO3–follow changes in NOx emissions, consistent with the observed increase of ammonium nitrate in northern China from 2000–2015 (Wen et al., 2018) and its decrease in the US Central Valley (Pusede et al., 2016). In contrast, the decrease in SO2 emissions in the south-east USA has caused little change in NO3– from 1998–2014 as nitric acid largely remains in the gas phase due to highly acidic aerosols (Weber et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2018).In summary, there is  high confidence that the NH4+ and NO3–burdens have increased from the pre-industrial period to the present day, although the magnitude of the increase is uncertain especially for NO3–. The sensitivity of NH4+ and NO3– to changes in NH3, H2SO4 and HNO3 is well understood theoretically. However, it remains challenging to represent in models, in part because of uncertainties in the simulation of aerosol pH, and only a minority of ESMs consider nitrate aerosols in CMIP6.
