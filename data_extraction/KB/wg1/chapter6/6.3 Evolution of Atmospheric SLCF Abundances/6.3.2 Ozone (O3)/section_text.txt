Ninety percent of the total column ozone (TCO) resides in the stratosphere. The chemical lifetime of ozone in the stratosphere ranges from less than a day in the upper stratosphere to several months in the lower stratosphere (Bekki and Lefevre, 2009). Global stratospheric ozone trends based on observations are assessed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.2.5.2). The CMIP6 model ensemble shows that global TCO has slightly changed from 1850–1960 (Keeble et al., 2021). The rapid decline in the 1970s and 1980s due to halogenated ozone-depleting substances (ODSs, as assessed in Section 2.2.5.2 from observations) until the end of the 1990s, followed by a slight increase since then, is captured by the models (Keeble et al., 2021). Overall, the observed climatology patterns and annual cycle amplitudes are well represented in the CMIP6 ensemble mean. The CMIP6 ensemble overestimates the observed TCO values by up to 6% (10–20 Dobson Units (DU)) globally in the NH and SH mid-latitudes, and in the tropics, but the trend in these regions is well captured between 1960 and 2014. However, there is poor agreement between the individual CMIP6 models in the pre-industrial period and throughout the historical period, with model TCO values spread across a range of about 60 DU. The global stratospheric ozone column decreased by 14.3 ± 8.7 DU from 1850–2014 (Keeble et al., 2021).Model simulations attribute about half of the observed upper-stratospheric ozone increase after 2000 to the decline of ODS since the late 1990s while the other half of the ozone increase is attributed to the slowing of gas-phase ozone destruction cycles due to cooling of the upper stratosphere by increasing GHGs (Aschmann et al., 2014; Oberländer-Hayn et al., 2015).In summary, global stratospheric ozone column has decreased from pre-industrial period to present day in response to the ODS-induced ozone rapid decline in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by slow, and still incomplete, recovery. There is medium confidence that global stratospheric ozone column has changed by 14.3 ± 8.7 DU between 1850 and 2014.
