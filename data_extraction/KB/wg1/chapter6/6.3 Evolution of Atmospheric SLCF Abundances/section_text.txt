The atmospheric oxidising capacity is determined primarily by tropospheric hydroxyl (OH) radical and to a smaller extent by NO3 radical, ozone, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and halogen radicals. OH is the main sink for many SLCFs, including methane, halogenated compounds (HCFCs and HFCs), CO and NMVOCs, controlling their lifetimes and consequently their abundance and climate influence. OH-initiated oxidation of methane, CO and NMVOCs in the presence of NOx leads to the production of tropospheric ozone. OH also contributes to the formation of aerosols from oxidation of SO2 to sulphate and NMVOCs to secondary organic aerosols. The evolution of the atmospheric oxidising capacity of the Earth driven by human activities and natural processes is, therefore, of significance for climate and air-quality concerns.The main source of tropospheric OH is the photoexcitation of tropospheric ozone that creates an electronically excited oxygen atom which reacts with water vapour producing OH. A secondary source of importance for global OH is the recycling of peroxy radicals formed by the reaction of OH with reduced and partly oxidized species, including methane, CO and NMVOCs. In polluted air, NOx emissions control the secondary OH production, while in pristine air it occurs via other mechanisms involving, in particular, isoprene (Lelieveld et al., 2016; Wennberg et al., 2018). Knowledge of the effect of isoprene oxidation on OH recycling has evolved tremendously over the past decade, facilitating mechanistic explanation of elevated OH concentrations observed in locations characterised by low NOx levels (Hofzumahaus et al. , 2009; Paulot  et al. , 2009; Peeters et al. , 2009, 2014; Fuchs et al. , 2013). Since AR5, the inclusion of improved chemical mechanisms in some CTMs suggest advances in understanding of the global OH budget, however, these improvements have yet to be incorporated in CMIP6-generation ESMs.As a result of the complex photochemistry, tropospheric OH abundance is sensitive to changes in SLCF emissions as well as climate. Increases in methane, CO and NMVOCs reduce OH while increases in water vapour and temperature, incoming solar radiation, NOx and tropospheric ozone enhance OH. The OH level thus responds to climate change and climate variability via its sensitivity to temperature and water vapour, as well as the influence of climate on natural emissions (e.g., wetland methane emissions, lightning NOx, BVOCs, fire emissions) with consequent feedbacks on climate (Section 6.4.5). Climate modes of variability, like El Niño–Southern Oscillation, also contribute to OH variability via changes in lightning NOx emissions and deep convection (Turner et al. , 2018), and fire emissions (Rowlinson et al., 2019).Global-scale OH observations are non-existent because of its extremely short lifetime (around 1 second) and therefore global OH abundance and its time variations are either inferred from atmospheric measurements of methyl chloroform (MCF; Prinn et al., 2018 and references therein) or derived from global atmospheric chemistry models (Lelieveld et al., 2016). The AR5 reported small interannual OH variations in the 2000s based on atmospheric inversions of MCF observations (within ±5%) and global CCMs and CTMs (within ±3%) (Ciais et al., 2013).Since AR5, there is much closer agreement in the estimates of interannual variations in global mean OH derived from atmospheric inversions, empirical reconstruction, and global CCMs and ESMs, with an estimate of 2–3% over the 1980–2015 period (Table 6.7). While the different methodologies agree on the occurrence of small interannual variations, there is much debate over the longer-term global OH trend. Two studies using multi-box model inversions of MCF and methane observations suggest large positive and negative trends since the 1990s in global mean OH (Rigby et al., 2017;Turner et al., 2017), however, both find that observational constraints are weak, such that a wide range of multi-annual OH variations are possible. Indeed, Naus et al. (2019) find an overall positive global OH trend over the past two decades (Table 6.7) after accounting for uncertainties and biases in atmospheric MCF and methane inversions, confirming the weakness in observational constraints for deriving OH trends. Global ESMs, CCMs and CTMs exhibit increasing global OH after 1980 contrary to the lack of trend derived from some atmospheric inversions and empirical reconstructions (Table 6.7). In particular, a three-member ensemble of ESMs participating in the AerChemMIP/CMIP6 agrees that global OH has increased since 1980 by around 9% (Figure 6.9) with an associated reduction in methane lifetime (Stevenson et al., 2020). This positive OH trend is in agreement with the OH increase of about 7% derived by assimilating global-scale satellite observations of CO over the 2002–2013 period (with CO declining trends) into a CCM (Section 6.3.4; Gaubert et al., 2017). Multi-model sensitivity analysis suggests that increasing OH since 1980 is predominantly driven by changes in anthropogenic SLCF emissions with the complementary influence of increasing NOx and decreasing CO emissions (Stevenson et al., 2020).Table 6.7 | Summary of global OH trends and interannual variability from studies post 2010.

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 6.SM.3). Open figureOver paleo time scales, proxy-based observational constraints from methane and formaldehyde suggest tropospheric OH to be a factor of two to four lower in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) relative to pre-industrial levels, though these estimates are highly uncertain (Alexander and Mickley, 2015). Global models, in contrast, exhibit no change in tropospheric OH (and consequently in methane lifetime) at the LGM relative to the pre-industrial period (Murray et al. , 2014; Quiquet  et al. , 2015), however, the sign and magnitude of OH changes are sensitive to model predictions of changes in natural emissions, including lightning NOx and BVOCs, and model representation of isoprene oxidation chemistry (Achakulwisut et al., 2015; Hopcroft et al., 2017).Regarding change since the pre-industrial era, at the time of the AR5, the ensemble mean of 17 global models participating in ACCMIP indicated little change in tropospheric OH from 1850–2000. This was due to the competing and finally offsetting changes in factors enhancing or reducing OH with a consequent small decline in methane lifetime (Naik et al., 2013; Voulgarakis et al., 2013). However, there was large diversity in both the sign and magnitude of past OH changes across the individual models attributed to the disparate implementation of chemical and physical processes (Nicely et al., 2017; Wild et al., 2020). Analysis of historical simulations from three CMIP6 ESMs indicates little change in global mean OH from 1850 to about 1980 (Stevenson et al., 2020). However, there is no observational evidence of changes in global OH since 1850 up to the early 1980s to evaluate the ESMs.In summary, global mean tropospheric OH does not show a significant trend from 1850 up to around 1980 (low confidence). There is conflicting information from global models constrained by emissions versus observationally constrained inversion methods over the 1980–2014 period. A positive trend since 1980 (about 9% increase over 1980–2014) is a robust feature among ESMs and CCMs and there is medium confidence that this trend is mainly driven by increases in global anthropogenic NOx emissions and decreases in CO emissions. There is limited evidence and medium agreement for positive trends or absence of trends inferred from observation-constrained methods. Overall, there is medium confidence that global mean OH has remained stable or exhibited a positive trend since the 1980s.
