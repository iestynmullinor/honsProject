The AR5 did not assess trends in SO2 concentrations. Trends in SO2 abundances are consistent with the overall anthropogenic emissions changes as presented in Section 6.2 and Figure 6.18. Long-term surface-based in situ observations in North America and Europe show reductions of more than 80% since the measurements began around 1980 (Table 6.5). Europe had the largest reductions in the first part of the period while the highest reduction came later in North America. Observed trends are qualitatively reproduced by global and regional models over North America and Europe during the period 1990–2015 for which emissions changes are well quantified (Table 6.5; Aas et al., 2019).Table 6.5 | Summary of changes or trends in atmospheric abundance of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphate (SO42–) aerosols based on in situ and satellite observations.

However, the limited in situ observations in Eastern Asia indicate an increase in atmospheric SO2 up to around 2005 and then a decline (Aas et al., 2019). This is confirmed by satellite observations (Krotkov et al., 2016), which further reveal a rapid decline in SO2 since around 2012 or 2013 (Krotkov et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2018b). In India, on the other hand, SO2 levels have doubled between 2005 and 2015 (Krotkov et al., 2016).In summary, surface and satellite observations indicate strong regional variations in trends of atmospheric SO2 abundance. The SO2 concentrations in North America and Europe have declined over 1980–2015 with slightly stronger reductions in North America (70 ± 20%) than in Europe (58 ± 32%) over 2000–2015, though Europe had larger reductions than the US in the prior decade (1990–2000). In Asia, the SO2 trends are more scattered, though there is medium confidence that there was a strong increase up to around 2005, followed by a steep decline in China, while over India, the concentrations are increasing steadily.
