The distribution of tropospheric NOx is highly variable in space and time owing to its short lifetime coupled with highly heterogeneous emission and sink patterns. NOx undergoes chemical processing, including the formation of nitric acid (HNO3), nitrate (NO–3), and organic nitrates (e.g., alkyl nitrate and peroxyacyl nitrate), atmospheric transport, and deposition. Despite challenges in retrieving quantitative information from satellite observations (Duncan et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Lorente et al., 2017; Silvern et al., 2018), improved accuracy and resolution of satellite-derived tropospheric NO2 columns over the past two decades have advanced understanding of the global distribution, long-term trends and source attribution of NOx. Long-term average tropospheric NO2 column based on multiple satellite-borne instruments (Figure 6.6a) reveals the highest NO2 levels over the most populated, urbanized and industrialized regions of the world corresponding to high NOx emissions source regions (Krotkov et al., 2016; Georgoulias et al., 2019). Enhanced but highly variable NO2 columns are also associated with biomass-burning regions as well as areas influenced by lightning activity (Miyazaki et al., 2014; Tanimoto et al., 2015).Figure 6.6 | Long-term climatological mean (a) and time evolution (b) of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) vertical column density. Data are from the merged GOME/SCIAMACHY/GOME-2 (TM4NO2A version 2.3) dataset for the period 1996–2016 (Georgoulias et al., 2019). Time evolution of NO2 column shown in panel (b) is normalized to the fitted 1996 levels for the 10 regions shown as boxes in panel (a). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 6.SM.3). Open figureObservational constraints derived from the isotopic composition of atmospheric nitrate inferred from ice cores provide evidence of increasing anthropogenic NOx sources since pre-industrial times (Hastings et al., 2009; Geng et al., 2014). Global NOx emissions trends in bottom-up inventories (Section 6.2.1) as well as model simulations of nitrogen deposition (Lamarque et al., 2013a) are in qualitative agreement with these observational constraints. CMIP6 ESMs exhibit stable NOx4 burden over the first half of the 20th century and then a sharp increase driven by a factor of three increase in emissions, however, the magnitude of this increase remains uncertain due to poor observational constraints on pre-industrial concentrations of NOx (Griffiths et al., 2021).The AR5 reported NO2 decreases by 30–50% in Europe and North America, and increases by more than a factor of two in Asia, over the 1996–2011 period based on satellite observations (Hartmann et al., 2013). Extension of this analysis covering the time period up to 2015 reveals that NO2 has continued to decline over the USA, Western Europe and Japan (Schneider et al., 2015; Duncan et al., 2016; Krotkov et al., 2016) because of effective fossil fuel NOx emissions controls (Section 6.2), although this rate of decline has slowed down post-2011 (Jiang et al., 2018). Satellite observations also reveal a 32% decline in NO2 column over China after peaking in 2011 (Figure 6.6b), consistent with declining NOx emissions (Section 6.2) due to the implementation of emissions-control strategies (de Foy et al. , 2016; Irie et al. , 2016; F. Liu et al. , 2016). Over Southern Asia, tropospheric NO2 levels have grown rapidly with increases of 50% during 2005–2015, largely driven by hotspot areas in India experiencing rapid expansion of the power sector (Duncan et al., 2016; Krotkov et al., 2016). Further analysis indicates that many parts of India have also undergone a reversal in NO2 trends since 2011 that has been attributed to a combination of factors, including a slowdown in economic growth, implementation of cleaner technologies, non-linear NOx chemistry, and meteorological variability (Georgoulias et al., 2019). Satellite data reveals spatially heterogeneous NO2 trends over the Middle East with an overall increase over 2005–2010 and a decrease over large parts of the region after 2011–2012. The reasons for trend reversal within individual areas are diverse, including warfare, imposed sanctions, and air-quality controls (Lelieveld et al., 2015a; Georgoulias et al., 2019). Satellite-derived tropospheric NO2 levels over Africa and Latin America do not show a clear trend; both increasing and decreasing trends are observed over large agglomerations in these regions since the early 2000s (Schneider et al., 2015; Duncan et al., 2016).In summary, global tropospheric NOx abundance has increased from 1850–2015 (high confidence). Satellite observations of tropospheric NOx indicate strong regional variations in trends over 2005–2015. There is  high confidence that NO2 has declined over the USA and Western Europe since the mid-1990s and increased over China until 2011. NO2 trends have reversed (declining) over China beginning in 2012 and NO2 has increased over Southern Asia by 50% since 2005 (medium confidence).Table 6.4 | Summary of the global CO trends based on model estimates and observations.
