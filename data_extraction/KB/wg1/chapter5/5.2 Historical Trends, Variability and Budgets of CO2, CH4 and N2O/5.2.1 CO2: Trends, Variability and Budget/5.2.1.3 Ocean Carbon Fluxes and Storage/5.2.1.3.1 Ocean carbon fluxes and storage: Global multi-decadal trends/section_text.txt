In the first assessment approach, the mean global multi-decadal (1960–2019) trends in the ocean sink (Socean) for CO2 show a high degree of coherence across the nine GOBMs and sixpCO2 -based observational product reconstructions (1987–2018) which, despite a temporary slowdown (or ‘hiatus’) in the 1990s, is also quasi-linear over that period (Figure 5.8a; Gregor et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). This coherence between the GOBMs and observations-based reconstructions (1987–2018; r2=0.85) provides  high confidence that the ocean sink (Socean in Section 5.2.1.5) evaluated from GOBMs (1960–2019) grew quasi-linearly from 1.0 ± 0.3 PgC yr–1 to 2.5 ± 0.6 PgC yr–1 between the decades 1960–1969 and 2010–2019 in response to global CO2 emissions (Figure 5.8a; Table 5.1; Friedlingstein et al., 2020; Hauck et al., 2020). The cumulative ocean CO2 uptake (105 ± 20 PgC) is 23% of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions (450 ± 50 PgC) for the same period (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). Notwithstanding the  high confidence in the magnitude of the annual to decadal trends for Socean,  this assessment is moderated to mediumconfidence by the low confidence in the currently inadequately constrained uncertainties in the pre-industrial land-to-ocean carbon flux, the uncertain magnitude of winter outgassing from the Southern Ocean, and the uncertain effect of the ocean surface cool-skin, the effect of data sparsity, differences between wind products and the uncertain contribution from the changing land–ocean continuum on global and regional fluxes (Jacobson et al., 2007; Resplandy et al., 2018; Roobaert et al., 2018; Bushinsky et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020; Watson et al., 2020; Gloege et al., 2021). However, both GOBMs and pCO2 -based observational products independently reveal a slowdown or ‘hiatus’ of the ocean sink in the 1990s, which provides a valuable constraint for model verification and leads to greater confidence in the model outputs  (Figure 5.8a; Landschützer et al., 2016; Gregor et al., 2018; DeVries et al., 2019; Hauck et al., 2020). A number of studies point to the role of the Southern Ocean in the global ‘1990s hiatus’ in air–sea CO2 fluxes, but provide different process-based explanations linking ocean temperature, mixing and meridional overturning circulation (MOC) responses to variability in large-scale climate systems, wind stress and volcanic activity, as well as the sensitivity of the air–sea CO2 flux to small changes in the atmospheric forcing from anthropogenic CO2 (Landschützer et al., 2016; DeVries et al., 2017; Bronselaer et al., 2018; Gregor et al., 2018; Gruber et al., 2019a; Keppler and Landschützer, 2019; McKinley et al., 2020; Nevison et al., 2020). Data sparsity in the Southern Ocean could also be a factor amplifying the global decadal perturbation of the 1990s (Gloege et al., 2021). Therefore, while there is  high confidence in the 1990s hiatus of the global ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2,  and that the Southern Ocean makes an observable contribution to it, there is still low confidence in the attribution for the processes behind the 1990s hiatus (Section 5.2.1.3.2). Observed increases in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of oceanpCO2 and reductions in the mean global buffering capacity provide  high confidence that the growing CO2 sink is also beginning to drive observable large-scale changes in ocean carbonate chemistry (Jiang et al., 2019). However, there is medium confidence that these changes which, depending on the emissions scenario, could drive future ocean feedbacks, are still too small to emerge from the historical multi-decadal observed growth rate of Socean (Sections 5.1.2; 5.3.2 and 5.4.2, and Figure 5.8a; SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3.2; Bates et al., 2014; Sutton et al., 2016; Fassbender et al., 2017; Landschützer et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2019). A recent model-based study suggests that re-emergence of previously stored anthropogenic CO2 is changing the buffering capacity of the mixed layer and reducing the ocean sink for anthropogenic CO2 during the historical period (Rodgers et al., 2020). This trend is not reflected in observations-based products (Figure 5.8a), so we attribute a low confidence.Figure 5.8 | Multi-decadal trends for the ocean sink of CO2 .  (a) The multi-decadal (1960–2019) trends in the annual ocean sink (Socean) reconstructed from nine Global Ocean Biogeochemical Models (GOBM) forced with atmospheric re-analysis products (Hauck et al., 2020), six observationally based gap-filling products that reconstructed spatial and temporal variability in the ocean CO2 flux from sparse observations of surface oceanpCO2 (Supplementary Materials 5.SM.2). The trends in Socean were calculated from the mean annual GOBM outputs, and the observational products were used to provide confidence in the GOBM assessments (r2=0.85). Thick lines represent the multi-model mean. Observationally based products have been corrected for pre-industrial river carbon fluxes (0.62 PgC yr–1) based on the average of estimates from Jacobson et al. (2007) and Resplandy et al. (2018).  (b) Mean decadal constraints and their confidence intervals for global ocean sink (Socean) of anthropogenic CO2 using multiple independent or quasi-independent lines of evidence or methods for the period 1990–2019 (see Supplementary Materials Tables 5.SM.1 and 5.SM.2 for magnitudes, uncertainties and published sources). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6). Open figureThe second assessment approach makes use of six independent methods to constrain the mean decadal ocean sink over the period 1990–2019 (Figure 5.8b). This provides a multi-decadal advance on the 1990–1999 decadal constraint from (Denman et al., 2007) that has been widely used as a model constraint for GOBMs used for the global carbon budget (Hauck et al., 2020). The medium confidence attributed by this assessment of the global multi-decadal trend (Figure 5.8a) is further supported by the broad agreement in magnitude and trend of the decadal mean ocean CO2 uptake with assessments that also include additional observations-based, independent methods such as ocean CO2 inversion and atmospheric CO2 and O2/N2 measurements (Figure 5.8b; Supplementary Materials Tables 5.SM.1 and 5.SM.2).Here we provide a third comparative assessment approach depicting the spatial coherence of ocean air–sea fluxes and storage rates of CO2 as well as a quantitative assessment of both fluxes for the same period (1994–2007; Figure 5.9). Observation-based pCO2 flux products show that emissions of natural CO2 occur mostly in the tropics and high-latitude Southern Ocean, and that the uptake and storage of anthropogenic CO2 occurs predominantly in the mid-latitudes (Chapter 9, Figure 5.9 and Cross-Chapter Box 5.3). Strong ocean CO2 sink regions are those in the mid-latitudes associated with the cooling of poleward flowing subtropical surface waters as well as equatorward flowing sub-polar surface waters, both of which contribute to the formation of Mode, Intermediate and Deep water masses that transport anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean interior on time scales of decades to centuries in both hemispheres (Section 9.2.2.3 and Figure 5.9; DeVries, 2014; Gruber et al., 2019b; Wu et al., 2019). The mean decadal scale magnitude and uncertainties of Socean from net air sea fluxes (Fnet ) were calculated from an ensemble of six observational-based product reconstructions (Figure 5.9a) and the storage rates in the ocean interior derived from multiple ocean interior CO2 datasets (Gruber et al., 2019b; Figure 5.9b). The cumulative CO2 stored in the ocean interior from 1800 to 2007 has been estimated at 140 ±18 PgC (Gruber et al., 2019b). As reported in SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3.1; IPCC, 2019b), the net ocean CO2 storage between 1994–2007 was 29 ± 4 PgC, which corresponds to a mean storage of 26 ± 5% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions for that period (Gruber et al., 2019b). The resulting net annual storage rate of anthropogenic CO2, equivalent to Socean for the period mid-1994 to mid-2007 is 2.2 ± 0.3 PgC yr–1, which is in very close agreement with the top-down air–sea flux estimate of Socean of 2.1 ± 0.5 PgC yr–1 from GOBMs and 1.9 ± 0.3PgC yr–1 frompCO2 -based observational products with the steady river carbon flux correction of 0.62 PgC yr–1 for the same time period (Gruber et al., 2019b; Hauck et al., 2020). This close agreement between these independent ocean CO2 sink estimates derived from air–sea fluxes and storage rates in the ocean interior support the medium confidence assessment that the ocean anthropogenic carbon storage rates continue to be determined by the ocean sink (Socean) in response to growing CO2 emissions (Figure 5.9; McKinley et al., 2020).Figure 5.9 | Comparative regional characteristics of the mean decadal (1994–2007) sea-air CO2 flux (Fnet) and ocean storage of anthropogenic CO2 . (a)  Regional source–sink characteristics for contemporary ocean air–sea CO2 fluxes (Fnet ) derived from the ensemble of six observation-based products using Surface Ocean CO2 (Atlas (SOCAT)v6 observational dataset (Landschützer et al., 2014; Rödenbeck et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2014; Bakker et al., 2016; Denvil-Sommer et al., 2019; Gregor et al., 2019; Iida et al., 2021). Warm colours depict outgassing fluxes and black contours characterize the super-biomes defined from Fay and McKinley (2014) and adjusted by Gregor et al. (2019) also used to calculate the variability in regional flux anomalies (Supplementary Materials Figure 5.SM.1);  (b) The regional characteristics of the storage fluxes of CO2 in the ocean interior for the same period (Gruber et al., 2019b). The dots reflect ocean areas where the 1-sigma standard deviation of Fnet from the six observational-based product reconstructions is larger than the magnitude of the mean. This reflects source–sink transition areas where the mean Fnet is small and more strongly influenced by spatial and temporal variability across the products.
