Soils are the largest natural source of N2O, arising primarily from nitrogen processing associated with microbial nitrification and denitrification (Table 5.3; Butterbach-Bahl et al., 2013; Snider et al., 2015). Under some conditions, soils can also act as a net sink of N2O, but this effect is small compared to the overall source (Schlesinger, 2013). Since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3), improved global process-based models (Tian et al., 2019) suggest a present-day source of 6.7 (5.3–8.1) TgN yr–1 (2007–2016 average), which is consistent with the estimate in AR5. Process-based models and inventory-based methods show that increased N deposition has enhanced terrestrial N2O emissions by 0.8 (0.4–1.4 TgN yr–1) relative to approximately pre-industrial times, and by 0.2 (0.1–0.2) TgN yr–1 between the 1980s and 2007–2016 (limited evidence, medium agreement) (Figure 5.16; Tian et al., 2019). This estimate is at the high end of the range reported in AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3). Model projections further show that global warming has led to increased soil N2O emissions of 0.8 (0.3–1.3) TgN yr–1 since approximately pre-industrial times, of which about half occurred since the 1980s (limited evidence,  high agreement) (Tian et al., 2019, 2020).The SRCCL assessed that deforestation and other forms of land-use change significantly alter terrestrial N2O emissions through emission pulses following conversions, generally resulting in long-term reduced emissions in unfertilized ecosystems (medium evidence, high agreement). This conclusion is supported by a recent study demonstrating that the deforestation-pulse effect is offset by the effect of reduced area of mature tropical forests (Tian et al., 2020).Uncertainties remain in process-based models with respect to their ability to capture the complicated responses of terrestrial N2O emissions to rain pulses, freeze–thaw cycles and the net consequences of elevated levels of CO2 accurately (Tian et al., 2019). Emerging literature suggests that permafrost thaw may contribute significantly to arctic N2O emissions (Voigt et al., 2020), but these processes are not yet adequately represented in models and upscaling to large-scale remains a significant challenge.
