Since AR5 (WGI, Section 6.4.3), new estimates of the global ocean N2O source derived from ocean biogeochemistry models are 3.4 (2.5–4.3) TgN yr–1 for the period 2007–2016 (Figure 5.16; Manizza et al., 2012; Suntharalingam et al., 2012; Martinez-Rey et al., 2015; Landolfi et al., 2017; Buitenhuis et al., 2018; Tian et al., 2020). This is slightly lower than climatological estimates from empirically based methods and surface ocean data syntheses (Bianchi et al., 2012; S. Yang et al., 2020). Nitrous oxide processes in coastal upwelling zones continue to be poorly represented in global estimates of marine N2O emissions (Kock et al., 2016), but may account for an additional 0.2–0.6 TgN yr–1 of the global ocean source (Seitzinger et al., 2000; Nevison et al., 2004).In the oxic ocean (>97% of ocean volume), nitrification is believed to be the primary N2O source (Freing et al., 2012). In sub-oxic ocean zones (Section 5.3), where denitrification prevails, higher N2O yields and turnover rates make these regions potentially significant sources of N2O (Arévalo-Martínez et al., 2015; Babbin et al., 2015; Ji et al., 2015). The relative proportion of ocean N2O from oxygen-minimum zones is highly uncertain (Zamora et al., 2012). Estimates derived from in situ sampling, particularly in the eastern tropical Pacific, suggest significant fluxes from these regions, and potentially account for up to 50% of the global ocean source (Codispoti, 2010; Arévalo-Martínez et al., 2015; Babbin et al., 2015). However, recent global-scale analyses estimate lower contributions (4–7%, Battaglia and Joos, 2018b; Buitenhuis et al., 2018). Further investigation is required to reconcile these estimates and provide improved constraints on the N2O source from low-oxygen zones.Atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic N on oceans can stimulate marine productivity and influence ocean emissions of N2O. New ocean model analyses since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), suggest a relatively modest global potential impact of 0.01–0.32 TgN yr–1 (pre-industrial to present-day) equivalent to 0.5–3.3% of the global ocean N2O source (Suntharalingam et al., 2012; Jickells et al., 2017; Landolfi et al., 2017). However, larger proportionate impacts are predicted in nitrogen-limited coastal and inland waters downwind of continental pollution outflow, such as the Northern Indian Ocean (Jickells et al., 2017; Suntharalingam et al., 2019).Inland waters and estuaries are generally sources of N2O as a result of nitrification and denitrification of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, however, they can serve as N2O sinks in specific conditions (Webb et al., 2019). Since AR5 (WGI, 6.4.3), improved emissions factors, including their spatio-temporal scaling, and consideration of transport within the aquatic system allows for better constraint of these emissions (Murray et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2016; Lauerwald et al., 2019; Maavara et al., 2019; Kortelainen et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020). Despite uncertainties because of the side effects of canals and reservoirs on nutrient cycling, these advances permit attribution of a fraction of inland water N2O emissions to anthropogenic sources (Tian et al., 2020), which contributes to the increased anthropogenic share of the global N2O source in this report compared to AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013). As an indirect consequence of agricultural nitrogen use and waste-water treatment, the anthropogenic emissions from inland waters have increased by about a quarter (0.1 TgN yr–1) between the 1980s and 2007–2016 (Tian et al., 2020).
