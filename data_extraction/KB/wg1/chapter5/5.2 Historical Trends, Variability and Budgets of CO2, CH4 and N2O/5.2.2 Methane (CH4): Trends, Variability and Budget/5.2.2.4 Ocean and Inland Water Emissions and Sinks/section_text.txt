In AR5, the ocean CH4 emissions were reported together with geological emissions, summing up to 54 (33–75) Tg yr–1. Coastal oceans, fjords and mud volcanos are major sources of CH4 in the marine environment, but CH4 flux measurements are sparse. Saunois et al. (2020) estimate that the oceanic budget, including biogenic, geological and hydrate emissions from coastal and open ocean, is 6 (range 4–10) Tg yr–1 for the 2000s, which is in good agreement with an air–sea flux measurement-based estimate of 6–12 Tg yr–1 (Weber et al., 2019). When estuaries are included, the total oceanic budget is 9–22 Tg yr–1, with a mean value of 13 Tg yr–1. A recent synthesis suggests that CH4 emissions from shallow coastal ecosystems, particularly from mangroves, can be as high as 5–6 Tg yr–1 (Al-Haj and Fulweiler, 2020). The reservoir emissions, including coastal wetlands and tidal flats, contribute up to 13 Tg yr–1 (Borges and Abril, 2011; Deemer et al., 2016). Methane seepage from the Arctic shelf, possibly triggered by the loss of geological storage due to warming and thawing of permafrost and hydrate decomposition, has a wide estimated range of 0.0–17 Tg yr–1 (Shakhova et al., 2010, 2014, 2017; Berchet et al., 2016); advanced eddy covariance measurements put the best estimate at about 3 Tg yr–1 from the East Siberian Arctic shelf (Thornton et al., 2020). The current flux is expected  to be a mix of pre-industrial and climate change-driven fluxes, CH4 seepage is anticipated to increase in a warmer world (Dean et al., 2018).All geological sources around the world, including the coastal oceans and fjords, are estimated to emit CH4 in the range of 35–76 Tg yr–1 (Etiope et al., 2019). There is evidence that the ventilation of geological CH4 is likely  to be smaller than 15 Tg yr–1 (Petrenko et al., 2017; Hmiel et al., 2020). A lower geological CH4 ventilation will reduce the gap between bottom-up and top-down estimates (Table 5.2), but widen the gap in the ratio of fossil fuel-derived sources to the biogenic sources for matching the D14C-CH4 observations.Inland water (lakes, rivers, streams, ponds, estuaries) emissions are proportionally the largest source of uncertainty in the CH4 budget. Since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013), the inland water CH4 source has been revised from 8–73 Tg yr–1 (1980s) to 117–212 Tg yr–1 (2000s) with the availability of more observational data and improved areal estimates (Bastviken et al., 2011; Deemer et al., 2016; Stanley et al., 2016; DelSontro et al., 2018; Saunois et al., 2020). However, it is difficult to estimate bottom-up CH4 emissions, due to the large spatial and temporal variation in lake and river CH4 fluxes (Wik et al., 2016; Crawford et al., 2017; Natchimuthu et al., 2017), uncertainties in their global area (Allen and Pavelsky, 2018), a relatively small number of observations, and varying measurement methods – for example, those neglecting ebullition, varying upscaling methods, and lack of appropriate processes (Sanches et al., 2019; Engram et al., 2020; L. Zhang et al., 2020). Accordingly, there is no clear accounting of inland waters in top-down budgets, which is the main reason for the large gap in bottom-up and top-down estimates of ‘other sources’ in the CH4 budget (Table 5.2). Despite recent progress in separating wetlands from inland waters, there is double-counting in the bottom-up estimates of their emissions (Thornton et al., 2016a). Although there is evidence that regional human activities and global warming both increase inland water CH4 emissions (Beaulieu et al., 2019), the increase in the decadal emissions since AR5 (Ciais et al., 2013) rather reflect improvements in the estimate (medium confidence), due to updates in the datasets and new upscaling approaches (Saunois et al., 2020).
