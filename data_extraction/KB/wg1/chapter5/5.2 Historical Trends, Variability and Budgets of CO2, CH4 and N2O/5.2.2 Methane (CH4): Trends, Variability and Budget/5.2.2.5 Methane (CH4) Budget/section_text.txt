A summary of top-down and bottom-up estimates of CH4 emissions and sinks for the period 2008–2017 is presented in Figure 5.14 (details in Table 5.2 and the associated text for the emissions). In addition to 483-682 Tg yr–1loss of CH4 in the troposphere by reaction with OH, 1–35 Tg yr–1 of CH4 loss is estimated to occur in the lower troposphere due to Cl but are not included in the top-down models as shown in Table 5.2 (Hossaini et al., 2016; Gromov et al., 2018; X. Wang et al., 2019). The decadal mean CH44 burden/imbalance increased at the rate of 30, 12, 7 and 21 Tg yr–1 in the 1980s (1980–1989), 1990s (1990–1999), 2000s (2000–2009) and the most recent decade (2008–2017), respectively (virtually certain), as can be estimated from observed atmospheric growth rate (Cross-Chapter Box 5.2, Figure 1).Recent analysis using D14C-CH4 in ice samples suggest that CH4 emissions from fossil fuel exploitation are responsible for 30% of total CH4 emissions (Lassey et al., 2007; Hmiel et al., 2020), which is largely inconsistent with sectorial budgets where fossil fuel emissions add up to 20% only (Ciais et al., 2013). However, recent model simulations produce fairly consistent d13C-CH4 values and trends, as observed in the atmospheric samples using 20% fossil fuel emissions fraction (Ghosh et al., 2015; Warwick et al., 2016; Fujita et al., 2020; Strode et al., 2020). Further research is needed to clarify the relative roles of CH4 emissions from fossil fuel exploitation and freshwater components. A key challenge is to accommodate the higher estimated emissions from these two components without a major increase in the sinks, in order to be consistent with the observed changes in the carbon and hydrogen isotopes.Figure 5.14 | Global methane (CH4 ) budget (2008–2017). Values and data sources as in Table 5.2 (in TgCH4). The atmospheric stock is calculated from mean CH4 concentration, multiplying a factor of 2.75 ± 0.015 Tg ppb–1, which accounts for the uncertainties in global mean CH4 (Chandra et al., 2021). Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6). Open figure
