The AR5 (M. Collins et al., 2013) assessed that the TCRE is likely  to fall in the range of 0.8°C –2.5°C per 1000 PgC (or per exagrams of carbon, EgC–1) for cumulative emissions up to 2000 PgC, based on multiple lines of evidence. These include estimates based on ESMs of varying complexity (Matthews et al., 2009; Gillett et al., 2013; Zickfeld et al., 2013), simple climate modelling approaches (Allen et al., 2009; Rogelj et al., 2012) or observational constraints and attributable warming (Gillett et al., 2013).Since AR5, new studies have further expanded the evidence base for estimating the value of TCRE. These studies rely on ESMs or EMICs, observational constraints and concepts of attributable warming, or theoretically derived equations (see Table 5.7 for an overview). Several studies have endeavoured to partition the uncertainty in the value of TCRE into constituent sources. For example, TCRE can be decomposed into terms of TCR and the airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions over time (Allen et al., 2009; Matthews et al., 2009). These two terms are assessed individually (see Section 5.4 and Chapter 7, respectively) and allow the integration of evidence assessed elsewhere in the report into the assessment of TCRE (Section 5.5.1.4). Further studies use a variety of methods, including analysing the outputs from CMIP5 (R.G. Williams et al., 2017b) or CMIP6 (Arora et al., 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020), conducting perturbed parameter experiments with a single model (MacDougall et al., 2017), Monte-Carlo methods applied to a simple climate model (Spafford and Macdougall, 2020), or observations and estimates of the contribution of CO2 and non-CO2 forcers (Matthews et al., 2021). All of the studies agree that uncertainty in climate sensitivity – either equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) or transient climate response (TCR) – is among the most important contribution to uncertainty in TCRE, with uncertainty in the strength of the land carbon feedback and ocean heat uptake or ventilation having also been identified as crucial to uncertainty in TCRE (Matthews et al., 2009; Gillett et al., 2013; Ehlert et al., 2017; MacDougall et al., 2017; R.G. Williams et al., 2017a, 2020; Katavouta et al., 2019; Arora et al., 2020; Jones and Friedlingstein, 2020; Spafford and Macdougall, 2020). Finally, internal variability has been shown to affect the maximum accuracy of TCRE estimates by ±0.1°C per 1000 PgC (5–95% range; Tokarska et al., 2020).Table 5.7 | Overview of results from studies estimating the transient climate response to cumulative CO2  emissions (TCRE). GSAT = Global mean surface air temperature increase, SAT = surface air temperature (e.g., over land only), SST = sea surface temperature, ECS = equilibrium climate sensitivity.
