Use of TCRE for estimating remaining carbon budgets needs to consider the zero emissions commitment (ZEC), the potential additional warming after a complete cessation of net CO2 emissions. Based on the ZEC assessment presented in Section 4.7.1.1, the ZEC’s central value is taken to be zero with a likely range of ±0.19°C, noting that it might either increase or decrease after half a century. ZEC uncertainty is assessed for a time frame of half a century, as this most appropriately reflects the time between stringent mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 emissions and the end of the century. For shorter time horizons, a similar central zero value applies, but with a smaller range (MacDougall et al., 2020). Experiments that ramped up and down emissions following a bell-shaped trajectory (MacDougall and Knutti, 2016a) show that when annual CO2 emissions decline to zero at a pace consistent with those currently assumed in mitigation scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b), the ZEC will already be realized to a large degree at the time of reaching net zero CO2 emissions (MacDougall et al., 2020).
