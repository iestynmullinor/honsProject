Advances in methods to estimate remaining carbon budgets have shown the importance of applying an estimate of historical warming to date that is as accurate as possible (Millar et al., 2017b; Tokarska and Gillett, 2018). This becomes particularly important when assessing remaining carbon budgets for global warming levels that are relatively close to present-day warming, such as a 1.5°C or 2°C levels (Rogelj et al., 2018b). Also shown to be important is the definition of global average temperature by which historical warming is estimated (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3; Cowtan and Way, 2014; Allen et al., 2018; Pfleiderer et al., 2018; Richardson et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2019b), as is the correct isolation of human-induced global warming (Haustein et al., 2017; Allen et al., 2018) to remove the effect of internal variability. Based on the assessment in Section 3.3 (Table 3.1), here we apply an assessedbest-estimate of historical warming expressed as an increase in GSAT of 1.07°C (0.8–1.3°C, likely range) between 1850–1900 and 2010–2019. This choice implies global coverage and is consistent with AR5 where carbon budgets were reported in GSAT (M. Collins et al., 2013; T.F. Stocker et al., 2013), SR1.5 where GSAT was the central metric for remaining carbon budgets (Rogelj et al., 2018b), and recent studies that highlight how GSAT enables an easy translation with AR5 (Tokarska et al., 2019b). The use of other historical reference periods (Cross-Chapter Box 1.2) or temperature metrics and updated data products (Cross-Chapter Box 2.3) can result in a different estimated historical warming and thus a changed remaining carbon budget.
