Non-CO2 emissions contribute either cumulatively (N2O, and other long-lived climate forcers) or in proportion to their annual emissions (CH4 and other short-lived climate forcers) to global warming, and thus also affect estimates of remaining carbon budgets by reducing the amount of warming that could still result from CO2 emissions (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Knutti and Rogelj, 2015; Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2016; R.G. Williams et al., 2016, 2017b; Matthews et al., 2017; Collins et al., 2018; Mengis et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018; Zickfeld et al., 2021). The size of this contribution has been estimated both implicitly (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Friedlingstein et al., 2014a; Rogelj et al., 2016; Matthews et al., 2017; Mengis et al., 2018; Tokarska et al., 2018) and explicitly (Rogelj et al., 2015a, 2018b; Collins et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2021) by varying the assumptions of non-CO2 emissions and associated warming. Internally consistent evolutions of future CO2 and non-CO2 emissions allow for derivation of non-CO2 warming contributions consistent with global CO2 emissions reaching net zero levels, and therewith capping maximum future CO2 emissions (Smith and Mizrahi, 2013; Clarke et al., 2014; Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b; Matthews et al., 2021). Pathways that reflect such development typically show a stabilization or decline in non-CO2 radiative forcing and warming at, and after the time of, global CO2 emissions reaching net zero levels, as illustrated in the scenario database underlying SR1.5 (Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b).The impact of non-CO2 emissions on remaining carbon budgets is assessed with emulators (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Millar et al., 2017b; Gasser et al., 2018; Goodwin et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b; C.J. Smith et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2021) that incorporate synthesized climate and carbon-cycle knowledge (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1). The estimated implied non-CO2 warming can subsequently be applied to reduce the remaining allowable warming for estimating the remaining carbon budget (Figure 5.31; Rogelj et al., 2018b, 2019). Alternative methods estimate the non-CO2 fraction of total anthropogenic forcing (Matthews et al., 2021), or do not correct for non-CO2 warming directly. The latter methods instead consider CO2 and non-CO2 warming together to define a CO2 -forcing equivalent carbon budget from which eventual non-CO2 contributions expressed in CO2 -forcing-equivalent emissions have to be subtracted to obtain a remaining carbon budget (Jenkins et al., 2018; Matthews et al., 2020). These studies also use emulators to invert a specified evolution of non-CO2 forcing to a corresponding amount of equivalent CO2 emissions (Matthews et al., 2020), or alternatively use empirical relationships linking changes in non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions to warming (Cain et al., 2019). Methods to express non-CO2 emissions in CO2 equivalence are assessed in Section 7.6, yet their applicability and related uncertainties for remaining carbon budgets have not yet been covered in-depth in the literature.Application of the SR1.5 method (Forster et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b) with AR6-calibrated emulators (Box 7.1) suggests a median additional non-CO2 warming contribution at the time global CO2 emissions reach net zero levels of about 0.1°C–0.2°C relative to 2010–2019. Uncertainty surrounding this range due to geophysical uncertainties such as non-CO2 -forcing uncertainties and TCR is of the order of ±0.1°C. Differences in the choices of mitigation strategies considered in low-emissions scenarios (Huppmann et al., 2018) result in a potential additional variation around the central range of at least ±0.1°C (spread across scenarios, referred to as non-CO2 scenario uncertainty in Table 5.8).Table 5.8 | The assessed remaining carbon budget and corresponding uncertainties. Assessed estimates are provided for additional human-induced warming expressed as global average surface air temperature since the recent past (2010–2019), which likely amounted to 0.8 to 1.3 with a best estimate of 1.07°C relative to 1850–1900 (Table 3.1 in Chapter 3).

Warming reflects changes in GSAT, as TCRE and other estimates are GSAT-based. Combined with a central estimate of TCRE (1.65°C EgC–1) the uncertainty in historical human-induced GSAT warming results in a potential variation of remaining carbon budgets of ±150 PgC or ±550 GtCO2.bHistorical CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 have been estimated at about 655 ± 65 PgC (likely range, or 2390 ± 240 GtCO2, see Table 5.1). Note that 57 PgC (210 GtCO2) have been emitted from the middle of the 2010–2019 reference period (2015) until the end of 2019 (Friedlingstein et al., 2020).cTCRE: transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions, assessed to fall likely between 1.0–2.3°C EgC–1 with a normal distribution. PgC values are rounded to the nearest 10; GtCO2 values to the nearest 50. For comparison, assuming a lognormal distribution with a 1.0–2.3°C EgC–1central 66% range instead of a normal distribution would increase remaining carbon budgets at the 17th, 33rd, 50th, 67th, and 83rd percentile with 3%, 10%, 12%, 9%, 2%, respectively. Future non-CO2 contributions in these remaining carbon budget estimates are based on the scenarios assessed in the SR1.5 report and estimated as the median quantile regression of non-CO2 warming since 2010–2019 relative to total additional warming since 2010–2019 at the time scenarios reach net-zero CO2 emissions (Forster et al., 2018; Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b).dAdditional Earth system feedbacks are included in the remaining carbon budget estimates as discussed in Section 5.5.2.2.5. The tropospheric ozone and methane lifetime contributions are included through the non-CO2 warming projections by the AR6-calibrated Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) emulator, while the remaining feedbacks are assessed totalling a combined feedback of magnitude 7 ± 27 PgC K–1 (1-sigma range, or 26 ± 97 GtCO2 °C–1).eVariations due to different scenario assumptions related to the future evolution of non-CO2 emissions in mitigation scenarios reaching net zero CO2 emissions (Huppmann et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018b) of at least ±0.1°C (spread across scenarios). Combined with a central estimate of TCRE (1.65°C EgC–1) this results in at least ±60 PgC or ±220 GtCO2. This spread reflects the variation in the underlying scenario ensemble but is not a formal likelihood. WGIII will re-assess the potential for non-CO2 mitigation based on literature since SR1.5.f Remaining carbon budget variation due to geophysical uncertainty in forcing and temperature response of non-CO2 emissions of the order of ±0.1°C, very likely range (5–95%) of non-CO2 response (Section 5.5.2.2.3). Combined with a central estimate of TCRE (1.65°C EgC–1) this results in at least ±60 PgC or ±220 GtCO2.g The variation due to the ZEC is estimated for a central TCRE value of 1.65°C EgC–1 and a 1-sigma ZEC range of 0.19°C. In real-world pathways, the magnitude of this effect will depend on the pace of CO2 emissions reductions to net zero.hHistorical emissions uncertainty reflects the ±10% uncertainty in the historical emissions estimate since 1 January 2015.
