Modelling studies consistently show that, relative to a high-CO2 world without SRM, SRM-induced cooling (Section 4.6.3.3) would reduce plant and soil respiration, and also reduce the negative effects of warming on ocean carbon uptake (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Jiang et al., 2018; Muri et al., 2018; Sonntag et al., 2018; Plazzotta et al., 2019; C.-E. Yang et al., 2020). A multi-model study (Plazzotta et al., 2019) indicates that, relative to a high-CO2 concentration world without SRM, stratospheric sulphur dioxide (SO2) injection increases the allowable CO2 emissions by enhancing CO2 uptake by both land and ocean (Figure 5.37). As a result of enhanced global carbon uptake, SRM would reduce the burden of atmospheric CO2 (high confidence). However, the amount of SRM-induced reduction in atmospheric CO2 depends on the future emissions scenario and modelled oceanic and terrestrial carbon sinks, which differ widely between models (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2016; Cao and Jiang, 2017; Muri et al., 2018). Models that include the terrestrial nitrogen cycle usually report a much smaller reduction of atmospheric CO2 in response to SRM than models without the nitrogen cycle, mainly because nitrogen limitation leads to a weaker terrestrial carbon sink (Tjiputra et al., 2016; Muri et al., 2018; C.-E. Yang et al., 2020). Large-scale application of SAI is found to reduce the rate of release of CO2 and CH4 from permafrost thaw (Lee et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020).A hypothetical sudden and sustained termination of SRM would cause a rapid increase in global warming that would pose great risks to biodiversity (A. Jones et al., 2013; McCusker et al., 2014; Trisos et al., 2018) (Section 4.6.3.3). It would also weaken carbon sinks, accelerating atmospheric CO2 accumulation and inducing further warming (Figure 5.37; Matthews and Caldeira, 2007; Tjiputra et al., 2016; Muri et al., 2018; Plazzotta et al., 2019). However, a scenario with gradual phase-out of SRM under emissions reduction could reduce the large negative effect of sudden SRM termination (MacMartin et al., 2014; Keith and MacMartin, 2015; Tilmes et al., 2016),though this would be limited by how rapidly emissions reductions can be scaled-up (Ekholm and Korhonen, 2016).
