SAI is found  to reduce global average surface ozone concentration (Xia et al., 2017) mainly as a result of aerosol-induced reduction in stratospheric ozone at polar regions, resulting in reduced transport of ozone from the stratosphere (Pitari et al., 2014; Tilmes et al., 2018). The reduction in surface ozone, together with alteration to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, would have important implications for vegetation response (Xia et al., 2017). A modelling study shows that sea salt aerosol injection for MCB would reduce hydroxyl (OH) concentration and increase CH4 lifetime, and hence, have potential implications for surface ozone pollution (Horowitz et al., 2020). It has also been reported that the use of SAI to limit global mean warming from 2°C to 1.5°C would reduce fire weather in many areas (Burton et al., 2018).
