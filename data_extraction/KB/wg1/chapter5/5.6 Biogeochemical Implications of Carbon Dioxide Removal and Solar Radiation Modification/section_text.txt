SRM would alter the global carbon cycle through SRM-induced climate effect, such as changes in sunlight, temperature, precipitation, and ocean circulation. Compared to a high-CO2 world without SRM, SRM would enhance the net uptake of CO2 by the terrestrial biosphere and ocean, thus acting to reduce atmospheric CO2 (high confidence). SRM would also affect surface ozone, UV radiation, and atmospheric chemistry. Due to complex interplays between SRM-induced changes in direct and diffuse sunlight, temperature, the coupling of water-carbon-nitrogen cycles, and atmospheric chemistry, there is large uncertainty in the overall response of the terrestrial biosphere response to SRM. Thus, the level of  confidence on the effect of SRM on carbon and other biogeochemical cycles is low.
