Published examples of abrupt biogeochemical changes in models include tropical rain forest dieback (Cox et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2009; Brando et al., 2014; Le Page et al., 2017; Zemp et al., 2017), and temperate and boreal forest dieback (Joos et al., 2001; Lucht et al., 2006; Scheffer et al., 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016; Section 5.4.3). Such transitions may be related to: (i) large-scale changes in mean climate conditions crossing particular climate thresholds (Joos et al., 2001; Cox et al., 2004; Lucht et al., 2006; Hirota et al., 2011; Scheffer et al., 2012; Le Page et al., 2017; Zemp et al., 2017); (ii) temperature and precipitation extremes (Staver et al., 2011; Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Scheffer et al., 2012; Pavlov, 2015; Zemp et al., 2017); or (iii) possible enhancement and intermittency in fire activity (Staver et al., 2011; Higgins and Scheiter, 2012; Lasslop et al., 2016; Brando et al., 2020). Simulated changes in forest cover are a combination of the effects of CO2 on photosynthesis and water-use efficiency (Section 5.4.1), and the effects of climate change on photosynthesis, respiration and disturbance (Section 5.4.3). In ESMs, direct CO2 effects tend to enhance forest growth, but the impacts of climate change vary between being predominantly negative in the tropics and predominantly positive in the boreal zone (Figure 5.27).Most ESMs project continuing carbon accumulation in tropical forests as a result of direct CO2 effects overwhelming the negative effects of climate change (Huntingford et al., 2013; Drijfhout et al., 2015; Boulton et al., 2017). In the real world, forests may be less vulnerable to climate changes than those modelled in ESMs because of the greater plant trait diversity, which confers additional resilience (Reyer et al., 2015; Levine et al., 2016; Sakschewski et al., 2016), and because of possible acclimation of vegetation to warming (Good et al., 2011, 2013; Lloret et al., 2012; Mercado et al., 2018). On the contrary, forests may be more vulnerable in the real world due to indirect climate change effects such as insect outbreaks and diseases not considered here (Section 5.4.3.2) or model limitations in representing the effects disturbances such as wildfire and droughts. In general, forests are most vulnerable when climate change is combined with increased rates of direct deforestation (Nobre et al., 2016; Le Page et al., 2017).To estimate an upper limit on the impact of Amazon forest dieback on atmospheric CO2, we consider the very unlikely limiting case of negligible direct-CO2 effects (Section 5.4.1). Emergent constraint approaches (Section 5.4.6) may be used to estimate an overall loss of tropical land carbon due to climate change alone, of around 50 PgC per °C of tropical warming (Cox et al., 2013; Wenzel et al., 2014). This implies an upper limit to the release of tropical land carbon of <200 PgC over the 21st century (assuming tropical warming of <4°C,  and no CO2 -fertilization), which translates to dCO2 /dt <0.5 ppm yr–1.Boreal forest dieback is not expected to change the atmospheric CO2 concentration substantially because forest loss at the south is partly compensated by: (i) temperate forest invasion into previously boreal areas; and (ii) boreal forest gain at the north (Friend et al., 2014; Kicklighter et al., 2014; Schaphoff et al., 2016) (medium confidence). An upper estimate of this magnitude, based on statistical modelling of climate change alone, is of 27 Pg vegetation carbon loss in the southern boreal forest, which is roughly balanced by gains in the northern zone (Koven, 2013). Carbon release from vegetation and soil due to wildfires in boreal regions (Eliseev et al., 2014b; Turetsky et al., 2015; X.J. Walker et al., 2019) is also not expected to change this estimate substantially because of its small present-day value of about 0.2 PgC yr–1 (van der Werf et al., 2017), and because of likely  increases in precipitation in boreal regions (Section 4.5.1).
