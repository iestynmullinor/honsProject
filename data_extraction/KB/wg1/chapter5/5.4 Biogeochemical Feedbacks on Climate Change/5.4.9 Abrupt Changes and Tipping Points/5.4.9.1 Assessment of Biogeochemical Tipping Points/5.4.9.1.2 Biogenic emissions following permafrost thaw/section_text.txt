There is large uncertainty in release of GHGs from permafrost in the 21st century. The largest of these estimates implies tens to hundreds of gigatons of carbon released in the form of CO2 (Box 5.1) and CH4 emissions up to 100 TgCH4yr–1 (Box 5.1). A carbon dioxide release of such magnitude would lead to an increase in the CO2 accumulation rate in the atmosphere of ≤1 ppm yr–1. These emissions develop at a multi-decadal time scale. Assuming a CH4 lifetime in the atmosphere of the order of 10 years and the associated feedback parameter of 1.34 ± 0.04 (Section 6.2.2.1), this would increase the atmospheric CH4 content by about 500 ppb over the century, corresponding to a rate of ≤10 ppb yr–1. Irrespective of its origin, additional CH4 accumulation of such a magnitude is not expected to modify the temperature response to anthropogenic emissions by more than a few tenths of a °C (Gedney et al., 2004; Eliseev et al., 2008; Denisov et al., 2013). Emissions from permafrost thawing are assessed in Box 5.1.
