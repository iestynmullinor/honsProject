The total global clathrate reservoir is estimated to contain 1500–2000 PgC (Archer et al., 2009; Ruppel and Kessler, 2017), held predominantly in ocean sediments, with only an estimated 20 PgC in and under permafrost (Ruppel, 2015). The present-day CH4 release from shelf clathrates is <10 TgCH4yr–1 (Kretschmer et al., 2015; Saunois et al., 2020). Despite polar amplification (Chapter 7), substantial releases from the permafrost-embedded subsea clathrates is very unlikely  (Minshull et al., 2016; Malakhova and Eliseev, 2017, 2020). This is consistent with an overall small release of CH4 from the shelf clathrates during the last deglacial transition, despite large reorganizations in climate state (Bock et al., 2017; Petrenko et al., 2017; Dyonisius et al., 2020). The long time scales associated with clathrate destabilization makes itunlikely  that CH4 release from the ocean to the atmosphere will deviate markedly from the present-day value through the 21st century (Hunter et al., 2013), corresponding to no more than additional 20 ppb of atmospheric CH4 (i.e., <0.2 ppb yr–1). Another possible source of CH4 is gas clathrates in deeper terrestrial permafrost and below it (Buldovicz et al., 2018; Chuvilin et al., 2018), which may have caused recent craters in the north of Russia (Arzhanov et al., 2016, 2020; Arzhanov and Mokhov, 2017; Kizyakov et al., 2017, 2018). Land clathrates are formed at depths greater than 200 m (Ruppel and Kessler, 2017; Malakhova and Eliseev, 2020), which precludes a substantial response to global warming over the next few centuries and associated emissions.Thus, it is very unlikely  that CH4 emissions from clathrates will substantially warm the climate system over the next few centuries.
