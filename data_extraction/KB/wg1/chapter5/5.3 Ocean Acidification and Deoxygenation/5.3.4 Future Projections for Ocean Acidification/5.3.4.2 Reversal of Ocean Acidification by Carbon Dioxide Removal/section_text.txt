Reversing the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations through negative emissions (Section 5.6) will reverse ocean acidification at the sea surface (high confidence) but will not result in rapid amelioration of ocean acidification in the deeper ocean (Section 5.3.3.2). The oceanâ€™s uptake of atmospheric CO2 will start to decrease as atmospheric CO2 decreases (Sections 5.4.5, 5.4.10 and 5.6.2.1; Mathesius et al., 2015; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015). However, because of the long time scales of the ocean turnover that transfers CO2 from the upper to the deep ocean, excess carbon will continue to accumulate in the deep ocean even after a decrease in atmospheric CO2 (Cao et al., 2014; Mathesius et al., 2015; Tokarska and Zickfeld, 2015; T. Li et al., 2020). There is thus  high confidence that CO2 emissions leave a long-term legacy in ocean acidification, and are therefore irreversible at multi-human generational scales, even with aggressive atmospheric CO2 removal.
