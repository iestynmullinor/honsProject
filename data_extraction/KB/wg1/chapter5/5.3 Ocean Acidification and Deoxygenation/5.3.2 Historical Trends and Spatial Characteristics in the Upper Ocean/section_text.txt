The SROCC (Section 5.2.2.3) indicated that it is virtually certain that the ocean has undergone acidification globally in response to ocean CO2 uptake, and concluded that pH in open ocean surface water has changed by avirtually certain range of –0.017 to –0.027 pH units per decade since the late 1980s. Since SROCC, evidence of the progress of acidification across all regions of the oceans has been further strengthened by continued observations of seawater carbonate chemistry at ocean time series stations, and compiled shipboard studies providing temporally resolved and methodologically consistent datasets (Jiang et al., 2019) (Figure 5.20; Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3; Section 2.3.3.5).Figure 5.20 | Multi-decadal trends of pH (Total Scale) in surface layer at various sites of the oceans and a global distribution of annual mean pH adjusted to the year 2000. Time-series data of pH are from Dore et al. (2009), Olafsson et al. (2009), González-Dávila et al. (2010), Bates et al. (2014), Takahashi et al. (2014), Wakita et al. (2017), Merlivat et al. (2018), Ono et al. (2019), and Bates and Johnson (2020). Global distribution of annual mean pH have been evaluated from data of surface oceanpCO2 measurements (Bakker et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2019).

Further details on data sources and processing are available in the chapter data table (Table 5.SM.6). Open figureIn the subtropical open oceans, decreases in pH have been reported with avery likely rate range from –0.016 to –0.019 pH units per decade since 1980s, which equates to approximately 4 % increase in hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]) per decade. Accordingly, the saturation state Ω (=[Ca2+][CO32-]/Ksp) of seawater with respect to calcium carbonate mineral aragonite has been declining at rates ranging from –0.07 to –0.12 per decade (González-Dávila et al., 2010; Feely et al., 2012; Bates et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2014; Ono et al., 2019; Bates and Johnson, 2020; Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3). These rates are consistent with the rates expected from the transient equilibration with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but the variability of rate in decadal time scale has also been detected with robust evidence (Ono et al., 2019; Bates and Johnson, 2020). In the tropical Pacific, its central and eastern upwelling zones exhibited a faster pH decline of –0.022 to –0.026 pH unit per decade due to increased upwelling of CO2 -rich sub-surface waters in addition to anthropogenic CO2 uptake (Sutton et al., 2014; Lauvset et al., 2015). By contrast, warm pools in the western tropical Pacific exhibited slower pH decline of –0.010 to –0.013 pH unit per decade (Supplementary Material Table 5.SM.3; Lauvsetet al., 2015; Ishii et al., 2020). Observational and modelling studies (Nakano et al., 2015; Ishii et al., 2020) consistently suggest that slower acidification in this region is attributable to the anthropogenic CO2 taken up in the extratropics around a decade ago and transported to the tropics via shallow meridional overturning circulations.In open subpolar and polar zones, the very likely range (–0.003 to –0.026 pH unit per decade) and uncertainty (up to 0.010) observed in pH decline are larger than in the subtropics, reflecting the complex interplay between physical and biological forcing mechanisms (Olafsson et al., 2009; Midorikawa et al., 2012; Bates et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2014; Lauvset et al., 2015; Wakita et al., 2017; Merlivat et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the  high agreement of pH decline among these available time-series studies leads to  high confidence in the trend of acidification in these zones. In the Arctic Ocean, a temporally limited time series of carbonate chemistry measurements prevents drawing robust conclusions on ocean acidification trends. However, the carbonate saturation state (Ω) is generally low, and observational studies show with robust evidence that the recent extensive melting of sea ice leading to enhanced air–sea CO2 exchange, large freshwater inputs, together with river discharge and glacial drainage, as well as the degradation of terrestrial organic matter in seawater, result in the decline of Ω of aragonite to undersaturation (Bates et al., 2009; Chierici and Fransson, 2009; Yamamoto-Kawai et al., 2009; Azetsu-Scott et al., 2010; Robbins et al., 2013; Fransson et al., 2015; Semiletov et al., 2016; Anderson et al., 2017; Qi et al., 2017; Beaupré-Laperrière et al., 2020; Y. Zhang et al., 2020; SROCCSection 3.2.1.2.4, IPCC, 2019b). The low saturation state of aragonite (Ω about 1) has also been observed in surface waters of the Antarctic coastal zone associated with freshwater input from glaciers (Mattsdotter Björk et al., 2014) and upwelling of deep water (Hauri et al., 2015) as well as along eastern boundary upwelling systems (Feely et al., 2016).Overall, in agreement with SROCC, it is virtually certain from these observational studies that ocean surface waters undergo acidification globally with the CO2 increase in the atmosphere. These sustained measurements over the past decades, and campaign studies of ocean carbonate chemistry, also highlight with robust evidence that trends of acidification have been modulated by the variability and changes in physical and chemical states of ocean, including those affected by the warming of the cryosphere, and need to be better understood.
