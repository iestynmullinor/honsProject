Ocean pH time series are based on the reconstruction of coral boron isotope ratios ( δ11B). A majority of coral δ11B data have been generated from the western Pacific region with a few records from the Atlantic Ocean. Biweekly resolution paleo-pH records show monsoonal variation of about 0.5 pH unit in the South China Sea (Liu et al., 2014). Interannual ocean pH variability in the range of 0.07–0.16 pH unit characterizes southwest Pacific corals that are attributed to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (H.C. Wu et al., 2018) and river runoff (D’Olivo et al., 2015). Decadal (10-, 22- and 48-year) ocean pH variations in the south-west Pacific have been linked to the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation, causing variations of up to 0.30 pH unit in the Great Barrier Reef (Pelejero et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2009) but weaker (about 0.08 pH unit) in the open ocean (H.C. Wu et al., 2018). Decadal variations in the South China Sea pH changes of 0.10–0.20 have also been associated with the variation in the East Asian monsoon (Liu et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2015), as a weakening of the Asian winter monsoon leads to sluggish water circulation within the reefs, building up localised CO2 concentration in the water due to calcification and respiration.Since the beginning of the industrial period in the mid-19th century, coral δ11B-derived ocean pH has decreased by 0.06–0.24 pH unit in the South China Sea (Liu et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2015) and 0.12 pH unit in the south-west Pacific (H.C. Wu et al., 2018). Since the mid-20th century, a distinct feature of coral δ11B records relates to ocean acidification trends, albeit having a wide range of values: 0.12–0.40 pH unit in the Great Barrier Reef (Wei et al., 2009; D’Olivo et al., 2015), 0.05–0.08 pH unit in the north-west Pacific (Shinjo et al., 2013) and 0.04–0.09 pH unit in the Atlantic Ocean (Goodkin et al., 2015; Fowell et al., 2018). Concurrent coral carbon isotopic ( δ13C) measurements infer ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 from the combustion of fossil fuel, based on the lower abundance of13C in fossil fuel carbon. Western Pacific coral records show depleted δ13C trends since the late 19th century that are more prominent since the mid-20th century (high confidence) (Pelejeroet al., 2005; Wei et al., 2009; Shinjo et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Kubota et al., 2017; H.C. Wu et al., 2018).Overall, many of the records show a highly variable seawater pH underlaying strong imprints of internal climate variability (high confidence) and, in most instances, superimposed on a decreasing δ11B trend that is indicative of anthropogenic ocean acidification in recent decades (medium confidence). The robustness of seawater pH reconstructions is currently limited by the uncertainty on the calibration of The  δ11B proxy in different tropical coral species.
