The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was an episode of global warming exceeding pre-industrial temperatures by 4°C–8°C (McInerney and Wing, 2011; Dunkley Jones et al., 2013) that occurred 55.9–55.7 Ma. The PETM involved a large pulse of geologic CO2 released into the ocean–atmosphere system in 3–20 kyr (Zeebe et al., 2016; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Kirtland Turner et al., 2017; Kirtland Turner, 2018; Gingerich, 2019; Section 5.2.1.1). In response, observationally constrained model simulations report an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations ranging from about 900 ppm to >2000 ppm (Chapter 2; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Cui and Schubert, 2018; Anagnostou et al., 2020). The PETM thus provides a test for our understanding of the ocean’s response to the increase in carbon (and heat) emissions over geologically short time scales.A limited number of independent proxy records indicate that the PETM was associated with a surface ocean pH decline ranging from 0.15 to 0.30 units (Penman et al., 2014; Gutjahr et al., 2017; Babila et al., 2018). It was also accompanied by a rapid (<10 ka) shallowing of the carbonate saturation horizon, resulting in the widespread dissolution of sedimentary carbonate, followed by a gradual (100 kyr) recovery (Zachos et al., 2005; Bralower et al., 2018). The remarkable similarity among sedimentary records spanning a wide range of ecosystems suggests with medium confidence that the perturbation in the ocean carbonate saturation was global (Babila et al., 2018) and directly resulted from elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. The degree of acidification is similar to the 0.4 pH unit decrease projected for the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5 (Gattuso et al., 2015) and is estimated to have occurred at a rate about one order of magnitude slower than the current rate of ocean acidification (Zeebe et al., 2016). There is low confidence in the inferred rates of ocean acidification inherent to the range of uncertainties affecting rates estimates based on marine sediments (Section 5.1.2.1).Recent model outputs and globally distributed geochemical data reveal with medium confidence widespread ocean deoxygenation during the PETM (Dickson et al., 2012, 2014; Winguth et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2018; Remmelzwaal et al., 2019), with parts of the ocean potentially becoming drastically oxygen-depleted (anoxic; Yao et al., 2018; Clarkson et al., 2021). Deoxygenation affected the surface ocean globally (including the Arctic Ocean; Sluijs et al., 2006), due to vertical and lateral expansion of OMZs (Zhou et al., 2014) that resulted from warming and related changes in ocean stratification. Expansion of OMZs may have stimulated N2O production through water-column (de)nitrification (Junium et al., 2018). The degree to which N2O production impacted PETM warming, however, has not yet been established.The feedbacks associated with recovery from the PETM are uncertain, yet could include drawdown associated with silicate weathering (Zachos et al., 2005) and regrowth of terrestrial and marine organic carbon stocks (Bowen and Zachos, 2010; Gutjahr et al., 2017).
