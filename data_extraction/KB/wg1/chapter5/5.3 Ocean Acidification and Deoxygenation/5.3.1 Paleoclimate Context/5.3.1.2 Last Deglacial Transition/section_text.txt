The Last Deglacial Transition (LDT) is the best documented climatic transition in the past associated with a substantial atmospheric CO2 rise ranging from 190 to 265 ppm between 18–11 ka (Marcott et al., 2014). The amplitude of the deglacial CO2 rise is thus on the same order of magnitude as the increase since the Industrial Revolution.Boron isotope ( δ11B) data suggest a 0.15–0.05 unit decrease in sea surface pH (Hönisch and Hemming, 2005; Henehan et al., 2013) across the LDT, an average rate of decline of about 0.002 units per century compared with the current rate of more than 0.1 units per century (Bopp et al., 2013; Gattuso et al., 2015). Planktonic foraminiferal shell weights decreased by 40% to 50% (Barker and Elderfield, 2002), and coccolith mass decreased by about 25% (Beaufort et al., 2011) across the LDT. Independent proxy reconstructions thus highlight with  high confidence that pH values decreased as atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased across the LDT. There is, however, low confidence in the inferred rate of ocean acidification owing to multiple sources of uncertainties affecting rates estimates based on marine sediments (Section 5.1.2.1).Geochemical and micropaleontological evidence suggest that intermediate-depth OMZs almost vanished during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (Jaccard et al., 2014). However, multiple lines of evidence suggest with medium confidence that the deep (>1500 m) ocean became depleted in O2 (concentrations were possibly lower than 50 μmol kg–1) globally (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Hoogakker et al., 2015, 2018; Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020a; Anderson et al., 2019) as a combined result of sluggish ventilation of the ocean subsurface (Gottschalk et al., 2016, 2020a; Skinner et al., 2017) and a generally more efficient marine biological carbon pump (Buchanan et al., 2016; Yamamoto et al., 2019; Galbraith and Skinner, 2020).During the LDT, deep ocean ventilation increased as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) (Skinner et al., 2010; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Jaccard et al., 2016) and subsequently the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (McManus et al., 2004; Lippold et al., 2016) resumed, transferring previously sequestered remineralized carbon from the ocean interior to the upper ocean, and eventually the atmosphere (Skinner et al., 2010; Galbraith and Jaccard, 2015; Gottschalk et al., 2016; Ronge et al., 2016, 2020; Sikes et al., 2016; Rae et al., 2018), contributing to the deglacial CO2 rise. Intermediate depths lost oxygen as a result of sluggish ventilation and increasing temperatures (decreasing saturation). As the world emerged from the last Glacial period, OMZs underwent a large volumetric increase at the beginning of the Bølling-Allerød (B/A), a northern-hemisphere wide warming event, 14.7 ka (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Praetorius et al., 2015) with deleterious consequences for benthic ecosystems (e.g., Moffitt et al., 2015). These observations indicate with  high confidence that the rate of warming, affecting the solubility of oxygen and upper water column stratification, coupled with changes in subsurface ocean ventilation, impose a direct control on the degree of ocean deoxygenation, implying a high sensitivity of ocean oxygen loss to warming. The expansion of OMZs contributed to a widespread increase in water column (de)nitrification (Galbraith and Kienast, 2013), which contributed substantially to enhanced marine N2O emissions. Nitrogen stable isotope measurements on N2O extracted from ice cores suggest that approximately one-third (of the order of 0.7 ± 0.3TgN yr–1) of thedeglacial increase in N2O emissions relates to oceanic sources (Schilt et al., 2014; H. Fischer et al., 2019).
