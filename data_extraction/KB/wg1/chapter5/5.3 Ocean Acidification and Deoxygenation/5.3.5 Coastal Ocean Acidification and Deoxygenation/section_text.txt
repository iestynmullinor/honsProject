There is  high agreement (robust evidence) that heterogeneity implies different responses of coastal regions to increasing atmospheric CO2, decreasing seawater pH and calcium carbonate saturation state, and deoxygenation (Duarte et al., 2013; Regnier et al., 2013; Breitburg et al., 2018; Laruelle et al., 2018; Carstensen and Duarte, 2019).There is  high agreement that long-time series of observations utilizing standard methods are needed to distinguish the climate change signal in seawater carbonate chemistry from the natural variability of coastal sites (Duarte et al., 2013; Salisbury and Jönsson, 2018; IOC, 2019; Sutton et al., 2019; Tilbrook et al., 2019; Turk et al., 2019). Despite the increasing availability of data and sea–air CO2 flux budgets for the coastal ocean (Sections 5.3.5.1 and 5.2.3.1), additional long-term observations are required to constrain the global time of emergence of coastal acidification. There is  high agreement (medium evidence) that, for the coastal subtropical to temperate north-east Pacific and north-west Atlantic, the mean time of emergence for acidification is above two decades (Sutton et al., 2019; Turk et al., 2019).Observations and models predict an expansion and intensification of low-pH deep water intrusions for the north-east Pacific coastal upwelling area (high agreement, robust evidence) (Hauri et al., 2013; Feely et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2020). Areas such as the California Current System are naturally exposed to intrusions of low‐pH, high pCO2sea deep waters from remineralization processes and anthropogenic CO2 intrusion (Feely et al., 2008, 2010, 2018; Chan et al., 2019; Lilly et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020).The eastern Pacific coastal upwelling displays seasonality in subsurface aragonite undersaturation as a consequence of the interplay between anthropogenic CO2, respiration and intrusion of upwelling waters (Feely et al., 2008, 2010, 2016, 2018; Hauri et al., 2013; Vargas et al., 2016; Chan et al., 2019; Lilly et al., 2019). The coastal south-east Pacific upwelling combined with low-pH, low-alkalinity, organic matter-rich river inputs display extreme temporal variability in surface seawaterpCO2 and low aragonite saturation (Vargas et al., 2016; Osma et al., 2020).Temperate, non-upwelling coastal areas along the north-west Atlantic display a trend of decreasing seawater pH, mainly attributed to the combined effects of eutrophication and decreasing seawater buffering capacity (high agreement, robust evidence). Observations show an increasing north to south gradient of aragonite saturation state (Sutton et al., 2016; Fennel et al., 2019; Cai et al., 2020). Low alkalinity and total inorganic carbon concentration, combined with an ocean signal of acidification, diminishes the buffering capacity along the decreasing salinity gradient from the ocean to the coast. Models suggest that, in this area, the aragonite saturation is seasonally controlled by nutrient availability and primary production, supporting the finding that eutrophication is the main driver for exacerbating acidification (Cai et al., 2017, 2020). The coastal Gulf of Mexico is facing a parallel increase in bottom water acidification and deoxygenation off the Mississippi Delta driven by eutrophication (Cai et al., 2011; Laurent et al., 2017; Fennel et al., 2019).Many coastal tropical areas are under heavy anthropogenic eutrophication induced by the effluents from large cities, or receive large riverine inputs of freshwater, nutrients, and organic matter (such as Amazon, Mississippi, Orinoco, Congo, Mekong, or Changjiang rivers). Under strong eutrophication, often sub-surface and bottom waters present pH values lower than average surface open ocean (about 8.0) because increased respiration decreases pH (high agreement, robust evidence), despite a net atmospheric CO2 sink in shallow and vertically stratified coastal areas (Koné et al., 2009; Wallace et al., 2014; Cotovicz Jr. et al., 2015, 2018; Fennel and Testa, 2019; Lowe et al., 2019; Section 5.3.5.1).There is medium evidence from observations and models that the coastal north-western Antarctic Peninsula (Southern Ocean) will experience calcium carbonate undersaturation by 2060, considering that anthropogenic emissions reach an atmospheric CO2 concentration of about 500 pm at that date (Lencina-Avila et al., 2018; Monteiro et al., 2020a). The synergies among warming, melt water, sea-air CO2 equilibrium and circulation may, to some extent, offset the coastal ocean acidification trends in Antarctica (Henley et al., 2020). In the coastal western Arctic Ocean, there is increasingrobust evidence that ocean acidification is driven by sea-air CO2 fluxes and sea-ice melt, and increasing intrusions since the 1990s of low-alkalinity Pacific water, lowering aragonite saturation state (Qi et al., 2017, 2020;  Cross et al., 2018). The Bering Sea (north-eastern Pacific) shows decreasing trends in calcium carbonate saturation, associated to the increasing atmospheric CO2 uptake combined with riverine freshwater and carbon inputs (high agreement, robust evidence) (Pilcher et al., 2019; H. Sun et al., 2020).The spatial distribution of hypoxic areas is highly heterogeneous in the coastal ocean, and there is  high agreement, robust evidence that more severe hypoxia or anoxia is often associated with highly populated coastal areas,or local circulation and upwelling, and seasonal stratification leading to an accumulation of organic matter in subsurface waters (Ciais et al., 2013; Rabalais et al., 2014; M. Li et al., 2016; Breitburg et al., 2018; Bindoff et al., 2019; SROCC Chapter 5). The causes and trends of coastal deoxygenation can only be assessed by making available long-term time series combined with regional modelling (Fennel and Testa, 2019), as in the California current system (Wang et al., 2017), the East China Sea (Chen et al., 2007; Qian et al., 2017), the Namibian or along the north-western Atlantic shelves (Claret et al., 2018). Other coastal upwelling sites such as the Arabian Sea display seasonal hypoxia but no worsening trends (Gupta et al., 2016).The Baltic Sea is the largest semi-enclosed sea where hypoxia is reported to have happened before the 1950s (Carstensen et al., 2014; Rabalais et al., 2014; Łukawska-Matuszewska et al., 2019). The frequency and volume of seawater inflow from the North Sea decreased after 1950, leading to an expansion of hypoxic areas from 40,000 to 60,000 km² in combination with increasing eutrophication (Carstensen et al., 2014). From the available observations, there is robust evidence that many areas in the Baltic Sea are experiencing deoxygenation despite efforts to reduce nutrient loads (Lennartz et al., 2014; Jokinen et al., 2018).There is medium agreement (medium evidence) that simply reducing anthropogenic nutrient inputs may lead to less severe coastal hypoxic conditions, as observed in the coastal north-western Adriatic Sea (Djakovac et al., 2015). However, low-oxygen sediments may remain a long-term source of phosphorus and ammonium to the water column, and in this way fuelling primary production (Jokinen et al., 2018; Fennel and Testa, 2019; Limburg et al., 2020).
