Run large-scale and long-term experiments and assessments to explore: the regional feasibility of CDR methods; whether they present an actual and verifiable negative regional carbon balance; and whether they result in adverse unintended consequences.Improve understanding of the effectiveness of CDR methods to lower atmospheric CO2 and reduce warming, taking into account Earth system feedbacks.
