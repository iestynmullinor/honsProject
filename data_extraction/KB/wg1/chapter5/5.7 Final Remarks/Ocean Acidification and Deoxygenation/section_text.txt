Improve observations for the interplay between carbonate chemistry and a variety of biogeochemical and physical processes, including eutrophication and freshwater inflow in coastal zones to increase the robustness of future assessments of ocean acidification.Improve our understanding of changes in water mass ventilation associated with climate change and variability to gain further insights into future trends in ocean acidification and deoxygenation in the ocean interior.
