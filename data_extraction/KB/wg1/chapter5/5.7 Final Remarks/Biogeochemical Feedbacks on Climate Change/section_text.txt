Improve understanding and representation in Earth system models of changes in land carbon storage and associated carbon–climate feedbacks including: better treatment of the CO2 fertilization, nutrient-limitations, soil organic matter stabilization and turnover; land-use change; large-scale and fine-scale permafrost carbon; plant growth, mortality, and competition dynamics; plant hydraulics; and disturbance processes.Improve observations and process understanding of CH4 and N2O source responses to climate, specifically from wetlands and permafrost thaw.Improve observations and process understanding of ocean N2O source responses to oxygen loss and climate, particularly in the oxygen minimum zones of the tropical oceans and eastern boundary upwelling regions.Improve understanding of the sensitivity of ocean carbon–climate feedbacks to physical processes that are not yet resolved by the ocean domain in ESMs.Improve understanding of the processes affecting the efficiency, climate sensitivity and emerging feedbacks in the ocean carbon cycle via the biological carbon pump to constrain future global ocean feedbacks.
