Further constrain the CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes from land use, land-use change and forestry (including gross fluxes), and fossil fuels. Improving spatial resolution and representations of land management, such as forestry, grazing and cropping.Improve representation of the variability and trends in the transport of carbon through the land–ocean continuum, which has implications for partitioning the land and ocean CO2 sinks.Improve understanding of the controls over the airborne franction and sinks rates, their trends, and future dynamics.Fill gaps in space and time for ocean CO2 and ancillary physical and biogeochemical observations at the ocean surface and interior to reduce the biases and uncertainties in the variability and trends for air–sea fluxes and inventory changes, particularly for the Arctic and the Southern Ocean.Reduce uncertainties of CH4 emissions from wetlands and inland waters, which are the largest source term in the global CH4 budget and proportionally have the largest uncertainty, to better understand future CH4-climate feedbacks.Reduce uncertainties in atmospheric transport models used to estimate regional sources and sinks of GHGs as independent evidence from that of ground and inventory estimates.
