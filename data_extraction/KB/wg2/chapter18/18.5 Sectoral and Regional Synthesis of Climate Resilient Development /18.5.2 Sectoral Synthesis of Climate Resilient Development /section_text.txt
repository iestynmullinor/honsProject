The sectoral chapters of the WGII report provide insights regarding how development processes interact with sectors to shape the potential for CRD. Similar to global regions, each sector is associated with various challenges, opportunities and options that enable or constrain CRD (Table 18.7). A number of challenges are common across sectors and mirror those associated with different regions. For example, issues associated with natural resource dependency, access to information for decision making, access to human and financial capital, and path dependence of institutions represent barriers that must be overcome if sectors are to support transitions that enable CRD. These challenges are more acute within vulnerable communities or nations where capacity to innovate and invest are constrained and social inequities reinforce the status quo (very high confidence). At the same time, a number of sector-specific opportunities for mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development can be used to integrate sectors into CRDPs. This could include policies and planning initiatives to enhance sector sustainability and resilience, as well as capacity building and greater inclusion of different actors and groups in decision making including capitalising on local and Indigenous knowledge as a mechanism for more representative and equitable action.In addition, the sectoral assessments identify a broad range of specific adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development options that could play a role in facilitating CRD. Many of these options appear initially to be specific to a given sector. For example, options for the water sector (Chapter 4) are assessed independently from those for health and well-being (Chapter 7). In practice, however, evidence suggests the importance of thinking about sectoral options as cross-cutting, mutually supportive and synergistic packages rather than singular options. First, each of the sectoral chapters has links to multiple SDGs (Table 18.7), implying each sector is important for achieving a range of sustainability goals that extend beyond sectoral boundaries. Moreover, progress across multiple sectors simultaneously creates opportunities for synergies for achieving the SDGs, but also enhances the risk of potential trade-offs (very high confidence). Second, a number of options are common to multiple sectors. For example, options associated with ecosystem-based adaptation and nature-based approaches to environmental management appear in multiple sectors (Table 18.7). Similarly, climate-smart agriculture and agroecological approaches to food systems create opportunities for food security, but those same options also benefit land-based ecosystems, water, poverty and livelihoods, and human well-being.Table 18.7 |  Sectoral synthesis of dimensions of climate resilient development. For each sectoral chapter of the WGII report, this table identifies those SDGs that are discussed in the relevant chapter as being particularly relevant to the sector. In addition, the table contains evidence of sustainable development challenges and opportunities as well as adaptation/sustainable development options and potential synergies and trade-offs associated with their implementation. Synergies and trade-offs are categorised as follows: (T) Trade-off among policies and practices; (S+) Synergy among policies and practices that enhances sustainability; (S-) Synergy among policies and practices that undermines sustainability.SectorRelevant SDGsChallengesOpportunitiesOptionsTrade-offsTerrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and their servicesSDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 6, SDG 7, SDG 9, SDG 10, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, SDG 15, SDG 17Low capacity for dispersal limits range shifts to match climate (Section 2.6.1)Constraints on the evolution of greater stress tolerance among species (Sections 2.4.2, 2.6.1)Altered peatland drainage and repeated disturbances pose barriers to restoration of tropical peatlands (Section 2.4.3)Demonstrating the efficacy of natural flood management efforts poses challenges to its deployment (Section 2.6.5)Uncertainties in climate and socioeconomic projections constrain adaptation planning and implementation (Section 2.7)Nature-based solutions offer the opportunity to address climate change and biodiversity problems in an integrated way (Section 2.6)Adaptation can be integrated with the protection of biodiversity and land-based climate change mitigation initiatives (Section 2.6.2)Habitat restoration, connectivity and creation of protected areas (Table 2.5)Integrated landscape management (Table Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL.1 in Chapter 2)Community-based natural resource management (Section 2.6.5.7)Maintain or restore natural species and structural diversity (Table Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL.1 in Chapter 2)Restoration of hydrological flows and catchment vegetation (Table Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL.1 in Chapter 2)Control of feral herbivores Table Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL.1 in Chapter 2)Reduce non-climatic stressors to land-based ecosystems (Table 2.6)(S+) ecosystem-based adaptation measures, such as restoration of forests and wetlands for flood and erosion control help maintain freshwater supply and quality (Section 2.2.2)(S-) over grazing/stocking of pastures and grasslands can result in soil erosion and the loss of biodiversity (Table Cross-Chapter BoxNATURAL1 in Chapter 2)(T) planting non-native monocultures for mitigation can reduce biodiversity and resilience(T) inappropriate hydrological restoration can result in increased methane emissions (Table Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL1 in Chapter 2)(T) afforestation/reforestation and bioenergy initiatives can conflict with other land uses such as food and timber production (Table Cross-Chapter Box BECCS, Section 2.2.2, Box 2.2)Ocean and coastal ecosystems and their servicesSDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 5, SDG 7, SDG 8, SDG 9, SDG 10, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, SDG 14Shifts in the distribution of fish species across exclusive economic zones present governance, ecological and conservation challenges (Section 3.4.3)Resource constraints impede the implementation of ecosystem-based and community-based adaptation for low- to middle-income nations (Section 3.6.2)Governance in marine social-ecological systems is highly complex with poorly defined legal frameworks (Section 3.6.2)‘Coastal squeeze’ challenges adaptation, creating tensions between coastal development and coastal habitat management (Section 3.6.3)Development assistance can help address resource constraints associated with marine ecosystem management (Section 3.6.3)Improving coordination among actors and projects will contribute to achieving SDGs (Section 3.6.3)Private finance can support restoration of blue carbon systems (Section 3.6.3)Joint implementation of coastal and marine management initiatives can address governance challenges across scales and sectors (Section 3.6.3)Ocean-based renewable energy options can reduce reliance on imported fuel (Section 3.6.3)Maritime spatial planning and integrated coastal management (Section 3.6.2;
