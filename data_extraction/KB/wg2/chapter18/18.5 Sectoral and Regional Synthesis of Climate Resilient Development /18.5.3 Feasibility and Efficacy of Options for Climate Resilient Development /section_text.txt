While both the sectoral and regional assessments indicate a rich toolkit of management options is available to decision makers to facilitate CRD, two key uncertainties undermine efforts to implement those options. The first is the feasibility of implementation. Options that seem promising could nevertheless encounter implementation barriers due to cost, absence of necessary capacity, lack of public acceptance or competition with alternative options. Progress in the literature since the AR5 and SR1.5 reports enables improved consideration for options feasibility for both mitigation (SR1.5 ref) and adaptation (Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB). This assessment allows the range of available options to be considered in a more critical light, particularly when considering opportunities for implementation over the near term. Meanwhile, the other challenge is that of option efficacy. Significant uncertainties remain regarding how well a given option will perform in a specific context and whether it is capable of adequately addressing risk (Section 18.6.1). Such uncertainties can undermine the pursuit of CRD or at least efforts to accelerate system transitions that support CRD (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Section 18.3). Accordingly, closer examination of option implementation in the real world, including within different sectoral and regional contexts, would enhance the knowledge available to decision makers regarding which options will best fit the needs of a given CRD pathway.
