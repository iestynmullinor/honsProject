Successfully implementing climate actions and managing trade-offs between mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development (Section 18.2.4) has important time considerations that imply significant urgency, making substantive progress in system transitions critical for CRD. Both the SDGs and the Sendai Framework, for example, have target dates of 2030. Meanwhile, the Paris Agreement sets specific time horizons for NDCs and the SR1.5 indicated that limiting warming to 1.5°C would similarly require substantial climate action by 2030 (IPCC, 2018a). While the literature is unambiguous regarding the need for significant system transitions to achieve CRD (Section 18.1.3), the current pace of global emissions reductions, poverty alleviation and development of equitable systems of governance is incommensurate with these policy time tables (Rogelj et al., 2010; Burke et al., 2016; Oleribe and Taylor-Robinson, 2016; Kriegler et al., 2018; Frank et al., 2019; Sadoff et al., 2020). As noted previously in the AR5, ‘delaying action in the present may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways in the future’ (Denton et al., 2014: 1123). Accordingly, significant acceleration in the pace of system transitions is necessary to enable the implementation of mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development initiatives consistent with CRD (very high confidence).Studies since the AR5 directly address the issue of how to accelerate transitions within the broader system transitions, sustainability transitions and socio-technical transitions literature (Frantzeskaki et al., 2017; Gliedt et al., 2018; Gorissen et al., 2018; Johnstone and Newell, 2018; Kuokkanen et al., 2019; Markard et al., 2020). Such literature explores several core themes to facilitate acceleration, which are aligned with the discussion later in this chapter on arenas of engagement for CRD (Section 18.4.3). One dominant theme is accelerating the implementation of sustainability or low-carbon policies that target specific sectors or industries (Bhamidipati et al., 2019). For example, Altenburg and Rodrik (Altenburg and Rodrik, 2017) discuss green industrial polices including taxes, mandated technology phase outs and the removal of subsidies as means of constraining polluting industries. Kivimaa et al. (Kivimaa and Martiskainen, 2018; Kivimaa et al., 2019a; Kivimaa et al., 2019b; Kivimaa et al., 2020) and Vihemäki et al. (2020) discuss low-carbon transitions in buildings, noting the important role that intermediaries play in facilitating policy reform. Nikulina et al. (2019) identify mechanisms for facilitating policy change in personal mobility including political leadership, combining carrots and sticks to incentivise behavioural change and challenging current policy frameworks. These various examples reflect a fragmented approach to system transitions, suggesting a large portfolio of such transition initiatives would be required to accelerate change or more fundamental and cross-cutting policy drivers are needed (high agreement , limited evidence). Policies that seek to promote social justice and equity, for example, could ultimately catalyse a broader range of sustainability and climate actions than policies designed to address a specific sector or class of technology (Delina and Sovacool, 2018 ; White, 2020).In contrast with formal government policies, a second theme in accelerating transitions is that of civic engagement (see also Section 18.4.3), which is reported to be an important opportunity for driving transitions forward (high agreement , medium evidence). Ehnert et al. (2018) describe local organisations and civic engagement in policy processes as an important engine for sustainability activities in European states. Similarly, Ruggiero et al. (2021) note the potential to use civic organisations to appeal to local identities in order to mobilise citizens to pursue energy transition initiatives among communities in the Baltic Sea region. Gernert et al. (2018) attribute such influence to the ability of grassroots movements to bypass traditional social and political norms and thereby experiment with new behaviours and processes. Moreover, civic engagement is also the foundation for collective action including protest and civil disobedience (Welch and Yates, 2018, Section 18.5.3.7). However, Haukkala (2018) observes that while green-transition coalitions in Finland could be an agent of change driving energy transitions, the diversity of views among the various grassroots actors could make consensus building difficult, thereby slowing transition initiatives.A third theme is that of innovation, generally, and sustainability-oriented innovation, specifically (de Vries et al., 2016; Geradts and Bocken, 2019; Loorbach et al., 2020), which creates opportunities for overcoming existing transition barriers (very high confidence). For example, Valta (2020) describes the role of innovation ecosystems—partnerships among companies, investors, governments and academics—in accelerating innovation (see also World Economic Forum, 2019). Burch et al. (Burch et al., 2016) describe the role of small- and medium-sized business entrepreneurship in promoting rapid innovation. Innovation extends beyond pure technology considerations to consider innovation in practices and social organisation (Li et al., 2018; Psaltoglou and Calle, 2018; Repo and Matschoss, 2020). Zivkovic (2018), for example, discusses ‘innovation labs’ as accelerators for addressing so-called wicked problems such as climate change through multi-stakeholder groups. Meanwhile, Chaminade and Randelli (2020) describe a case study where structural preconditions and place-based agency were important drivers of transitions to organic viticulture in Tuscany, Italy.The fourth theme is that of transition management (Goddard and Farrelly, 2018), particularly vis-à-vis, disruptive technologies (Iñigo and Albareda, 2016; Kuokkanen et al., 2019) or broader societal disruptions (Brundiers, 2020; Davidsson, 2020; Hepburn et al., 2020; Schipper et al., 2020b). Recent literature has given attention to how actors can use disruptive events, such as disasters, as a window of opportunity for accelerating changes in policies, practices and behaviours (high agreement , medium evidence) (Brundiers, 2018; Brundiers and Eakin, 2018). This is consistent with concepts in resilience thinking around ‘building back better’ after disasters (Fernandez and Ahmed, 2019). For example, Hepburn et al. discuss fiscal recovery packages for COVID-19 as a means of accelerating climate action, with a particular influence on clean physical infrastructure, building efficiency retrofits, investment in education and training, natural capital investment, and clean research and development (Andrijevic et al., 2020b).Table 18.2 | Emissions pathway regional characteristics from WGIII scenarios database for pathways associated with different global warming levels (1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C).
