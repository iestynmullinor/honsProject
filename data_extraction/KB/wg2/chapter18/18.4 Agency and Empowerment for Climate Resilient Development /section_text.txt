Climate finance broadly refers to resources that catalyse low-carbon and climate resilient development. It covers the costs and risks of climate action, supports an enabling environment and capacity for adaptation and mitigation, and encourages research and development (R&D) and deployment of new technologies. Climate finance can be mobilised through a range of instruments from a variety of sources, international and domestic, public and private (Section 18.4.2.2).The private sector has particular competencies which can make significant contributions to adaptation, through innovative technology, design of resilient infrastructure, development and implementation of improved information systems, and the management of major projects. The private sector can be seen as a ‘supplier of innovative goods and services’ to meet the adaptation priorities of developing countries with expertise in technology and service delivery (Biagini and Miller, 2013).Future investment opportunities in climate resilient development (CRD) are in water resources, agriculture and environmental services. Provision of clean water is another opportunity, requiring investment in water purification and treatment technologies such as desalination and wastewater treatment. Weather and climate services are a possible area for private investment. (Hov et al., 2017; Hewitt et al., 2020).
