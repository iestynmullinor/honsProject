An overarching enabling condition for achieving system transitions and transformations is the presence of enabling governance systems (very high confidence). Recent literature on the translation of governance into system transitions in practice suggests four key actions are important. The first is the critical reflection on so-called ‘development solutions’, alternatively framed by some as ‘empty promises’, that worsen climate risk, inequity, injustice and ultimately lead to unsustainable development (Mikulewicz, 2018; Mikulewicz and Taylor, 2020). Examples include development aid (Scoville-Simonds et al., 2020), large-scale development projects such as biofuel production in Ethiopia (Tufa et al., 2018) and urban growth management in Vietnam (DiGregorio, 2015). The second is the recognition that while the power of different actors and institutions is often tied to access to resources and the ability to constrain the actions of others, other dimensions of power such as its ability to produce knowledge as well as its contingency on circumstances and relationships are also important in enabling energy transitions (Avelino et al., 2016; Avelino and Wittmayer, 2016; Lockwood et al., 2016; Ahlborg, 2017; Avelino and Grin, 2017; Partzsch, 2017; Smith and Stirling, 2018). Third, governance systems can help to develop productive interactions between formal government institutions, the private sector and civil society including the provision ‘safe arenas’ for social actors to deliberate and pursue transitional and transformational change (Haukkala, 2018; Törnberg, 2018; Strazds; Ferragina et al., 2020; Koch, 2020) (Section 18.3.1, Box 18.1). Fourth, governance can address challenges such as climate change from a systems perspective and pursue interventions that address the interactions among development, climate change, equity and justice, and planetary health (Harvey et al., 2019; Hölscher et al., 2019). This is evidenced by recent experience with the COVID-19 pandemic response as well as ongoing escalation of disaster risk associated with extreme weather events (Walch, 2019; Cohen, 2020; Schipper et al., 2020b; Wells et al., 2020).One output from systems of governance is formal policy frameworks and policies that influence processes and outcomes of system transitions that support CRD (Section 18.1.3). The Paris Agreement, for example, provides a framework for CRD by defining a mitigation-centric goal of ‘limiting warming to well below 2°C and enabling a transition to 1.5°C’ (UNFCCC, 2015). It also provides for a broadly defined global adaptation goal (UNFCCC, 2015: Art. 7.1). The NDCs are the core mechanism for achieving and enhancing climate ambitions under the Paris Agreement. However, the pursuit of a given NDC within a specific country will likely necessitate a range of other policy interventions that have more immediate impact on technologies and behaviour, implicating transitions in energy, industry, land and infrastructure (very high confidence) (Section 18.3.1). SDG-relevant activities are increasingly incorporated into climate commitments in the NDCs (at last count 94 NDCs also addressed SDGs), contributing to several (154 out of the 169) SDG targets (Brandi and Dzebo; Pauw et al., 2018). This reflects the potential of the NDCs as near-term policy instruments and signposts for progress towards CRD (medium agreement , limited evidence) (McCollum et al., 2018b).As reflected by the SDGs (and SDG 13 specifically), the mainstreaming of climate change concerns into development policies is one mechanism for pursuing sustainable development and CRD (very high confidence). However, such mainstreaming has also been critiqued for perpetuating ‘development as usual’, reinforcing established development logics, structures and worldviews that are themselves contributing to climate change and vulnerability (O’Brien et al., 2015) and for obscuring and depoliticising adaptation choices into technocratic choices (Murtinho, 2016; Webber and Donner, 2017; Benjaminsen and Kaarhus, 2018; Khatri, 2018; Scoville-Simonds et al., 2020). The coordinated implementation of sustainable development policy and climate action is nonetheless crucial for ensuring that the attainment of one does not come at the expense of others (Stafford-Smith et al., 2017). For example, aggressive pursuit of climate policies that facilitate transitions in energy systems can undermine efforts to secure sustainability transitions in other systems (Sections 18.3.1.1, 18.2.5.3, Table 18.7).Several non-climate international policy agreements provide context for CRD such as the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (Hjerpe et al., 2015) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD; UNFCCC, 1992), the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UN, 1994), as well as the more recent Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR, 2015) and the ‘new humanitarianisms’ which seeks to reduce the gap between emergency assistance and longer term development (Marin and Naess, 2017). Collectively they provide a global policy framework that protects people’s rights that are potentially threatened by climate change (Olsson et al., 2014). These policies are relevant to transitions across multiple systems, particularly in societal systems towards more equitable and just development.
