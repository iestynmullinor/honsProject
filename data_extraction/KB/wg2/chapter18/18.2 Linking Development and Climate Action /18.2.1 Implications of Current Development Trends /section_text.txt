Understanding the interactions between climate change, climate action and sustainable development necessitates consideration for the current development context in which different communities, nations and regions find themselves. For example, wealthy economies of the Global North will encounter different opportunities and challenges vis-à-vis climate change and sustainable development than developing economies of the Global South. Moreover, all economies are already following an existing development trajectory that has implications for the type and scale of interventions associated with pursuing CRD and managing climate risk. Some nations may experience particular challenges with reducing greenhouse gas emissions owing to the carbon-intensive nature of their energy systems (very high confidence) (Section 18.3.1.1). Others may experience acute challenges with adaptation due to existing vulnerability associated with poverty and social inequality (very high confidence) (Section 18.2.5.1). Overcoming such challenges is fundamental to the pursuit of CRD.While demonstrable progress has been made towards the SDGs and improving human well-being, globally and in specific nations, some observed patterns of development are inconsistent with sustainable development and the principles of CRD (very high confidence) (van Dooren et al., 2018; Eisenmenger et al., 2020; Leal Filho et al., 2020). A significant literature, for example, links development to the loss of biodiversity and the extinction crisis (Ceballos et al., 2017; Gonçalves-Souza et al., 2020; Oke et al., 2021). Meanwhile, in human systems, indicators such as the limited convergence in income, life expectancy and other measures of well-being between poor and wealthy countries (with notable outliers such as China) (Bangura, 2019), and the increase in income inequality and the decline in life expectancy and well-being in rich countries (Rougoor and van Marrewijk, 2015; Alvaredo et al., 2017; Goda et al., 2017; Harper et al., 2017; Goldman et al., 2018), suggest limitations of the current development paradigm to successfully deliver universal human and ecological well-being by the 2030s or even mid-century (TWI, 2019).
