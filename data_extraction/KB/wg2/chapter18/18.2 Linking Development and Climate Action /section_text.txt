The achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represents near-term positive sustainability as well as indicating the quality of development processes and actions (inclusion and social justice, alternative development models, planetary health, well-being, equity, solidary, different forms of knowledge and human–nature connectivity) that enable climate resilient development (CRD) in the long term (Sections 18.2.2.2, 18.2.5.3). A key question is the extent to which adaptation actions (or non-action) may contribute to (or undermine) SDG achievement and, in particular, shift the quality of development processes and engagement within the political, economic, ecological, socio-ethical and knowledge-technology arenas, and hence contribute to climate resilient development pathways (CRDPs).Table Box 18.4.1 (below) provides a set of examples of how adaptation actions can either contribute to or undermine SDG achievement for SDGs 2, 3, 6, 11 and 16. In general, formal adaptation policies as well as household and community-based adaptation strategies can generate positive outcomes, particularly if they are responsive to the local context and needs, with real participation and leadership by target populations (Remling and Veitayaki, 2016; Buckwell et al., 2020; McNamara et al., 2020; Owen, 2020). For example, integrated adaptation approaches to the water–energy–food (WEF) nexus aiming to build resilience in those sectors can lead to increased resource use efficiency and coherent strategies for managing the complex interactions and trade-offs among the water, energy and food SDGs (Mpandeli et al., 2018; Nhamo et al., 2020). One such approach could involve cultivating indigenous crops suited to harsh growing conditions, which would allow for agricultural expansion for food and energy without increased water withdrawals (Mpandeli et al., 2018). Overall, adaptation commitments aiming to build resilience of vulnerable populations have typically shown to contribute to SDGs focused on ending extreme poverty (SDG 1), improving food security (SDG 2), improving access to water (SDG 6), ensuring clean energy (SDG 7), tackling climate change (SDG 13) and halting land degradation and deforestation (SDG 15) (Antwi-Agyei et al., 2018).However, evidence also suggests limitations of adaptation actions, with the objectives and actions often being too narrow to address social justice and enable CRD. As such, adaptation actions can sometimes undermine SDG achievement through exacerbating social vulnerability, inequity and uneven power relations (Antwi-Agyei et al., 2018; Atteridge and Remling, 2018; Paprocki, 2018; Mikulewicz, 2019; Satyal et al., 2020; Scoville-Simonds et al., 2020). This is due to adaptation practices often not accounting for the differentiated ways in which minority groups are especially vulnerable. For example, designs of emergency shelters should consider the fear of social stigma or abuse faced by women and girls (Pelling and Garschagen, 2019).Box 18.4Such maladaptive adaptation practices can undermine SDG achievement through increasing vulnerability of marginalised groups by failing to address the underlying root causes of vulnerability and poverty that are related to political economy, power dynamics and vested interests more broadly, instead treating the symptoms as the cause (Magnan et al., 2016; Ajibade and Egge, 2019; Schipper, 2020). For example, evidence exists of flood defence measures through large-scale infrastructure development leading to the violent displacement of poor communities, forcibly resettling people in areas far from their employment or pushing up land and housing costs without providing compensation (Fuso Nerini et al., 2018; Reckien et al., 2018). Moreover, sectoral approaches to adaptation that fail to acknowledge the linkages between SDGs can counter development efforts and generate further trade-offs (Terry, 2009; Rasul and Sharma, 2016; von Stechow et al., 2016; Klinsky et al., 2017; Hallegatte et al., 2019).The literature recommends a set of strategies for ensuring that adaptation actions are aligned with SDG achievement and do not further perpetuate poverty and inequality. These include ensuring that marginalised voices are central to adaptation decision making, with participatory approaches that empower and compensate affected communities (Moser and Ekstrom, 2011; Broto et al., 2015; Pelling and Garschagen, 2019; Palermo and Hernandez, 2020). Gender mainstreaming and gender transformative approaches within climate policies can also help ensure gender-sensitive design of adaptation projects, with appropriate equity analyses of policy (Klinsky et al., 2017) decisions to identify the actual implications of trade-offs for vulnerable groups (Beuchelt and Badstue, 2013; Alston, 2014; Bowen et al., 2017; Fuso Nerini et al., 2018).In addition, a substantial literature also argues for policy coherence measures that adopt whole-of-government approaches and mainstream and nationalise SDG targets within national climate policies (Nilsson et al., 2012; Le Blanc, 2015; Ari, 2017; Collste et al., 2017; Dzebo et al., 2017; Nilsson and Weitz, 2019). Institutional coordination mechanisms that aim to break down silos between different agencies and actors at the national level are suggested as beneficial for avoiding trade-offs between adaptation actions and SDGs (Mirzabaev et al., 2015; Howlett and Saguin, 2018; Scherer et al., 2018). However, these need to be paired with an investigation of the deep-seated ideologies and vested interests that are creating goal conflicts and negatively impacting marginalised groups to begin with (Purdon, 2014; Bocquillon, 2018). Ultimately, adaptation measures need to acknowledge and address the underlying drivers that make certain groups particularly vulnerable, such as social disenfranchisement, unequal power dynamics and historical legacies of colonialism and exploitation (Magnan et al., 2016; Schipper, 2020)Table Box 18.4.1 | Examples of linkages between adaptation and the SDGs. For several key SDGs aligned with the concept of CRD, the table below identifies evidence from the literature where adaptation policies and practices contribute to achievement of the SDG, as well as where they undermine achievement of the SDG.SDGEvidence of adaptation contributing to SDGEvidence of adaptation undermining SDGSDG 2: Zero HungerAdaptation measures implemented by smallholder farmers (e.g., adjustments in farm operations timing, on-farm diversification, soil–water management) exhibit higher levels of productivity and technical efficiency in food production (Bai et al., 2019; Sloat et al., 2020; Khanal et al., 2021)Some climate smart agriculture measures (e.g., intercropping) can significantly increase yields and contribute to zero hunger (Lipper et al., 2014; Arslan et al., 2015; Saj et al., 2017)Some adaptation policies can increase land and food prices, negatively impacting smallholder farmers (Fuso Nerini et al., 2018; Zavaleta et al., 2018; Albizua et al., 2019)Potential trade-offs for food production through adaptation actions within the water or energy sector, if integrated approaches not taken (Howells et al., 2013; FAO, 2014; Biswas and Tortajada, 2016)SDG 3: Good Health and WellbeingIncreased resilience of societies and reduced vulnerability through investments in public health care and access (Marmot, 2020; Mullins and White, 2020 )Adaptation measures that leverage solidarity, equity and nature connectedness contribute to physical and psychological health and well-being (Gambrel and Cafaro, 2009; Capaldi et al., 2015; Soga and Gaston, 2016; Woiwode, 2020)Societal measures beyond adaptation required to address underlying causes of inequities that drive poor health and well-being, including cuts in public spending and neoliberalisation and commodification of healthcare (Hall, 2020; Walsh and Dillard-Wright, 2020)SDG 6: Clean Water and SanitationIntegrated water resources management as an adaptation strategy (Tan and Foo, 2018; Sadoff et al., 2020)Potential trade-offs for water security through adaptation actions within the food or energy sector, if integrated approaches not taken (Howells et al., 2013; Rasul and Sharma, 2016; Mpandeli et al., 2018)Local, regional or national ‘grabs’ for water from shared resources with poorly defined property rights (Olmstead, 2014)SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and CommunitiesVulnerability reducing adaptation measures that aim to upgrade informal settlements, create affordable housing and protect populations living in disaster prone areas (Major et al., 2018; Sanchez Rodriguez et al., 2018; Ajibade and Egge, 2019)Need to ensure that adaptation measures understand how power dynamics and cultural norms shape urban form and communities’ vulnerability and adaptive capacity (Sanchez Rodriguez et al., 2018)Risk of built infrastructure aiming to increase resilience ignoring local population needs and creating low-skilled jobs that concentrate land, capital and resources in the hands of the elite (Ajibade and Egge, 2019)SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong InstitutionsPotential for adaptation projects to support livelihood incomes and resource management, and thereby reduce tensions and the risk of conflicts (Matthew, 2014; Dresse et al., 2018; Barnett, 2019)Studies from Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal found that climate change adaptation-related policies and projects were an underlying cause of natural resource-based conflicts, as well as land dispossession and exclusion, entrenchment of dependency relations, elite capture and inequity (Sovacool, 2018; Sultana et al., 2019)Adaptation projects can reinforce top-down knowledge and decision-making processes, asymmetric power relations and elite capture of adaptation resources (Nightingale, 2017; Eriksen et al., 2021b)Need for conflict-sensitive adaptation approaches that aim to ‘do no harm’ (Babcicky, 2013; Ide, 2020)
