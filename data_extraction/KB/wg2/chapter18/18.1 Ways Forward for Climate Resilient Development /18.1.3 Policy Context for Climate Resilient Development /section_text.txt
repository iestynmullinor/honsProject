As reflected in Chapter 1 of the AR6 WGII report, CRD is emerging as one of the guiding principles for climate policy, both at the international level (Denton et al., 2014; Segger, 2016), as reflected in the Paris Agreement (Article 2, UNFCCC, 2015), and within specific countries (Simonet and Jobbins, 2016; Kim et al., 2017b; Vincent and Colenbrander, 2018; Yalew, 2020). This framing of development recognises the risks posed by climate change to development objectives (Section 18.2; see also Chapter 16); the opportunities, constraints and limits associated with reducing risk through adaptation; synergies and trade-offs between mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development (Sections 18.2.5, 18.5, Box 18.4); and the role of system transitions in enabling large-scale transformations that limit future global warming to less than 1.5°C, while boosting resilience (IPCC, 2018a) (Section 18.3, Box 18.1).Since the AR5, the volume of research at the nexus of climate action and sustainable development has changed markedly (very high confidence). A rapidly growing, multi-disciplinary literature has emerged on CRD (Mitchell et al., 2015; Clapp and Sillmann, 2019; Hardoy et al., 2019; Yalew, 2020) and associated pathways (Naess et al., 2015; Winkler and Dubash, 2016; Brechin and Espinoza, 2017; Solecki et al., 2017; Ellis and Tschakert, 2019) (Section 18.2.2). Nevertheless, the concept of resilience generally, and CRD specifically, has come under increasing criticism in recent years (very high confidence) (Joakim et al., 2015; Schlosberg et al., 2017; Mikulewicz, 2018; Mikulewicz, 2019; Moser et al., 2019), suggesting the need to enhance understanding of how resilience is being operationalised at the programme and project level and the net implications for human and ecological well-being.This expansion of research has been accompanied by a shift in the policy context for climate action including an increasingly strong link between climate actions and sustainable development. In particular, the SDGs represent a near-term framework linking sustainability and human development in a manner that not only addresses planetary health and human well-being, but also help better plan and implement mitigation and adaptation actions to achieve these linked goals (Conway et al., 2015; Griscom et al., 2017; Allen et al., 2018b; Roy et al., 2018; P.R. Shukla E. Calvo Buendia, 2019). The SDGs explicitly identify climate action (SDG 13) among the goals needed to achieve sustainable development. Meanwhile, the text of the Paris Agreement makes explicit mention of the importance of considering climate ‘in the context of sustainable development’ (Articles 2, 4, 6) or as ‘contributing to sustainable development’ (Article 7) (Article 7, UNFCCC, 2015). Similarly, sustainable development appears prominently within the text of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR, 2015) and the Global Assessment Reports on Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR, 2019). At the local- or household-level, a growing literature recognises that climate impacts tend to exacerbate existing inequalities within societies, even at the level of gender inequalities within households (Sultana, 2010; Arora-Jonsson, 2011; Carr, 2013). Thus, climate change impacts threaten even short-term gains in sustainable development (18.2, Box 18.4), which could be rolled back over longer adaptation and mitigation horizons. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to have reversed gains over the past several years in terms of global poverty reduction (very high confidence) (Phillips et al., 2020; Sultana, 2021; Wilhelmi et al., 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7), reflecting the risks posed by global, systemic threats to development.The WGII AR5 Report noted that adapting to the risks associated with climate change becomes more challenging at higher levels of global warming (IPCC, 2014a). This was evidenced by contrasting impacts and adaptive capacity for 2°C and 4°C of warming. This relationship between levels of warming, climate risk and reasons for concern (see Chapter 16) is also relevant to the concept of CRD. For example, recent literature on CRD emphasises the urgency of climate action that achieve significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the implementation of adaptation options that result in significant gains in human and natural system resilience (very high confidence) (Haines et al., 2017; Shindell et al., 2017; Xu and Ramanathan, 2017; Fuso Nerini et al., 2018). This was explored extensively in the IPCC’s SR1.5 report in its comparison of impacts associated with 1.5°C versus 2°C climate objectives and synergies and trade-offs with the SDGs (IPCC, 2018a). However, the SR1.5 report and other literature also identified potential trade-offs between aggressive mitigation and the SDGs (see also Frank et al., 2017; Hasegawa et al., 2018). This indicates that while future magnitudes of warming are a fundamental consideration in CRD, such development involves more than just achieving temperature targets. Rather, CRD considers the possible transitions that enable those targets to be achieved, including the evaluation of different adaptation and mitigation options and how the implementation of these strategies interacts with broader sustainable development efforts and goals. This interdependence between patterns of development, climate risk and the demand for mitigation and adaptation action is fundamental to the concept of CRD (Fankhauser and McDermott, 2016). Therefore, climate change and sustainable development cannot be assessed or planned in isolation of one another.
