The number of assessable peer-reviewed studies that make connections between climate-related migration and health and well-being is small. The health outcomes of migrants generally, and of climate-migrants in particular, vary according to geographical context, country and the particular circumstances of migration or immobility (Hunter and Simon, 2017; Hunter et al., 2021; Schwerdtle et al., 2020). Such linkages are ‘multi-directional’, with studies suggesting that healthy individuals may be more likely to migrate internationally in search of economic opportunities than people in poorer health, except during adverse climatic conditions when migration rates may change across all groups, and that migrants may have different long-term health outcomes than people born in destination areas, potentially displaying a range of positive and negative health outcomes compared to non-migrants (Kennedy et al., 2015; Dodd et al., 2017; Hunter and Simon, 2017; Riosmena et al., 2017). Refugees and other involuntary migrants often experience higher exposure to disease and malnutrition, adverse indirect health effects of changes in diet or activity and increased rates of mental health concerns. These latter may be attributable to a sense of loss or fear (Schwerdtle et al., 2018; Torres and Casey, 2017) as well as due to the interruption of healthcare; occupational injuries; sleep deprivation; non-hygienic lodgings and insufficient sanitary facilities; heightened exposure to vector- and WBDs; vulnerability to psychosocial, sexual and reproductive issues; behavioural disorders; substance abuse; and violence (Farhat et al., 2018; Wickramage et al., 2018) (high confidence). Linkages between climate migration and the spread of infectious disease are bidirectional; migrants may be exposed to diseases at the destination to which they have lower immunity than the host community; in other cases, migrants could introduce diseases to the receiving community (McMichael, 2015). Thus, receiving areas may have to pay greater attention to building migrant sensitive health systems and services (Hunter and Simon, 2017). The risk of migration leading to disease transmission is exacerbated by weak governance and lack of policy to support public health measures and access to medicines (Pottie et al., 2015).
