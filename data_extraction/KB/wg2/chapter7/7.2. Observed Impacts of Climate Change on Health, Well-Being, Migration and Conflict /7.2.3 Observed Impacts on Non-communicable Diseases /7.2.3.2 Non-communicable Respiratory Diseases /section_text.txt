Lung diseases, including asthma, COPD and lung cancer, comprise the largest subsets of non-communicable pulmonary disease (Ferkol and Schraufnagel, 2014). Overall, the global burden of non-communicable lung disease including all chronic lung disease and lung cancer is substantial, being responsible for 10.6% of deaths and 5.9% of DALYs globally in 2019 (Vos et al., 2020).Several non-communicable respiratory diseases are climate sensitive based on their exposure pathways (very high confidence). Multiple exposure pathways contribute to non-communicable respiratory disease (Deng et al., 2020), some of which are climate-related (Rice et al., 2014), including mobilisation and transport of dust (Schweitzer et al., 2018); changes in concentrations of air pollutants such as small particulates (PM2.5) and ozone formed by photochemical reactions sensitive to temperature (Hansel et al., 2016); increased wildland fires and related smoke exposure (Johnston et al., 2002; Reid et al., 2016); increased exposure to ambient heat driving reduced lung function and exacerbations of chronic lung disease (Collaco et al., 2018; Jehn et al., 2013; McCormack et al., 2016; Witt et al., 2015) and modification of aeroallergen production and duration of exposure (Ziska et al., 2019).Burdens of allergic disease, particularly allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma may be changing in response to climate change (medium confidence)  (Dâ€™Amato et al., 2020; Eguiluz-Gracia et al., 2020; Deng et al., 2020; Demain, 2018). This is supported by evidence showing an increase in the length of the North American pollen season attributable to climate change (Ziska et al., 2019), an association between timing of spring onset and higher asthma hospitalisations presumed to be due to higher pollen exposure (Sapkota et al., 2020) and other evidence linking aeroallergen exposure with a worsening burden of allergic disease (Demain, 2018; Poole et al., 2019).
