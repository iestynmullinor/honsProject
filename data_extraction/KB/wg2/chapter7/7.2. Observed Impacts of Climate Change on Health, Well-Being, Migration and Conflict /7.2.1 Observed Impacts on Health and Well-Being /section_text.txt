Eleven categories of diseases and health outcomes have been identified in this assessment as being climate-sensitive through direct pathways (e.g., heat and floods) and indirect pathways mediated through natural and human systems and economic and social disruptions (e.g., disease vectors, allergens, air and water pollution, and food system disruption) (high confidence). A key challenge in quantifying the specific relationship between climate and health outcomes is distinguishing the extent to which observed changes in prevalence of a climate-sensitive disease or condition are attributable directly or indirectly to climatic factors as opposed to other non-climatic causal factors (Ebi et al., 2020). A subsequent challenge is then determining the extent to which those observed changes in health outcomes associated with climate are attributable to events or conditions associated with natural climate variability compared to persistent human induced shifts in the mean and/or the variability characteristics of climate (i.e., anthropogenic climate change). The context within which the impacts of climate change affect health outcomes and health systems is described in this chapter as being a function of risk, which is in turn a product of interactions between hazard, exposure and vulnerability (Chapter 1), with the impacts in turn having the potential to reinforce vulnerability and/or exposure to risk (Figure 7.4).Figure 7.4 | Interactions between hazard, exposure and vulnerability that generate impacts on health systems and outcomes, with selected examples.
