Structural inequalities play out at an individual level to create gendered experiences of violence (high agreement, medium evidence). Violent conflict is experienced differently by men and women because of gender norms that already exist in society and shape vulnerabilities. For example, conflict deepens gendered vulnerabilities to climate change related to unequal access to land and livelihood opportunities (Chandra et al., 2017). Motivations for inter-group violence may be influenced by constructions of masculinity, for example the responsibility to secure their family’s survival or pay dowries (Myrttinen et al., 2017), and gendered roles may incentivise young men to protest or to join non-state armed groups during periods of adverse climate (Myrttinen et al., 2015; Myrttinen et al., 2017; Anwar et al., 2019; Hendrix and Haggard, 2015; Koren and Bagozzi, 2017). Research has found a positive correlation between crop failures and suicides by male farmers who could not adapt their livelihoods to rising temperatures (Bryant and Garnham 2015; Kennedy and King, 2014; Carleton, 2017).Extreme weather and climate impacts are associated with increased violence against women, girls and vulnerable groups (high agreement, medium evidence). During and after extreme weather events, women, girls and LGBTQI people are at increased risk of domestic violence, harassment, sexual violence and trafficking (Le Masson et al., 2019; Nguyen, 2019;Myrttinen et al., 2015; Chindarkar, 2012). For example, early marriage is used as a coping strategy for managing the effects of extreme weather events (Ahmed et al., 2019) and women are exposed to increase risk of harassment and sexual assault as scarcity and gender-based roles cause them to walk longer distances to fetch water and fuel (Le Masson et al., 2019). Within the household, violent backlash or heightened tensions may arise from changing gender norms as men migrate to find work in post-disaster settings (Stork et al., 2015) and men’s use of negative coping mechanisms, such as alcoholism, when unable to meet norms of providing for the household (Anwar et al., 2019; Stork et al., 2015). Rates of intimate partner violence have been found to increase with higher temperatures (Sanz-Barbero et al., 2018).
