Maternal and neonatal disorders accounted for 3.7% of total global deaths and 7.8% of global DALYs in 2019 (Vos et al., 2020). Children and pregnant women have potentially higher rates of vulnerability and/or exposure to climatic hazards, extreme weather events and undernutrition (Garcia and Sheehan, 2016; Sorensen et al., 2018; Chersich et al., 2018). Available evidence suggests that heat is associated with higher rates of pre-term birth (Wang et al., 2020), low birthweight, stillbirth, neonatal stress (Cil and Cameron, 2017; Kuehn and McCormick, 2017) and adverse child health (Kuehn and McCormick, 2017). Extreme weather events are associated with reduced access to prenatal care, unattended deliveries (Abdullah et al., 2019) and decreased paediatric healthcare access (Haque et al., 2019).
