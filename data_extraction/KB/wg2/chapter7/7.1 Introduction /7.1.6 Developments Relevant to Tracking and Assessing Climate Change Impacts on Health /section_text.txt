Since AR5, there has been a steady increase in standardised, globally scoped, data-driven health impact assessments, such as the ongoing Global Burden of Disease study (James et al., 2018) that now includes scenario-based projections (Foreman et al., 2018), that make linkages with other global priorities, including the SDGs (Fullman et al., 2017). Attention has turned from prioritising specific diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, to strengthening health systems and providing universal health coverage (Chang et al., 2019), with an ongoing emphasis on the social determinants of health. Several climate-sensitive health outcomes are now tracked in the annual Lancet Countdown reports (Watts et al., 2015; Watts et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2018b; Watts et al., 2019; Watts et al., 2021). The Global Burden of Disease study is beginning to examine climate-sensitive disease burdens, incorporate temperature as a risk factor (Murray et al., 2020) and project future cause-specific disease burdens in a warming world (Burkart et al., 2021). Although not assessed in this chapter, there are numerous ongoing assessments of climate change impacts on health and well-being being undertaken by national and local health authorities that continue to generate insights into climate-related health impacts and suggest response options relevant for decision makers.While the knowledge base regarding global health has increased, a comprehensive framework is not in place that fully integrates health, well-being and environmental impacts from climate change allowing for the cumulative assessment of their impact. Moreover, significant cracks in the foundation of global health governance that affect preparedness and adaptive capacity for climate change, among other threats, have been identified (Phelan et al., 2020; Defor and Oheneba-Dornyo, 2020; Ostergard et al., 2020; Shaffie, 2021). While attention to climate change and health has increased and there is evidence of increasing adaptation activity in the health sector (Watts et al., 2019), there is also continued evidence of substantial adaptation gaps (UNEP, 2018; UNEP, 2021) including gaps in humanitarian response capacity for climate-related disasters (Watts et al., 2021) that appear to be widening as adverse climate change impacts on health and well-being accrue.
