AR5 stated with very high confidence that the health of human populations is sensitive to climate change (Smith et al., 2014). Specific observations of current impacts included the expansion of the geographical ranges of some diseases into previously unaffected areas and changes in the distributions of some food-, water- and vector-borne diseases  (high confidence). Increasing future health risks were projected from injury, disease and death due to more intense heatwaves and fires  (very high confidence)  , undernutrition in poor regions  (high confidence)  , food- and waterborne diseases  (very high confidence)  and VBDs  (medium confidence). AR5 found that climate change is a multiplier of existing health vulnerabilities, including food insecurity and limited access to safe water, improved sanitation, healthcare and education, and that the most effective measures to reduce vulnerability in the near term are programmes that implement and improve basic public health  (very high confidence). Opportunities for co-benefits from mitigation actions were identified through such actions as reducing local emissions of short-lived climate pollutants from energy systems  (very high confidence)  and expanding transport systems that promote active travel  (high confidence). The significant growth in peer-reviewed publications on links between climate change and human health and well-being since AR5 allowed for a more detailed and wider reaching assessment in the present chapter and stronger confidence statements for many climate-sensitive health outcomes.
