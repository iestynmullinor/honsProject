Figure 7.3 provides a visual guide to this chapter. Section 7.1 has briefly summarised major global frameworks and highlights groups that exhibit heightened vulnerability and exposure to the climatic risks assessed in this chapter. Section 7.2 assesses observed impacts on health and well-being, migration and conflicts that have emerged from interactions of climate and weather-related hazards, exposure to such hazards and vulnerability of communities and systems, while Section 7.3 assesses projected future risks. Section 7.4 assesses adaptation responses to climate risks, opportunities for transformative change, co-benefits and how solutions for reducing climate impacts on health, well-being, migration and conflicts may form part of the wider CRDPs.Figure 7.3 | Structure of the chapter following a pathway from hazard, exposure and vulnerability to the observed impacts, projected future risks, adaptation and climate resilient development pathways.
