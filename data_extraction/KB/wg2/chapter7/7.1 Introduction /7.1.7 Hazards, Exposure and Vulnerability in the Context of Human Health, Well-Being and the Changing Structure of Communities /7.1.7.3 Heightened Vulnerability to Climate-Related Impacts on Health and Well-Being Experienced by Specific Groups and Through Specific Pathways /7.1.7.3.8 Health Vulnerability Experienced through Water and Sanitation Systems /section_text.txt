Water and sanitation systems are particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events, and damage to such systems can lead to contamination of drinking water and subsequent adverse health impacts (Howard et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2015; Sherpa et al., 2014). In areas with only very simple traditional excreta disposal facilities (e.g., latrines) and traditional sources of water (e.g., unprotected wells), the repeated occurrence of floods and other extreme events can negatively affect water quality at household and community levels and increase the burden of food- and waterborne diseases (Ciss√© et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2015; Kostyla et al., 2015).
