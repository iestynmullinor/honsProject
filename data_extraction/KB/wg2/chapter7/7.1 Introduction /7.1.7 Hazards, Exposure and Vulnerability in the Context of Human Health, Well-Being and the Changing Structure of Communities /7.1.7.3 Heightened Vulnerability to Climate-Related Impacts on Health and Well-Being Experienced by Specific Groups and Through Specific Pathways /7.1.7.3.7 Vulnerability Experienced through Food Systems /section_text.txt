Stresses and shocks associated with climate change are drivers of food insecurity, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America (Betts et al., 2018). The most vulnerable groups include smallholder farmers, pastoralists, agricultural laborers, poorer households, refugees, indigenous groups, women, children, the elderly and those who are socioeconomically marginalised (FAO et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019b) (high confidence). Men, women, children, the elderly and the chronically ill have different nutritional needs and these vulnerabilities may be amplified by gendered norms and differential access to resources, information and power (IPCC, 2019b). Extreme climate events have immediate and long-term impacts on food insecurity and malnutrition in poor and vulnerable communities, including when women and girls need to undertake additional duties as laborers and caregivers (FAO et al., 2018).
