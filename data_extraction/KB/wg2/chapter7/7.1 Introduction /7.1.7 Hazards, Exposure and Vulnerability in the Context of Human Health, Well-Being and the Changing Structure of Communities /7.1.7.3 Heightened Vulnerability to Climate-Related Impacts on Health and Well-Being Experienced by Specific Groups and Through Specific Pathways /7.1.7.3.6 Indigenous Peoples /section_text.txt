Indigenous Peoples, especially those who live in geographically isolated, resource-dependent and/or impoverished communities, are often at greater risk of health impacts of climate change (Ford et al., 2020) (US Global Change Research Program, 2016). The close inter-connection of land-based livelihoods and cultural identity of many indigenous groups exposes them to multiple health- and nutrition-related hazards (Durkalec et al., 2015; Sioui, 2019) with potential implications for community social relations and individual mental health (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013; Cunsolo Willox et al., 2015). Climate change risk exposures may be complicated by changes in lifestyle, diet and morbidity driven by socioeconomic processes, further increasing health risks for Indigenous Peoples (Jaakkola et al., 2018). Environmental consequences of climate change can also affect social ties and spiritual well-being, in part because land is often an integral part of their culture and spiritual identity.
