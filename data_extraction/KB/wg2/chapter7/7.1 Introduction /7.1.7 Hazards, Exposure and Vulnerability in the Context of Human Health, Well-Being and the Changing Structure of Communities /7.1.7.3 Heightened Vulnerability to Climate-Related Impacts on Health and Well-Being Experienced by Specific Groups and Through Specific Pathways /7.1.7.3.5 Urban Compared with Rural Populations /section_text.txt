Rural and urban populations are often exposed to different types of climate-related health risks. For example, because of the UHI effect and high concentrations of air pollution from motor vehicles and industrial activity, people who live in urban areas may have higher rates of extreme heat stress and respiratory illnesses than their rural counterparts (Hondula et al., 2014; Heaviside et al., 2016; Macintyre et al., 2018; Schinasi et al., 2018). Conversely, rural populations, especially those dependent on resource-based livelihoods, may have a greater exposure to climate impacts on food production or natural hazard events, which have subsequent effects on household nutrition and food security (Springmann et al., 2016a; see also Chapters 5 and 6 of this report).
