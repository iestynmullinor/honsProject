Climate change poses distinct risks to womenâ€™s health. Vulnerability to climate-related impacts on health and well-being shows notable differentiations according to gender, beyond implications for pregnant women. In many societies, differential exposure to such risks relate to gendered livelihood practices and mobility options. Pregnancy and maternal status heighten vulnerability to heat, infectious diseases, food-borne infections and air pollution (Arroyo et al., 2016; Ngo and Horton, 2016; Zhang et al., 2017b). Extreme heat events, high ambient temperatures, high concentrations of airborne particulates, water-related illnesses and natural hazards are associated with higher rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight and pre-term birth (Arroyo et al., 2016; Ngo and Horton, 2016; Abiona, 2017; Auger et al., 2017; Molina and Saldarriaga, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017b). Women and girls are at greater risk of food insecurity (FAO, 2018; Alston and Akhter, 2016), which is particularly problematic in combination with the nutritional needs associated with pregnancy or breastfeeding. Women and girls are more likely to die in extreme weather events (Garcia and Sheehan, 2016; Yang et al., 2019). Women are also expected to face a greater mental health burden in a changing climate (Manning and Clayton, 2018). Further, climatic extremes and water scarcity are associated with increases in violence against girls and women (Anwar et al., 2019; Opondo et al., 2016; Le Masson et al., 2016; Udas et al., 2019).
