Children are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Children often have unique pathways of exposure and sensitivity to climate hazards, given their immature physiology and metabolism and high intake of air, food and water relative to their body weight as compared with adults (US Global Change Research Group, 2016). Climate change is expected to increase childhood risks of malnutrition and infectious disease for children in low-income countries through its impacts on household food access, dietary diversity, nutrient quality, water and changes in maternal and childcare access and breastfeeding (Tirado, 2017; FAO et al., 2018; Perera, 2017). Children living in locations with poor sanitation are especially vulnerable to GI illnesses, with future rates of diarrhoeal diseases among children expected to rise under many climate change scenarios (Ciss√© et al., 2018; WHO, 2014). Outdoor recreational opportunities for children may be reduced by extreme weather events, heat and poor air quality (Evans, 2019). Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to post-traumatic stress after extreme weather events; the effects may even be long-lasting, with impacts on their adult functioning (Brown et al., 2017; UNICEF, 2021; Thiery et al., 2021)
