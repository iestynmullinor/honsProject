People living in poverty are more likely to be exposed to extreme heat and air pollution and have poorer access to clean water and sanitation, accentuating their exposure to climate change-associated health risks (UNEP, 2021; FAO et al., 2018). Poverty influences how people perceive the risks to which they are exposed, how they respond to evacuation orders and other emergency warnings and their ability to evacuate or relocate to a less risk-prone location (US Global Change Research Program, 2016). Poorer households, who often live in highly exposed locations, are more likely to be forced into low-agency migration as a means of adapting to climate risks and at the same time are the most likely to be immobile or trapped in deteriorating circumstances where migration would be a preferred response (Leichenko and Silva, 2014; Fazey et al., 2016; Sheller, 2018). Climate emergencies disproportionally affect people with disabilities because of their inherent vulnerabilities, which may impair their ability to take protective action; they are also frequently excluded from adaptation planning (Gaskin et al., 2017).
