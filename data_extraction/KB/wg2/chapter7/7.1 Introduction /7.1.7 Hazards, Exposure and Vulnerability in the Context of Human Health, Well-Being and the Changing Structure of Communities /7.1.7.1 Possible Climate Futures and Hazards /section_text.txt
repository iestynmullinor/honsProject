This chapter uses the conceptual framing described in Chapter 1, in which risks emerging from climate change are described in terms of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, with adaptation and climate resilient development being responses that have the potential to reduce or modify risk. The observed and projected future risks to health well-being, involuntary population displacements and conflict identified in this chapter are associated with a range of hazards that are manifested at a variety of geographical and temporal scales. These include observed and projected changes in climate normals; changes in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of extreme events; and hazards such as rising sea levels and extreme temperatures where the impacts have only begun to be widely experienced. The 2021 report of IPCC WGI (IPCC, 2021) provides an assessment of observed and projected changes in these hazards and is the backdrop against which assessments of future risks and adaptation options identified in the present chapter should be considered.The exposure to hazards of populations, infrastructure, ecosystem capital, socioeconomic systems and cultural assets critical to health and well-being varies considerably across and within regions  (high confidence). Exposure is also projected to vary across and within regions over time, depending on future GHG emissions pathways, development trajectories and differential vulnerability, particularly for exposure to extreme events and conditions, such as floods and droughts (Figures 7.1a, 7.1b) (Winsemius et al. 2018). For this reason, region-specific assessments of climate-related risks for health, displacement and conflict are found in each of the regional chapters of this report in addition to the general assessment that appears in this chapter.Figure 7.1 | Projected exposure of poor people toa)  floods respectivelyb)  droughts in selected regions by 2050 under a high emissions scenario (RCP8. 5) (adapted from Winsemius et al., 2018).
