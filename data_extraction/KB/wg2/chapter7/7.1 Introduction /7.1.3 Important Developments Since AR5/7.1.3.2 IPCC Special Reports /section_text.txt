All three post-AR5 IPCC Special Reports considered some of the research that is assessed here in greater detail. The 2018 report on 1.5Â°C (SR1.5) included a review of climate change and health literature published since AR5 and called for further efforts for protecting health and well-being of vulnerable people and regions (Ebi et al., 2018b) and highlighted links between climate change hazards, poverty, food security, migration and conflict. The 2019 Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) (IPCC, 2019b) emphasised the impacts of climate change on food security; highlighted links between reduced resilience of dryland populations, land degradation, migration and conflict; and raised concerns about the impacts of climate extremes. The 2019 Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (IPCC, 2019a) detailed how changes in the cryosphere and ocean systems have impacted people and ecosystem services, particularly food security, water resources, water quality, livelihoods, health and well-being, infrastructure, transportation, tourism and recreation as well as the culture of human societies, particularly for Indigenous Peoples. It also noted the risks of future displacements due to rising sea levels and associated coastal hazards.
