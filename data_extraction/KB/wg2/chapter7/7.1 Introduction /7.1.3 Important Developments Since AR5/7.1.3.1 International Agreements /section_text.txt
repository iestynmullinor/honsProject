Since AR5, several new international agreements have come into effect that have implications for international responses to the climate risks assessed in this chapter. The 2015 Paris Agreement, which explicitly mentions health in three separate sections, set new goals for adaptation and established a working group to study the effects of climate change on population displacement. The 17 United Nations (UN) SDGs for 2030, adopted in 2015, are all important for building adaptive capacity in general, with goals 13 (‘Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts’) and 3 (‘Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages’) being directly relevant to this chapter. Other SDGs contain specific targets that are also relevant for this chapter, including Target 10.7 (‘Well-managed migration policies’), Target 8.3 (‘Decent work for all’) and Target 5.4 (‘Promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies’) (Piper, 2017). The 2015 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction puts an emphasis on health and well-being (Aitsi-Selmi and Murray, 2016) In 2018, UN member states negotiated Global Compacts for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and on Refugees that, taken together with the Paris Agreement, provide pathways for coordinated international responses to climate-related migration and displacement (Warner, 2018).
