Since AR5, more comprehensive frameworks for framing and studying global health issues, including planetary health, ‘One Health’ and eco-health, have gained traction. These frameworks share an ecological perspective, emphasise the role of complex systems and highlight the need for inter-disciplinary approaches related to human health research and practice (Lerner and Berg, 2015; Zinsstag et al., 2018; Whitmee et al., 2015; Steffen et al., 2015). These frameworks increasingly shape the evidence related to climate change health impacts and response options, highlight the dynamics of complex systems in risk management and direct risk management efforts in new directions.Building on these frameworks and perspectives, there is increasing overlap in the literature on global health, climate change impacts and estimates of loss and damage. The Global Burden of Disease study for 2019 for the first time included non-optimal temperature as a risk factor (Murray et al., 2020). Work by social scientists continues to explore how climate change indirectly affects resource availability, productivity, migration and conflict (Burke et al., 2015a; Carleton and Hsiang, 2016; Hsiang et al., 2017), bringing multiple lines of inquiry together to study the associations between global environmental changes, socioeconomic dynamics and impacts on health and well-being. Morbidity associated with migration and displacement, especially in the context of small island states, has been identified as a non-material form of loss and damage (Thomas and Benjamin, 2020; McNamara et al., 2021). Social costs of carbon estimates have been updated to include excess mortality associated with climate change, increasing estimates substantially (Dressler, 2021).
