Key statements made in AR5 Chapter 12 (Human Security) about the impacts of climate change on migration were that climate change will have significant impacts on forms of migration that compromise human security and that mobility is a widely used strategy to maintain livelihoods in response to social and environmental changes (high agreement, medium evidence). Research on the influence of climate change and climate extremes on multiple forms of migration (including voluntary migration, involuntary displacement and immobility) has expanded significantly since AR5, which has allowed for a more robust assessment in this chapter, with migration also featuring in most other sectoral and regional chapters of this report. With respect to violent conflict, AR5 Chapter 12 found that people living in places affected by violent conflict are particularly vulnerable to climate change (medium evidence, high agreement ), that some of the factors increasing the risk of violent conflict within states are sensitive to climate change (medium evidence, medium agreement ) and that climate change will lead to new challenges to states and will increasingly shape both conditions of security and national security policies (medium evidence, medium agreement ). As with other subjects assessed in this chapter, there has been significant growth in the number of assessable studies, but there remain shortcomings with respect to the availability of evidence regarding the specific nature of causal linkages and the attributability of particular outcomes to climate events or conditions.
