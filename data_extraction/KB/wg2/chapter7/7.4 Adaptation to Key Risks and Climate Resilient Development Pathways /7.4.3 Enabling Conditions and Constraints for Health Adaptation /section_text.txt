Adaptation decisions and responses to climate change can be influenced by perceptions of risks, which are shaped by individuals’ characteristics, knowledge and experience (medium agreement, medium evidence). Institutional and governmental responses are critical for adapting to climate-related risks in health and other sectors, but individual responses also are relevant, such as choosing to implement adaptation measures. Individual responses are in turn affected not only by capabilities but also by perceptions that climate change is real and requires a response (Ogunbode et al., 2019). Perceptions of climate risks are formed by experiences of changes in local weather and extreme weather events (Sattler et al., 2018; Sattler et al., 2020; van der Linden, 2015), observations of environmental changes (Hornsey et al., 2016), experiences of and knowledge about climate change impacts (Ngo et al., 2020; van der Linden, 2015) and individual characteristics such as values and worldviews (Poortinga et al., 2019) (high agreement, medium evidence). Risk perceptions include both logical assessments about the likelihood and severity of climate change impacts and affective feelings about those impacts. On average, affective measures of risk perception are more strongly associated with disaster preparation than cognitive measures (Bamberg et al., 2017; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019).In addition to perceptions of risk, the likelihood that an individual will implement behavioural adaptations or support relevant public policy is affected by subjective assessments of the response options (Bamberg et al., 2017; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019; Akompab et al., 2013; Carman and Zint, 2020; Hornsey et al., 2016; Brenkert-Smith et al., 2015).Efficacy beliefs, social norms and subjective resilience also affect adaptation behaviour (medium confidence), which has implications for communication about the need for climate adaptation. Efficacy beliefs represent the belief in one’s ability to carry out particular action(s) and the belief that the action(s) will have the desired outcome. Belief that one is personally able to complete a behaviour is moderately associated with engaging in disaster preparations (Navarro et al., 2021; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019) and with adaptation intentions (Burnham and Ma, 2017). Collective efficacy, the belief that a group of people working together can achieve a desired outcome, is important for participating in community adaptation behaviours (Bandura, 1982; Chen, 2015; Thaker et al., 2015). Related to this is response efficacy, a belief that a behaviour will achieve its desired outcome, which is also moderately associated with engaging in disaster preparations (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019). Collective efficacy can potentially be developed by strengthening communication networks and social ties within a community (Haas et al., 2021; Jugert et al., 2016). Norms describing the adaptation strategies of others in a community, particularly those with high social status, can either facilitate or inhibit individual adaptation decisions (Neef et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2021).Distinct from efficacy beliefs, subjective resilience is a more general optimism or belief about one’s ability (Jones, 2019; Khanian et al., 2019). Subjective resilience (Clare et al., 2017) can influence preferred responses to climate change via assessment of one’s ability to engage in specific response options. Identities can influence assessment of subjective resilience. Place attachment, having a strong emotional connection to a particular location, is weakly associated with disaster preparation (Brügger et al., 2015). In some cases, place attachment may inhibit adaptive responses, either by reducing perceptions of risk or by making people reluctant to leave an area that is threatened (De Dominicis et al., 2015; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019). Place attachment can also contribute to enhanced community resilience (Khanian et al., 2019; Jones, 2019; Wang et al., 2021).
