The WHO Operational Framework for building climate-resilient health systems was designed to increase the capacity of health systems and public health programming to protect health in an unstable and changing climate (WHO, 2015b). The guidance defines a climate-resilient health system as one that is capable to anticipate, respond to, cope with, recover from and adapt to climate-related shocks and stress, so as to bring sustained improvements in population health despite an unstable climate. Full implementation of this framework has the potential to achieve transformational adaptation; the fundamental attributes of health systems would change to anticipate and effectively manage the population health and healthcare risks of climate change. This includes having the knowledge, capacity, tools and human and financial resources for health systems to extend beyond soft limits to adaptation.The WHO framework outlines 10 key components (Figure 7.15) that, when achieved, will:Guide professionals working in health systems and in health determining sectors (e.g., water and sanitation, food and agriculture, energy, and urban planning) to understand and effectively prepare for the additional health risks posed by climate variability and changeIdentify the main health functions that need to be strengthened to build climate resilience, and to use these to develop comprehensive and practical plans (e.g., the health component of National Adaptation Plans (H-NAP))Support health decision makers to identify roles and responsibilities to implement this plan for actors within and outside the formal health sectorFigure 7.15 | Ten components of the WHO operational framework for building climate-resilient health systems with links to the building blocks of health systems.
