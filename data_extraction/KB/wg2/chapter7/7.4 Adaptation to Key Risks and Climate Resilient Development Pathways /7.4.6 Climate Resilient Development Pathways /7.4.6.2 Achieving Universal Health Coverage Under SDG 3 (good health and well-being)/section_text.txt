UHC is when all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship (WHO, 2021b). Achieving UHC is one of the targets in the SDGs. However, climate change is threatening to undermine the achievement of UHC through negative health outcomes and healthcare system disruptions (Salas and Jha, 2019; Phillips et al., 2020; Kadandale et al., 2020; Roa et al., 2020). Climate change adaptation and UHC progress are closely linked to one another, as both may improve health and achieve health equity (Salas and Jha, 2019). Supporting UHC is key to securing population health under a changing climate as well as addressing structural inequalities (Roos et al., 2021; Aleksandrova, 2020; Phillips et al., 2020). Many regions of the world with the highest levels of vulnerability to the health impacts of climate change also have low levels of UHC; an integrated approach to UHC planning that incorporates climate change will have great benefits particularly in improving health equity (Salas and Jha, 2019).The COVID-19 pandemic has shown some countries taking positive steps to achieving UHC. For example, Ireland nationalised healthcare for the duration of the pandemic and many countries, including Australia, have enhanced their telehealth services, which has enabled specific groups to access health services, particularly those in rural and remote settings, and has allowed continuous care to the community (Monaghesh and Hajizadeh, 2020; Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7).
