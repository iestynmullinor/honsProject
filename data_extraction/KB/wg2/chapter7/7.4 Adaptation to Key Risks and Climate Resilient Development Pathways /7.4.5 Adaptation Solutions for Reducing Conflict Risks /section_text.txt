Gender-based approaches provide novel under-utilised pathways to achieving sustainable peace (high confidence).  Security council resolutions have encouraged the incorporation of gender analysis into peacebuilding and research has shown that taking into account the gendered nature of networks and dialogues opens new avenues for cooperation that are conflict sensitive (Dunn and Matthew, 2015), creating potential for women’s rights and advocacy groups to be drivers of peace (Céspedes-Báez, 2018). For example, women are working to reduce climate vulnerability security risks in urban settings by entering local politics and joining community-based organised and civil society networks (Kellog, 2020). The gendered nature of vulnerability and access to natural resources (Sections 4.6.4, 4.7.5.3, 5.4.2.3, 5.5.2.6, 5.8.2.2; Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18) will influence the efficacy of interventions to prevent conflict or to build durable peace (Pearse, 2017; Chandra et al., 2017; Fröhlich et al., 2018). However, this understanding has not so far resulted in widespread employment of gender-led analyses (Fröhlich and Gioli, 2015). This represents a key opportunity for expansion of the solution space for climate-related conflict. Analysis of peace processes more generally demonstrates the benefits of women’s participation in peace processes for devising strategies for building peace (Paffenholz, 2018; Cárdenas and Olivius, 2021) and for the durability of that peace (Shair-Rosenfield and Wood, 2017; Krause et al., 2018).
