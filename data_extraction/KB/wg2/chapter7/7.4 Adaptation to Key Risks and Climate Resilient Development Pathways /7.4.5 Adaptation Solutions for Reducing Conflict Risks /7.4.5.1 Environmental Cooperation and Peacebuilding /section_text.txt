The environment can form the basis for active peacebuilding, and a sustainable natural environment is important for ongoing peace (high agreement, medium evidence). EP is a framework increasingly utilised to understand the diverse ways in which the natural environment supports peace and can be utilised in peacebuilding; key tenets include preserving the natural environment such that degradation does not contribute to violence, protecting natural resources during conflict and using natural resources to support post-conflict economic recovery (Kron, 2019). EP frames natural resources as facilitating peace rather than driving conflict (Dresse et al., 2019) with emerging literature analysing what this means in practice (Kovach and Conca, 2016; Krampe, 2017; Ide, 2019; Ide et al., 2021; Johnson, 2021; Kalilou, 2021). There is emergent evidence for the success of EP pathways. For example, a natural resource sharing agreement on the Kenyaâ€“Uganda border was able to reconcile spatial, logistical and conceptual barriers to addressing climate risks in development contexts (Abrahams, 2020). However, the long-term impacts of EP approaches on sustaining peace are yet to be monitored and evaluated (Ide and Tubi, 2020). EP may be successful depending on the context and the element of peace being built (Johnson, 2021) or undermine processes when environmental arguments are co-opted for geopolitical purposes (Barquet, 2015) or to depoliticise conflict (Ide, 2020).Formal institutional arrangements for natural resource management can contribute to transnational cooperation (high confidence) (see also Chapter 4). Evidence from transboundary water sharing agreements provides evidence for cooperation rather than conflict over resources (Timmerman et al., 2017; Timmerman, 2020; Dinar et al., 2015). Transboundary water agreements and river basin organisations help build robust institutions that facilitate trust and relationship building that have benefits in other domains (strong agreement, medium evidence) (Dombrowsky, 2010; Krampe and Gignoux, 2018; Barquet et al., 2014; Ide and Detges 2018). However, outcomes can be mixed, and the international and top down nature of these approaches may limit their transferability to intra-state conflicts at local levels (Rigi and Warner, 2020; Ide et al., 2021; Krampe et al., 2021).
