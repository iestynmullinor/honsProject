AR5 (Chapter 17) concluded that migration is often, though not in all situations, a potential form of adaptation initiated by households. Subsequent research indicates that the circumstances under which migration occurs and the degree of agency under which household migration decisions are made are important determinants of whether migration outcomes are successful in terms of advancing the well-being of the household and providing benefits to sending and receiving communities (high confidence) (Adger et al., 2015; Cattaneo et al., 2019; Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). Evidence from refugee studies and general migration research indicates that higher agency migration, in which migrants have mobility options, allows migrants greater opportunities for integrating into labour markets at the destination, makes it easier to remit money home and generally creates conditions for potential benefits for migrant households and for sending and receiving communities (International Organization for Migration, 2019). Bilateral agreements that facilitate labour migration have been identified as being especially urgently needed for Pacific small island states (Weber, 2017).Adaptive migration and the implied assumption that people can or should simply move out of harmâ€™s way is not a substitute for investment in adaptive capacity-building (high agreement ) (Bettini and Gioli, 2016). Climate-related migration, and especially involuntary displacement, often occurs only after in situ adaptation options have been exhausted and/or where government actions are inadequate (Adger et al., 2015; Ocello et al., 2015; Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). The threshold at which household adaptation transitions from in situ measures to migration is highly context specific and reflects the degree of exposure to specific climate risks, mobility options and the socioeconomic circumstances of the household and local community (McLeman, 2017; Adams and Kay, 2019; Semenza and Ebi, 2019; Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). A consistent theme in the research literature reviewed for all sections of this chapter is that proactive investments in health, social and physical infrastructure, including those not aimed specifically at climate risks, build societal adaptive capacity and household resilience. In turn, expanding the range of adaptation options available to households increases the likelihood that, when migration does occur, it does so under conditions of high agency that lead to greater chances of success. In communities where climate-related migration and/or relocation is occurring or may occur, policymaking and planning benefits from understanding the cultural, social and economic needs of exposed populations and helps in the identification of responses and policies that build resilience (Hino et al. 2017)
