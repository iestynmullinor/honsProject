Adaptive climate-related migration is often closely related to wage-seeking labour migration (medium confidence). Due to the circumstances under which they move, climate-related migrants’ destinations, labour market choices and returns from migration may be more heavily constrained than those of other labour migrants (Jessoe et al., 2018; Wrathall and Suckall, 2016).Within low- and middle-income countries, rural–urban migrant networks are important channels for remittances that may help build socioeconomic resilience to climate hazards in sending areas (Porst and Sakdapolrak, 2020), with higher levels of wage-seeking labour participation observed in climate-sensitive locales in south Asia (Maharjan et al., 2020). Local-level research in China and south Asia shows, however, that the potential for remittances to generate improvements in household level adaptive capacity is highly context specific, has significant gender dimensions and depends on such factors as the nature of the hazard, the distance migrated and the length of time over which remittances are received (Banerjee et al., 2019a; Banerjee et al., 2019b). Social networks are a key asset in helping climate migrants overcome financial and structural impediments to their mobility, but these have their limits, particularly with respect to international migration (Semenza and Ebi, 2019). Since AR5, greater restrictions have emerged on movement between many low- and high-income countries (not including those necessitated by public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic), a trend that, if it continues, would generate additional constraints on destination choices for future climate migrants (McLeman, 2019). Transnational diasporic connections are a potential asset for building resilience in migrant-sending communities highly exposed to climatic risks, with migrants’ remittances potentially providing resources for long-term resilience building, recovery from extreme events and reducing income inequality (Bragg et al., 2018; Mosuela et al., 2015; Obokata and Veronis, 2018; Shayegh, 2017; Semenza and Ebi, 2019). Safe and orderly labour migration is consequently a potentially beneficial component of wider cross-sectoral approaches to building adaptive capacity and supporting sustainable development in regions highly exposed to climate risks (McLeman, 2019).
