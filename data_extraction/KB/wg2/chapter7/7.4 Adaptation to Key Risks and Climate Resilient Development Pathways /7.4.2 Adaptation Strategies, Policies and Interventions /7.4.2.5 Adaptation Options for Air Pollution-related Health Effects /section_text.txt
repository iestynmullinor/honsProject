As noted in Section 7.3.1.6, air pollution projections indicate ambitious emission reduction scenarios or stabilisation of global temperature change at 2°C or below would yield substantial co-benefits for air quality-related health outcomes. Improvements in air quality could be achieved by the deliberate adoption of a range of adaptation options to complement mitigation measures such as decarbonisation (e.g., renewable energy, fuel switching, energy efficiency gains and carbon capture storage and utilisation) and negative emissions technologies (e.g., bioenergy carbon capture and storage, soil carbon sequestration, afforestation and reforestation and wetland construction and restoration).Adaptation options for air pollution include implementing ozone precursor emission control programmes; developing mass transit/efficient public transport systems in large cities; encouraging car-pooling, cycling and walking (active transport); traffic congestion charges; low emission zones in cities; integrated urban planning implementing NbS such as green infrastructure for pollutant interception and removal; managing wildfire risk regionally and across jurisdictional boundaries; developing air quality warning systems; altering activity on high pollution days; effective air pollution risk communication and education; wearing protective equipment such as face masks; avoiding solid fuels for cooking and indoor heating; ventilating and isolating cooking areas; and using portable air cleaners fitted with high-efficiency particulate air filters (Abhijith et al., 2017; Carlsten et al., 2020; Cromar et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2021; Holman et al., 2015; Jennings et al., 2021; Kelly et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2019; Masselot et al., 2019; Ng et al., 2021; Riley, 2021; Voordeckers et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2017; Table 7.5). While the range of air pollution adaptation options is potentially extensive, barriers may need to be overcome to achieve successful implementation, including financial, institutional, political (i.e. inter- and intra-governmental) and social barriers (Barnes et al., 2014; Ekstrom and Bedsworth, 2018; Fogg-Rogers et al., 2021; Schumacher and Shandas, 2019).Table 7.5 |  Summary of adaptation options for key health risks associated with air pollution.Key riskGeographic regionConsequence that would be considered severe and to whomHazard conditions that would contribute to this risk being severeExposure conditions that would contribute to this risk being severeVulnerability conditions that would contribute to this risk being severeAdaptation options with high potential for reducing riskSelected key referencesAir pollution-related health effectsGlobal, but especially in regions with existing poor air quality, particularly in relation to PM and ozoneGreatest climate change driven ozone-related mortality is expected for East Asia and North AmericaFor PM the highest climate and air quality-related mortalities are projected for India, the Middle East, Former Soviet Union and East AsiaSubstantial increase in air pollution-related mortality and morbidity rates, especially in urban centres, related to both severe pollution episodes and longer-term deterioration of air qualityPeople particularly vulnerable include those with RTIs and CVDIncrease in mental illness (depression) as a result of poor air quality and visibilityNon-achievement of emission reduction targetsSubstantial increase in frequency and duration of meteorological conditions conducive to the buildup of both primary and secondary air pollutants (e.g., greater frequency of calm atmospheric ‘blocking’ conditions) and no long-term improvement in air quality at a range of geographical scales (global to local)Increase in frequency and intensity of wildfires and dust stormsIncrease in the intensity of UHIs, especially in the summer, and the occurrence of ozone episodes due to anomalously high urban temperaturesLarge increases in exposure to air pollutants driven by demographic change (e.g., aging) and increasing urbanisationFor arid regions increases in exposure to dust stormsAreas adjacent/downwind of major wildfiresFor urban populations intensifying UHIs and enhanced formation of secondary pollutantsIncreases in the number of very young and elderly and those with respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, and lack of adaptation capacity (e.g., reduced reliance on solid fuel for cooking/heating)Mental illness: Lack of access to healthcare systems and servicesAir quality management policies, air quality warning systems, efficient and cheap mass transit systems, integrated urban planning (including NbS and green infrastructure)Broader understanding of air pollution hazard and better access to public health systems for the most vulnerableApplication where possible of renewable energy sources to reduce emissionsCarlsten et al.
