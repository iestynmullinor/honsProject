Since AR5, the value of cross-sectoral collaboration to advance sustainable development has been more widely recognised, but despite acknowledgement of the importance of health adaptation as a key component, action has been slow (high confidence). Building climate-resilient health systems will require multi-sectoral, multi-system and collaborative efforts at all governance scales (very high confidence) (Sections 7.4.1, 7.4.2). Globally, health systems are poorly resourced in general, and their capacity to respond to climate change is weak, with mental health support being particularly inadequate (very high confidence). The health sectors of some countries have focused on implementing incremental changes to policies and measures to fill the adaptation gap (very high confidence). As the likelihood of dangerous risks to human health continue to increase, there is greater need for transformational changes to health and other systems (very high confidence). This highlights an urgent and immediate need to address the wider interactions between environmental change, socioeconomic development and human health and well-being  (high confidence)  {7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.4.3}.Targeted investments in health and other systems, including multi-sectoral, integrated approaches to protect against key health risks can effectively increase resilience (high confidence). Increased investment in strengthening general health systems, along with targeted investments to enhance protection against specific climate-sensitive exposures (e.g., hazard early warning and response systems, and integrated vector control programmes for VBDs) will increase resilience if implemented to at least keep pace with climate change  (high confidence). The future effects of climate change on VBDs can be significantly offset through enhanced commitment to and implementation of integrated vector control management approaches, disease surveillance, early warning systems and vaccine development  (very high confidence)  (Sections 7.4.1, 7.4.2).Adaptation options for future climate risks associated with waterborne and food-borne diseasess include improving access to potable water, reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to flooding and extreme weather events, and improved (including expanded) early warning systems  (very high confidence)  (Sections 7.4.1, 7.4.2).Adaptation options for future extreme heat risks include heat action plans (HAPs) that incorporate early warning and response systems for urban and non-urban settings; tried, tested and iteratively updated response strategies targeting both the general population and vulnerable groups such as older adults or outside workers; and effective stakeholder communication plans (high confidence). These short-term responses can be complemented by longer-term urban planning and design, including nature-based solutions (NbS) that mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effects  (high confidence)  (Sections 7.4.1, 7.4.2, 7.4.3).Adaptation options to reduce the future risks of malnutrition include access to healthy, affordable, diverse diets from sustainable food systems  (high confidence)  ; health services including maternal, child and reproductive health (high confidence); nutrition services, nutrition and shock sensitive social protection (high confidence); water, sanitation and early warning systems  (high confidence)  ; and risk reduction schemes such as insurance  (medium confidence)  (Section 7.4.2.1.3).The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the value of coordinated and multi-sectoral planning, social protection systems, safety nets and other capacities in societies to cope with a range of shocks and stresses (high confidence)  . The pandemic has posed a severe shock to many socioeconomic systems, resulting in substantial changes in vulnerability and exposure of people to climate risks (high confidence). The pandemic emphasises the inter-connected and compound nature of risks, vulnerabilities, and responses to emergencies that are simultaneously local and global  (high confidence). Pathways to climate resilient development can be pursued simultaneously with recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic  (high confidence). The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated climate risks, demonstrated the global and local vulnerability to cascading shocks and illustrated the importance of integrated solutions that tackle ecosystem degradation and structural vulnerabilities in human societies  (high confidence)  {Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7}.Transitioning towards equitable, low-carbon societies has multiple benefits for health and well-being (very high confidence)  . Benefits for health and well-being can be gained from wide-spread, equitable access to affordable renewable energy (high confidence); active transport (e.g., walking and cycling) (high confidence); green buildings and nature-based solutions, such as green and blue urban infrastructure (high confidence);  and by transitioning to a low-carbon, well-being-oriented and equity-oriented economy consistent with the aims of the SDGs  (high confidence). Plant-rich diets consistent with international recommendations for healthy diets could contribute to lower GHG emissions while also generating health co-benefits, such as reducing ill health related to over-consumption of animal-based products  (high confidence)  {7.4.2; Cross-Chapter Box HEALTH in Chapter 7; 7.4.4}.Reducing future risks of involuntary migration and displacement due to climate change is possible through cooperative international efforts to enhance institutional adaptive capacity and sustainable development  (high confidence). Institutional and cross-sectoral efforts to build adaptive capacity, coupled with policies aimed at ensuring safe and orderly movements of people within and between states, can form part of the CRDPs that reduce future risks of climate-related involuntary migration, displacement and immobility  (medium confidence). In locations where permanent, government-assisted relocation becomes unavoidable, active involvement of local populations in planning and decision-making increases the likelihood of successful outcomes  (medium confidence). People who live on small island states do not view relocation as an appropriate or desirable means of adapting to the impacts of climate change  (high confidence)  {7.4.3; Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7}.Adaptation and sustainable development build peace in conflict-prone regions by addressing the drivers of grievances that lead to conflict and vulnerability to climate change (high confidence). Environmental peacebuilding (EP) through natural resource sharing, conflict-sensitive adaptation and climate-resilient peacebuilding offer promising avenues for addressing conflict risk, but their efficacy is still to be demonstrated through effective monitoring and evaluation  (high confidence). Formal institutional arrangements for natural resource management contribute to wider cooperation and peacebuilding  (high confidence)  and gender-based approaches provide under-utilised pathways to achieving sustainable peace  (medium confidence). Inclusion, cross-issue and cross-sectoral integration in policy and programming, and approaches that incorporate different geographical scales and work across national boundaries can support climate-resilient peace  (high confidence)  {7.4.5, 7.4.6}.
