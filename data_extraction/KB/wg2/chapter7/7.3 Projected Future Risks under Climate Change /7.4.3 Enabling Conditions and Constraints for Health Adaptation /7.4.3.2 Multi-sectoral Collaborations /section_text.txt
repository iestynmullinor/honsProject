Multi-sectoral collaborations aimed at strengthening the health sector can generate multiple co-benefits in other sectors (high agreement, medium evidence). Solutions for the health and well-being risks described in 7.2 and 7.3 often have their origins in sectors that include water, sanitation, agriculture, food systems, social protection systems, energy and key components of urban systems such as housing and employment (WHO, 2015a; Bowen et al., 2014b; Machalaba et al., 2015; Confalonieri et al., 2015; Bowen et al., 2014a; Semenza, 2021). Climate resilient development pursued in these other sectors, and in cooperation with the health sector, simultaneously increases the potential for adaptation and climate resilience in terms of health and well-being  (high confidence)  (Ahmad et al., 2017; Watts et al., 2018b; Levy and Patz, 2015; WHO, 2018a; Chiabai et al., 2018a; Dudley et al., 2015; Zinsstag et al., 2018; Sherpa et al., 2014).
