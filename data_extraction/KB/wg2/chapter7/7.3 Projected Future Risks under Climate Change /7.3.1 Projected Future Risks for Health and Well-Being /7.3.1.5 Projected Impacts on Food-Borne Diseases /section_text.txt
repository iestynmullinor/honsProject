The prevalence of  Salmonella infections is expected to rise as higher temperatures enable more rapid replication (medium confidence). Research from Canada finds a very strong association of salmonellosis and other FBDs with higher temperatures, suggesting that climate change could increase food safety risks ranging from increased public health burden to emergent risks not currently seen in the food chain (Smith and Fazil, 2019). In Europe, the average annual number of temperature-related cases of salmonellosis under high emissions scenarios could increase by up to 50% more than would be expected on the basis of on population change alone by 2100 (Lake, 2017; European Environment Agency, 2017). Warming trends in the southern USA may lead to increased rates of Salmonella infections (Akil et al., 2014).
