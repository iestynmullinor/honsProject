Additional research is needed on future impacts of climate change on maternal, foetal and neonatal health . Maternal heat exposure is a risk factor for several adverse maternal, foetal and neonatal outcomes (Kuehn and McCormick, 2017), including foetal growth (Sun et al., 2019) and congenital anomalies (Haghighi et al., 2021). There is very limited research on this subject, an exception being Zhang et al. (2020), which projected a 34% increase in congenital health disease risk in the USA in 2025 and 2035 based on increased maternal extreme heat exposure.
