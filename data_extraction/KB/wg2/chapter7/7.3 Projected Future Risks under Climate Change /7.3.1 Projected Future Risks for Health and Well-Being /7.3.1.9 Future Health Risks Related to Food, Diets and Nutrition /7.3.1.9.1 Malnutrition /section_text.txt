Climate change is projected to exacerbate malnutrition (high confidence). Moderate and severe stunting in children less than five years of age was projected for 2030 across 44 countries to be an additional 570,000 cases under a prosperity and low climate change scenario (RCP2.6) to one million cases under a poverty and high climate change scenario (RCP8.5), with the highest effects in rural areas (Lloyd, 2018). Future DALYs lost due to protein-energy undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies without climate change have been projected to increase between 2010 and 2050 by over 30 million; with climate change (RCP8.5), DALYs were projected to increase by nearly 10%, with the largest increases in Africa and Asia (Sulser et al., 2021).The projected risks of hunger and childhood underweight vary under the five SSPs, with population growth, improvement in the equality of food distribution and income-related increases in food consumption influencing future risks (Ishida et al., 2014; Hasegawa et al., 2015). A review of 57 studies projecting global food security to 2050 under the SSPs concluded that global food demand was expected to increase by 35–56% between 2010 and 2050 (van Dijk et al., 2021). In the same review, estimates of the change in population at risk of hunger by 2050 range between −91 to +8% if climate change is not considered and between -91 to +30% if climate change is considered, with the inclusion of climate change not leading to statistically significant differences in projections (van Dijk et al., 2021).
