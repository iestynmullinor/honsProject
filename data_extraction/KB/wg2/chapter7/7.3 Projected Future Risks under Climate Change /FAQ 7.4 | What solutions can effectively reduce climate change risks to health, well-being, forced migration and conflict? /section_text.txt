The solution space includes policies, strategies and programmes that consider why, how, when and who should be involved to sustainably adapt to climate change. Effectively preparing for and managing the health risks of climate change requires considering the multiple interacting sectors that affect population health and effective functioning of health systems. Considering the close inter-connections between health, migration and conflict, interventions that address climate risks in one area often have synergistic benefits in others. For example, conflicts often result in large numbers of people being involuntarily displaced and facilitate the spread of climate-sensitive diseases; tackling the underlying causes of vulnerability and exposure that generate conflict reduces risks across all areas. A key starting point for health and well-being is strengthening public health systems so that they become more climate resilient, which also requires cooperation with other sectors (water, food, sanitation, transportation, etc.) to ensure appropriate funding and progress on sustainable development goals. Interventions to enhance protection against specific climate-sensitive health risks could reduce morbidity and mortality and prevent many losses and damages (Figure FAQ7.4.1). These range from malaria net initiatives, vector control programmes, health hazard (syndromic) surveillance and early warning systems, improving access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), heat action plans (HAPs), behavioural changes and integration with disaster risk reduction (DRR) and response strategies. More importantly, climate resilient development pathways (CRDPs) are essential to improve overall health and well-being, reduce underlying causes of vulnerability and provide a framework for prioritising mitigation and adaptation options that support sustainable development. Transformative changes in key sectors including water, food, energy, transportation and built environments offer significant co-benefits for health.Figure FAQ7.4.1 |  Solution space for adaptation to climate change in health and other sectors.Open figure
