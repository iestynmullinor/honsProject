Climate change will affect human health and well-being in a variety of direct and indirect ways that depend on exposure to hazards and vulnerabilities that are heterogeneous and vary within societies, and that are influenced by social, economic and geographical factors and individual differences (see Figure FAQ7.1.1). Changes in the magnitude, frequency and intensity of extreme climate events (e.g., storms, floods, wildfires, heatwaves and dust storms) will expose people to increased risks of climate-sensitive illnesses and injuries and, in the worst cases, higher mortality rates. Increased risks for mental health and well-being are associated with changes caused by the impacts of climate change on climate-sensitive health outcomes and systems (see Figure FAQ7.1.2). Higher temperatures and changing geographical and seasonal precipitation patterns will facilitate the spread of mosquito- and tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease and dengue fever, and water- and food-borne diseases. An increase in the frequency of extreme heat events will exacerbate health risks associated with cardiovascular disease and affect access to freshwater in multiple regions, impairing agricultural productivity and increasing food insecurity, undernutrition and poverty in low-income areas.Figure FAQ7.1.1 |  Pathways from hazards, exposure and vulnerabilities to climate change impacts on health outcomes and health systems.WBD: waterborne disease, VBD: Vector-borne disease, and FBD: Food-borne disease.Open figure Figure FAQ7.1.2 | Climate change impacts on mental health and key adaptation responses.
