Many actions taken in other sectors to address the risks of climate change can lead to benefits for health and well-being. Adaptive urban design that provides greater access to green and natural spaces simultaneously enhances biodiversity, improves air quality and moderates the hydrological cycle; it also helps reduce health risks associated with heat stress and respiratory illnesses, and mitigates mental health challenges associated with congested urban living. Transitioning away from internal-combustion vehicles and fossil fuel-powered generating stations to renewable energy mitigates greenhouse gas emissions, improves air quality and lowers the risks of respiratory illnesses. Policies and designs that facilitate active urban transport (walking and bicycling) increase efficiency in that sector, reduce emissions, improve air quality and generate physical and mental health benefits for residents. Improved building and urban design that foster energy efficiency improve indoor air quality and reduce risks of heat stress and respiratory illness. Food systems that emphasise healthy, plant-centred diets reduce emissions in the agricultural sector while helping in the fight against malnutrition.
