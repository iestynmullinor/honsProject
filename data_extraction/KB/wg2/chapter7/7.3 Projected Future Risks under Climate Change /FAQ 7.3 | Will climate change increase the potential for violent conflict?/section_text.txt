Climate hazards have affected armed conflict within countries but the observed influence of climate is small relative to socioeconomic, political and cultural factors. Adverse impacts of climate change threaten to increase poverty and inequality, undermine progress in meetings Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and place strain on civil institutions—all of which are factors that contribute to the emergence or worsening of civil unrest and conflict. Climate change impacts on crop productivity and water availability can function as a ‘risk multiplier’ for conflict in areas that are already politically and/or socially fragile and, depending on circumstances, could increase the length or the nature of an existing conflict. Institutional initiatives within or between states to protect the environment and manage natural resources can serve simultaneously as mechanisms for engaging rival groups and adversaries to cooperate in policymaking and peacebuilding.
