Climate change will have impacts on future migration patterns that will vary by region and over time, depending on the types of climate risks people are exposed to, their vulnerability to those risks and their capacity—and the capacity of their governments—to adapt and respond. Depending on the range of adaptation options available, households may use migration as a strategy to adapt to climate risks, often through labour migration. The most common drivers of climate-related displacement are extreme weather events, floods and droughts, especially when these events cause severe damage to homes, livelihoods and food systems. Rising sea levels will present a new risk for communities situated in low-lying coastal areas and small island states. The greater the scale of future warming and extreme events, the greater the potential scale of future, involuntary climate-related migration and displacement.Progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has strong potential to reduce future involuntary climate-related migration and displacement.
