Rapid changes occurring in polar systems are clear and unequivocal, indicating that swift and effective responses are urgently needed to avoid substantial future impacts and reduce risks to polar social and ecological systems. Some underlying principles emerge from this assessment that appear fundamental to achieving climate resilient development in polar systems (Figure CCP6.8) because they could facilitate rapid, equitable and just responses to achieve climate resilience. These principles include having locally relevant and accessible tools and services (e.g., regional forecasts and projections) to support climate-informed decision making, along with adequate and appropriate resourcing (including finance and integrated planning) for climate adaptation and for responding to emergencies. Effective decision making processes integrate across sectors, all levels of governance, including through multi-national instruments, and, most importantly, apply low-cost and inclusive participatory processes to address gender, equitable and socially just outcomes. In the Arctic, there is evidence that overcoming colonialism through meaningful and explicit inclusion of IK in research and resource management, as well as co-management and self-determination in decision making, are effective measures to support equitable climate resilience across multiple sectors. Lastly, climate resilience is strongly dependent on both mitigation of climate change as well as effective adaptation to meet the challenges of unprecedented change in polar regions.Figure CCP6.8 | Six principles that support climate-resilient pathways in the polar regions.
