In a study of adaptation progress across the Arctic from 2004 to 2019, 233 cases of adaptation were documented, with the majority of actions primarily behavioural and reactionary in nature and undertaken in the subsistence harvesting sector, with resource management, and infrastructure and transportation other prominent sectors where adaptation responses were documented to be occurring (Canosa et al., 2020). The study found few changes in the profile of adaptation over time, except for an increase in responses being motivated solely by climate impacts, and few cases of transformational change, although it should be noted that a lack of data on adaptation actions makes documenting trends challenging. Human health is generally under-represented in adaptation initiatives, along with adaptations being developed within larger Arctic settlements (Ford et al., 2014; Canosa et al., 2020), and in many sectors decisions continue to be made without explicit inclusion of climate change impacts and risk in planning and design (high confidence) (Cherry et al., 2017; Lauta et al., 2018; Meredith et al., 2019). There is limited evidence of transformational adaptation taking place in the policy arena (e.g., U.S. Executive Order 13990, 2021), but many examples of how impacts and responses to climate change have transformed socialâ€“ecological connections, traditions, markets, trade and livelihoods of Arctic residents and Indigenous Peoples (Ford et al., 2015).
