Across polar regions, adaptation responses to climate change impacts have ranged from rapid and incremental (e.g., shifting phenologies, alternative harvest or herding strategies) to large and transformative (e.g., switching livelihoods, social–ecological system transformation) (Figure CCP6.6). Some adaptation measures and opportunities induce novel risks to other sectors or systems resulting in cascading and compounding consequences that are sometimes hard to predict or prepare for (Huntington et al., 2015) (Table CCP6.6). Adaptation planning and implementation is greater in the Arctic than Antarctic regions, in part due to disparate magnitudes of realised climate impacts and change between regions (Figure CCP6.2; Table CCP6.1) but also because of the differing governance systems in place (Meredith et al., 2019). In the Antarctic region, a climate action plan has been developed for terrestrial systems but not for the Southern Ocean (Meredith et al., 2019), although strategies for adapting to climate change have been proposed, including incorporation of precaution in decision making (Constable et al., 2017). In the Arctic, climate change information is increasingly integrated into research, policy and decision making including incorporation of climate change projections, forecasts and early warnings (AMAP, 2017; AMAP, 2018a; Marshall et al., 2019; Dorn and Zador, 2020; Hollowed et al., 2020; Stram et al., 2021).Figure CCP6.6 | Assessment of feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation options by KR in the polar regions (Table CCP6. 6). Open figure The majority of adaptations in the Arctic are occurring at sub-regional levels in response to both observed and projected climate change, with evidence of increasing regional level action driven by climate planning processes of subnational governments (AMAP, 2017; Labbé et al., 2017; AMAP, 2018a; Canosa et al., 2020). Implemented adaptation includes alterations to building codes and infrastructure design (Shiklomanov et al., 2017; Flynn et al., 2019; Standards Council of Canada, 2020), surveillance (Ruscio et al., 2015; Ford and Clark, 2019; Meredith et al., 2019), information sharing (Berner et al., 2016), changes to survey and monitoring design (Stevenson and Lauth, 2019), hazard mapping (Flynn et al., 2019), use of new technologies (Tejsner and Veldhuis, 2018; Galappaththi et al., 2019), the development of regional and municipal adaptation plans (Labbé et al., 2017), shifting stocks and changes in fishery operations and location (Jørgensen et al., 2019; Fedewa et al., 2020; Thompson et al., 2020), alterations to subsistence harvesting activities (Anderson et al., 2018; Ford et al., 2018; Galappaththi et al., 2019), co-production of knowledge (Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel, 2018) and application of IK for resource management (Robards et al., 2018) and to monitor storms (Rosales et al., 2021; Simonee et al., 2021). Pan-Arctic and national-level adaptation remains limited (Ford et al., 2014; Canosa et al., 2020), although there have been few efforts to examine the nature of adaptation responses in Arctic regions and large gaps in understanding.Illustrative examples of direct and cascading risks, enabling principles of climate resilience pathways, anticipated future conditions (with certainty levels and compounding risks for key sectors within polar regions) are outlined in Table CCP6.6. A list of adaptation options responding directly to the challenges outlined for each sector, including an analysis of adaptation effectiveness and feasibility and cross referenced with KR assessed in this chapter (Table CCP6.5), is provided in Figure CCP6.6.The need for self-determination for Indigenous Peoples and local communities in decision making and cooperation across Arctic nations to manage a rapidly changing Arctic is increasingly recognised, particularly in a shipping and wildlife management context where climate impacts will be transboundary and multi-sectoral (Spence, 2017; Forbis and Hayhoe, 2018; Ford and Clark, 2019; Dawson et al., 2020) (CCP6.2.6; Box CCP6.2). Effective Indigenous and community-led adaptation efforts have been implemented across the Arctic to alleviate climate and non-climate stressors and build resilience through restoration and conservation (Huntington et al., 2017; Brattland and Mustonen, 2018; Hudson and Vodden, 2020; Mustonen and Feodoroff, 2020; Uboni et al., 2020; Huntington et al., 2021). For example, IK and science has been used by the Skolt Sámi in Finland to attenuate warming, drought and water quality impacts on salmonids through restoration of spawning and nursery habitats in the Vainosjoki River catchment (Brattland and Mustonen, 2018; Mustonen and Feodoroff, 2020; Ogar et al., 2020). This ecological restoration of damaged habitats for fish represents community-led actions. In Aasiaat, Greenlandic hunters have implemented community-based oceanographic and ecological monitoring to convey IK observations of rapid change to the government and scientists. A special aspect of land use in the Russian North is the preservation of nomadic lifestyles of the Nenets and Chukchi (Mustonen and Mustonen, 2016), and while these traditional economies have undergone rapid change due to non-climate drivers, their land uses, observational frameworks and cultural matrixes remain of high importance in the context of climate change. Endemic responses (self-agency from within the culture) and Indigenous governance enable adaptation to the rapid and accelerating changes under way (Mustonen et al., 2018a). Therefore, community-based monitoring and inclusion of IK in dialogue with science has been an effective mechanism to detect and respond to climate change.Table CCP6.6 | Assessment of risks needing adaptation by sector in the polar regions.SectorDirect and cascading risksEnabling principles of climate resilience pathwaysAnticipated future conditions/level of certaintyCompounding risks (non-climatic factors)  Coastal settlements(CCP6.2.5)Change in extent of sea ice with more storm surges, thawing of permafrost, SLR and coastal erosionLocal leadership and community-led initiatives to initiate and drive processes, responsive agencies, established processes for assessments and planning, geographic optionsIncreasing number of communities needing relocation (medium confidence), rising costs for mitigating erosion (high confidence)Limitations of government budgets, other disasters that may take priority, policies deficiencies for addressing mitigation and relocationHuman health(CCP6.2.6)Increased food insecurity, waterborne disease, emerging pathogens, injury and death, and negative mental health outcomesResources to support public programmes;
