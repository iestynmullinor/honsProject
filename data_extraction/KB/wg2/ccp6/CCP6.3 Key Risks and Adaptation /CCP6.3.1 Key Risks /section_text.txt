Key risks arising from changing climate hazards are presented in Table CCP6.6 (details in SMCCP6.4). Changing levels and magnitude of climate hazards translate into different levels of risks for ecosystems, industry, society and infrastructure (Figure CCP6.4) (see Meredith et al., 2019 Figures 3.5, 3.10 (Arctic), Figure 3.6 (Antarctic). In the Arctic, these risks are often also shaped by non-climatic factors (Huntington et al., 2019; Ford et al., 2021), including ongoing colonial legacies, land dispossession, landscape fragmentation and resulting challenges in the valuing and meaningful use of IK and LK (Box CCP6.2) (Huntington et al., 2019; Kelman and Næss, 2019; Ford et al., 2020). Available literature enabled assessment of particular polar assets based on projected future risk and including consideration of non-climatic compounding factors under 1°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C global warming above pre-industrial level, including sea ice ecosystems, marine mammals, sea birds, fisheries, infrastructure (Arctic only), local mobility (Arctic only) and coastal erosion (Arctic only) (Figure CCP6.5) (details in SMCCP6.4).Figure CCP6.5 | Burning ember of the relative risks to select assets in the polar regions as a function of global mean surface temperature increase since pre-industrial times including: (1) sea ice ecosystems, (2) marine mammals, (3) sea birds, (4) fisheries, (5) infrastructure (Arctic only), (6) local mobility (Arctic only) and (7) coastal erosion (Arctic only). The supporting literature and methods are provided in SMCCP6.5Open figure Figure CCP6.4 | Rapid assessment for relative risk by sector (y-axis) and climate hazard (x-axis) for polar regions based on an assessment of asset-specific vulnerability and exposure across climate hazards (see SMCCP6. 4 for methodological details). For each unique combination, the hazard by sector risk was ranked as very high (very high risk and high confidence), high (significant impacts and risk, high to medium confidence), medium (impacts are detectable and attributable to climate change, medium confidence) or low/not detected/positive (risk is low or not detectable). Blank cells are those where the assessment was not applicable or not conducted. Risks identified through the rapid assessment were further evaluated in the chapter assessments (see corresponding sector text for full assessment of risk and impacts).Open figure Table CCP6.5 | Key risks (KR) and illustrative examples in polar regions identified through the processes described in Chapter 16 and SMCCP6.4.Key riskDirect and indirect factors contributing to riskKR1. Risk to marine ecosystems and species (CCP6.2.2; CCP6.2.3)Warming, MHW, sea ice loss, glacial and IS melt, OA, invasive species, harmful algae bloomsNarrow thermal niches, altered marine habitat, hampered calcification, higher corrosivity for CaCO3 shell/skeleton, phenological mismatch, physiological/life history effects, sensitive food web relationships, reduced trophic (energy) transfer efficiencies, increased light availability, nutrient limitation, and changes to salinity, stratification, oxygen levelsKR2. Risk to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and species (CCP6.2.4)Warming, hydrological changes, terrestrial heat waves, change in rain and snow events, increased wild- and mega-fire events in Arctic, permafrost thaw, and erosionVegetation browning/greening, narrow thermal niches, physiological/ life history effects, sensitive food web relationships, parasites and diseaseKR3.
