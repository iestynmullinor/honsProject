Polar zones will continue to contract and diminish in extent under climate change, and local adaptations will be insufficient to achieve long-term resilience of polar systems (medium confidence). The pace and extent of change in polar regions is challenging the ability of social and natural systems to adapt (medium confidence). Management of different sectors with specific measures to reduce the potential for compounding risks and the development of climate-sensitive strategies would support the resilience of polar systems. Resilience of natural systems can be enhanced through strategies that maintain ecological connectivity over large spatial scales and reduce the particular impact of local extreme events on biodiversity (medium confidence). {CCP6.2; Box CCP6.1; CCP6.3; Table CCP6.5; Table CCP6.6; Figure CCP6.6; CCP6.4 }Timing, direction and scale of polar climate change impacts differ sub-regionally and will require adaptation strategies that are flexible, equitable, inclusive and integrated across sectors and governance arrangements to effectively reduce risks (high confidence). Governance around climate change planning, preparation and response has been limited in scope, and has often not considered interacting effects of climate change with other risks (high confidence). Reactive management strategies will not succeed in reducing risks in polar regions given the rapid change and increasing potential for extreme events (high confidence). Greater inclusivity of stakeholders and communities, along with using diverse sources of information, including Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge, can benefit robust planning and decision making, and uptake of adaptations (high confidence). Effectiveness in preparing for and adapting to climate risks can benefit from improved climate, weather and ice forecasting services, tools for integrating climate change data and different types of knowledge into management processes and enhanced polar search, rescue and emergency response capabilities (high confidence). {CCP6.2.3.1; CCP6.3; Table CCP6.6; CCP6.4; Box CCP6.2; Box CCP6.3; Figure CCP6.8}
