Climate hazards create risks to transportation sectors with consequences for human safety (very high confidence), security (low confidence) and economic development (high confidence). Remote polar regions are highly reliant on transportation systems (air, road, sea) to support and service communities (Arctic) and scientific stations (Antarctic and Arctic). Changes in permafrost, snow, ice and precipitation patterns have increased the risk of rail infrastructure and of using permanent roads and semi-permanent trails that service Antarctic research stations, connect Arctic communities and support Indigenous food harvesting activities (Calmels et al., 2015; Council of Canadian Academies, 2016; Ford et al., 2019; Stewart et al., 2020). Warming temperatures have particularly decreased the reliability, safety level and season length of winter ice roads (Perrin et al., 2015; Council of Canadian Academies, 2016; GÃ¤deke et al., 2021) in the northern Baltic (Finland) (Kiani et al., 2018), James Bay (Canada) (Hori et al., 2018a; Hori et al., 2018b) and Yakutia (Russia) (Mustonen and Shadrin, 2021 ). Dog sled travel in northwest Greenland has experienced shorter season lengths (Nuttall, 2020), Alaskan whale hunters have had difficulty finding suitable ice for safe harvest activities (Huntington et al., 2016; Nyland et al., 2017), and unpredictability in break-up and freeze-up of sea ice has compromised safe travel to and from culturally significant hunting and camping areas in Canada (Dawson et al., 2020; Simonee et al., 2021) and northeast Siberia (Ksenofontov et al., 2017; Mustonen and Shadrin, 2021 ). Fog (low confidence) and an increase in precipitation falling as ice pellets or hail (high confidence) (Kochtubajda et al., 2017) is expected to continue to cause operational delays and create safety issues for aviation in the polar regions (Debortoli et al., 2019).
