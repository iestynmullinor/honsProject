Polar settlements range from large well-serviced cities such as Tromsø, Murmansk and Reykjavik, to remote fly-in Indigenous communities, to scientific outposts and research stations. Polar settlements are at significant risk from climate change through shoreline erosion, permafrost thaw and flooding (high confidence) (CCP6.2.2). Opportunities for community development in small communities are underestimated as they are emergent and unknown (highly likely ) (CCP6.2.5).Degradation of ice-rich permafrost can threaten the structural stability and functional capacities of community-based infrastructure (i.e., airports and roads; CCP6.2.5) and can have implications for local economies with coupled impacts for local livelihoods, health and well-being (CCP6.2.5, CCP6.2.6) (high confidence). For instance, in Canada, infrastructure damage from permafrost instability caused temporary closures of schools in Yukon, permafrost degradation contributed to runway damage at Iqaluit International Airport in Nunavut, and flooding from heavy rains resulted in thermal erosion of river banks that interrupted water and sewage service in Nunavut (Oldenborger and LeBlanc, 2015; Council of Canadian Academies, 2016; Lemmen et al., 2016). In northeast Siberia, the floods of Alazaeya River attributed to thawing permafrost have severely affected Andreyushkino in Yakutia (Mustonen and Shadrin, 2021 ).By 2050, 69% of fundamental human infrastructure in the Arctic is projected to be at risk under an RCP4.5 scenario, including more than 1200 settlements and 36,000 buildings, leaving 4,000,000 people living in areas with high potential for thaw (Hjort et al., 2018). Widespread permafrost thaw could increase the cost of infrastructure lifecycle replacement by 27% by mid-century under RCP8.5 (Suter et al., 2019). Northern Canada and Western Siberia are at particularly high risk, which are projected to cost additional annual spending of over 1% of annual gross regional product to maintain existing infrastructure (Suter et al., 2019). For instance, under an RCP8.5 scenario, climate change could affect over 19% of structures and infrastructure assets in Russia, which would cost an estimated $84.4 billion USD to mitigate damages (Streletskiy et al., 2019). Fifty-four percent of residential buildings are projected to be affected by significant permafrost degradation by the mid-century, costing an additional estimated $52.6 billion USD (Streletskiy et al., 2019). Sea level rise (SLR) and reduced sea ice protection is projected to compound permafrost thaw damages, including low lying coasts (e.g., along southern Beaufort Sea), low-lying barrier islands (e.g., along Chukchi Sea), and deltas (e.g., Mackenzie, Lena) (Fritz et al., 2017; Lantz et al., 2020). In Alaska, proactive adaptation was substantially cost-saving (reducing costs by $2.9 billion USD for RCP8.5 and $2.3 billion USD for RCP4.5), highlighting the financial benefit of investing in adaptation now (Melvin et al., 2017). Permafrost damage and SLR may result in tipping points, leaving some communities no longer habitable. In Alaska, USA, many communities at risk of flooding and storm surges are already engaged in community-led relocation planning processes (e.g., Shishmaref) (Melvin et al., 2017; Farbotko et al., 2020; Rosales et al., 2021).Climate change has important intangible loss and damage implications in the Arctic, with negative impacts ranging from livelihoods to spirituality to solastalgia (i.e., distress caused by environmental change) (Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018; Middleton et al., 2020b; Sawatzky et al., 2020; Mustonen and Shadrin, 2021 ). Permafrost thaw, SLR and reduced sea ice protection also presents risk to sociocultural assets, including heritage sites in all Arctic regions (very high confidence) (Friesen, 2015; Hollesen et al., 2016; Radosavljevic et al., 2016; O’Rourke, 2017; Hillerdal et al., 2019; Fenger-Nielsen et al., 2020 ; Jensen, 2020). A large number of archaeological sites are at risk from climate change in southwest Greenland; Yukon’s Beaufort coast, Canada; and Auyuittuq National Park Reserve, Nunavut, Canada (Westley et al., 2011; Hollesen et al., 2018; Irrgang et al., 2019; Fenger-Nielsen et al., 2020 ). Siberian nomadic reindeer herding and fishing livelihoods are vulnerable to permafrost thaw, which alters northern landscapes and lakes, as well as rain-on-snow events, and rapidly changes landscapes and terrestrial and aquatic habitats (Mustonen and Mustonen, 2016; Brattland and Mustonen, 2018; Mustonen and Huusari, 2020) (CCP6.2.2). The intangible loss and damage to nomadic cultures could cascade to losses of identity and social challenges (CCP6.2.6; Chapter 13).
