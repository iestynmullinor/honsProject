In Arctic seas, areas with acidification levels corrosive to organisms forming CaCO3 shells or skeletons expanded between the 1990s and 2010 (high confidence), with instances of extreme aragonite under-saturation (Ding et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020). Key species of diatom and picoeukaryote phytoplankton species yet appear relatively resilient to decreasing pH levels over a range of temperature and light conditions (medium confidence) (Table CCP6.2) (Thoisen et al., 2015; Wolf et al., 2018; White et al., 2020). In contrast, there is evidence for species- and stage-specific sensitivities of zooplankton, pteropods and fishes (high confidence) (Table CCP6.2) (Bailey et al., 2016; Dahlke et al., 2018; Thor et al., 2018). Warming, rising river-sediment discharge and coastal erosion in Arctic shelf regions are expected to increase the input of labile, often permafrost-derived organic carbon, the remineralisation of which further increases acidification rates (medium confidence) (Semiletov et al., 2016; AMAP, 2018b; Bröder et al., 2018). Interactions with other physical changes, such as warming or freshening, are expected to aggravate the impacts of ocean acidification (Chapter 3) (Falkenberg et al., 2018).In the Southern Ocean, calcifying organisms are also most vulnerable to ocean acidification (high confidence) (Table CCP6.2), as evidenced by rates of calcification declining by 3.9% between 1998 and 2014 (Freeman and Lovenduski, 2015). Calcifying species with low-magnesium calcite or mechanisms to protect their skeletons are less vulnerable to the corrosive effects of acidification than those using aragonite or high-magnesium calcite (high confidence) (Figuerola et al., 2021). In diatom-dominated communities, silicification diminishes with reduced pH levels, albeit with rates differing among taxa (low confidence) (Petrou et al., 2019). Species-specific responses exist regarding growth and primary production, which are further strongly modulated by iron and light availability (high confidence) (Hoppe et al., 2013; Trimborn et al., 2013; Hoppe et al., 2015; Henley et al., 2020; Seifert et al., 2020). A meta-analysis yielded different CO2 thresholds for Antarctic organismal groups; for example, negative impacts emerged at >1000μ atm CO2 in phytoplankton and at >1500μ atm CO2 in invertebrates, whereas bacterial abundance was positively affected by ocean acidification (Hancock et al., 2020). Species sensitivity can also differ strongly between life-cycle stages (Chapter 3.3.2). For instance, eggs and embryos of Antarctic krill are negatively impacted at >1250μ atm CO2 whereas adults can thrive even at 1000–2000 µatm CO2 over one year (Kawaguchi et al., 2013; Ericson et al., 2018).
