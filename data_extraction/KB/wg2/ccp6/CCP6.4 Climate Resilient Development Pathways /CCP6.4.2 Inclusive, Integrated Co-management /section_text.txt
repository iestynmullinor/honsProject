Inclusive, low-cost participatory decision making can deliver equitable responses to climate change (high confidence). Land use, maritime activities and subsistence fishery and other extracted resources in the polar regions are co-managed through multi-lateral and national government bodies. The capacity of governance systems in some Arctic regions to respond to climate change has strengthened recently (high confidence). Synthetic themes in adaptation for the Arctic have emerged from and since SROCC and include flexibility through diversity in livelihoods, and subsistence and harvest portfolios; co-management of resources; adaptive and ecosystem-based approaches; adoption of advanced technology, forecasts and longer-term projections to improve safety and resources management; and imperative need for low-cost, inclusive and participatory decision making (Kasperski and Holland, 2013; Brattland and Mustonen, 2018; Parlee and Wiber, 2018; Galappaththi et al., 2019; Holsman et al., 2020; Huntington et al., 2021; Melbourne-Thomas et al., 2021; Mustonen and Van Dam, 2021). This was demonstrated in community-level adaptation by Pangnirtung Inuit to climate change impacts on fisheries (Galappaththi et al., 2019). Inclusive approaches to co-management, especially those that enable diverse perspectives, embrace conflict, and address equity and justice across power holders, can help alleviate the risk and promote solutions (Raymond-Yakoubian et al., 2017; Brattland and Mustonen, 2018; Parlee and Wiber, 2018; Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel, 2018; Snook et al., 2020). Integration across levels of management and diverse regional perspectives can reduce climate risks and support equitable adaptation measures (Allison and Bassett, 2015; Raymond-Yakoubian et al., 2017; Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel, 2018; Holsman et al., 2020).Increased flexibility in management measures, greater investment in ecosystem monitoring, and more inclusive participatory methods and communication may help foster high levels of local investment and resilience and promote adaptive pathways (Cinner et al., 2016; Weymouth and Hartz-Karp, 2019), although explicit measures may be needed to reduce costs and increase representation, enhance transparency, embrace dissent and clarify accountability are needed as these are not inherent outcomes (Lynham et al., 2017; Parlee and Wiber, 2018). EBM, which includes provisions aimed at sustaining critical connections within and among social and ecological systems, enhances resilience and attenuates climate impacts on ecosystems and provisioning services; for example, EBM enhances climate resilience for Antarctic krill and Northeast Arctic cod fisheries (Troell et al., 2017; Meyer et al., 2020) and forestalls fishery collapse in the Bering Sea in the near term (Holsman et al., 2020). Increasing likelihood of transboundary resources, interactions and novel commerce may strain existing regulatory and international agreements, suggesting that a priori governance agreements designed to manage climate risks and aimed at attenuating potential conflicts over resources and regions may be important for resolving these issues (Parlee and Wiber, 2018; Mendenhall et al., 2020).
