Polar regions (Figure CCP6.1) are considered flagship areas for climate change, since some of the most extreme climate change impacts that are projected to occur by 2050 elsewhere in the world have already been observed in the Arctic and Antarctic and have resulted in transformative and unprecedented change. Polar regions are not only home to cultural keystone species such as polar bears (Arctic) and penguins (Antarctic) but they also play fundamental roles in regulating the global climate system and in the provision of ecosystem services for the global community and for Arctic Indigenous Peoples and local communities in the region.Figure CCP6.1 | Polar regions include the Arctic, Antarctica, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands and some sub-Arctic areas (e. g., Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands as well as the Fennoscandian and Siberian boreal areas), and all sub-Antarctic areas. This CCP augments the geographical boundaries for the Arctic (Meredith et al., 2019) to also include the sub-Arctic boundary (as defined by the Arctic Biodiversity Assessment), northern boreal areas, parts of the Siberian taiga and southern Labrador. The Antarctic region is delineated along the sub-Antarctic Front (Orsi et al., 1995). Geographic boundaries of the polar regions and important sub-regional locations are displayed, including five marine sectors as defined in the Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean (MEASO), for example, Grant et al., (2021).Open figure These changes are causing a suite of direct and cascading risks for all polar ecosystems with larger effects to date in the Arctic than the Antarctic (high confidence), due to larger and regionally more consistent physical changes (Figure CCP6.2, Table CCP6.1; Chapter 3) (Meredith et al., 2019; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). In the Arctic, these changes affect every sector of society, impacting its 4,000,000 inhabitants, including 400,000 Indigenous People. The Antarctic has no permanent human settlements; however, many nations conduct field research, operate seasonal and permanent stations and have an interest in the management of the region (Hughes et al., 2018; Grant et al., 2021). During summer, when Antarctic science, tourism and fishery activities are greatest, 4400 people live there, whereas only 1100 people live there over winter (Meredith et al., 2019). Although adaptation is occurring in polar regions, it is uneven and sporadic and does not meet the risks posed by future climate change. Indigenous knowledge-based solutions, inclusive ecosystem-based policies and integrated technologies demonstrate the potential to effectively address climate change impacts across scales and sectors, yet implementation barriers remain (CCP6.4.1).Figure CCP6.2 | Observed and projected climate changes across the Arctic (A, C–H) and Antarctic (B, I–N). Boundary lines in each plot are based on the polar regions defined in Figure CCP6.1. All data shown here are extracted from the IPCC WGI Interactive Atlas (Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Iturbide et al., 2021); data set details can be found in the Atlas (https://interactive-atlas.ipcc.ch/). Arctic (A) and Antarctic (B) are observed temperature trends (°C per decade) over land for the period 1980–2015, derived from ERA5 adjusted data set. Projected changes from an ensemble of CMIP6 projections: annual mean temperature over land is depicted for 2°C (C, I) and 4°C (F, L). Global warming levels (GWL) in the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively; annual mean sea surface temperature is depicted for 2°C (D, J) and 4°C (G, M) GWL in the Arctic and Antarctic respectively; annual sea ice (%) is depicted for 2°C (E, K) and 4°C (H, N) GWL in the Arctic and Antarctic, respectively.Open figure This Cross Chapter Paper (CCP) assesses the impacts, risks and adaptation implications resulting from the physical and chemical changes in the polar regions that were detailed in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group I (WGI) contribution to the IPCC 6th Assessment Report (AR6) (IPCC, 2021). Several key WGI AR6 findings have important implications for natural and human systems in polar regions. Warming and wetting have persisted as key climatic impact drivers in polar regions (very high confidence) and will very likely 2  continue to 2100 (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Gulev et al., 2021) with cascading climate effects regarding heatwaves, fire, weather, floods and heavy precipitation, river runoff, snowfall, glaciers and ice sheets (IS), permafrost, lake, river and sea ice, relative sea level and coastal flooding and erosion (Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021) (Table CCP6.1). They represent major climate hazards in all key risks for polar regions (Table CCP6.5). Key points of departure for this CCP also include IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) (IPCC, 2014) and the Polar Regions chapter in the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) (Meredith et al., 2019). SROCC assessed physical, biological and social systems concerning the Arctic and Antarctic Oceans and cryosphere, and how they are affected by current and future climate change. This CCP assesses the rapidly increasing evidence that has been published since AR5 and SROCC, and advances previous IPCC assessments. First, results from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIP6) are an important advance since SROCC, which improve the certainty and resolution of projections of the main climate impact drivers and the risks they have for polar systems (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). Second, building from the framework outlined in SROCC (Crate et al., 2019), scientific, Indigenous knowledge (IK) and local knowledge (LK) systems are included in this assessment. Importantly, Indigenous authors led the assessment of the impacts, adaptation and governance of climate change for Indigenous Peoples, which is an important advance since AR5 and represents an important step towards Indigenous self-determination in international assessment processes (Ford et al., 2012; Ford et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2020).Herein, observed impacts and future risks (CCP6.2), key risks and adaptation (CCP6.3) and climate resilient development pathways (CCP6.4) in the polar regions are assessed. The CCP describes how the implications of climate change impacts in the Arctic and Antarctic extend beyond their boundaries, in terms of transregional coupled ecological systems (CCP6.2.1, CCP6.2.2), global nutritional security (CCP6.2.3), global trade and shipping (CCP6.2.4) and cultural value (CCP6.2.5, CCP6.2.6). Given the synthetic and policy-facing mandate of CCPs and with SROCC as a key point of departure, this CCP is not intended to cover the full breadth of issues for polar regions but rather it highlights select key policy-relevant topics by synthesising and adding value to the relevant material from AR6 sectoral and regional chapters.Table CCP6.1 | Climatic impact drivers  in the Arctic and Antarctic derived from WGI-AR6 chapters (indicated as WGI-9 (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021) and WGI-12 (Ranasinghe et al., 2021)) and Meredith et al.
