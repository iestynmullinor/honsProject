Individuals and households play a central role in adaptation globally. The most frequently reported actors engaged in adaptation-related responses in the scientific literature are individuals and households, particularly in the Global South (Figure 16.4). Regionally, household- and individual-level adaptation is documented most extensively in Africa and Asia, and to a lesser but still substantial extent in North America (Figure 16.4).Figure 16.4 | Who is responding, by geographic region and sector? Cell contents indicate the number of publications reporting engagement of each actor in adaptation-related responses. Darker colours denote a high number of publications. Based on a systematic review of 1682 scientific publications (2013â€“2019) reporting on adaptation-related responses in human systems (Berrang-Ford et al., 2021a). SIS, Small Island States; Terr, terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems.Open figure National and local governments are also frequently engaged in reported adaptation across most regions. In Africa and Asia, reported adaptations have been primarily associated with individuals, households, national governments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and international institutions, with more limited reporting of involvement from sub-national governments or the private sector (Ford et al., 2015a; Ford and King, 2015; Hunter et al., 2020). Engagement by sub-national governments in adaptation is more frequently documented in Europe and North America (Craft and Howlett, 2013; Craft et al., 2013; Bauer and Steurer, 2014; Lesnikowski et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015; Austin et al., 2016). Reporting of private sector engagement is generally low. Civil society participation in adaptations is reported across all regions. Consistent with this, local governments are also widely reported in documented adaptation responses, particularly where municipal jurisdiction is high, including cities, infrastructure, water and sanitation.
