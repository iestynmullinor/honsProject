While the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5) has pointed to this connection of risks across regions as ‘cross-regional phenomena’ (Hewitson et al., 2014), only a few countries so far have integrated inter-regional aspects into their climate change risks assessments (Liverman, 2016; Surminski et al., 2016; Adams et al., 2020), and adaptation is still framed as a predominantly national or local issue (Dzebo and Stripple, 2015; Benzie and Persson, 2019 ).Inter-regional risks from climate change—also called cross-border, transboundary, transnational or indirect risks—are risks that are transmitted across borders (e.g., transboundary water use) and/or via teleconnections (e.g., supply chains, global food markets) (Moser and Hart, 2015). The risks can result from impacts, including compound or concurrent impacts, that cascade across several tiers, in ways that either diminish or escalate risk within international systems (Carter et al., 2021). Risk transmission may occur through trade and finance networks, flows of people (Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7), biophysical flows (natural resources such as water) and ecosystem connections. However, not only risks are transmitted across borders and systems; the adaptation response may also reduce risks at the origin of the risk, along the transmission channel or at the recipient of the risk (Carter et al., 2021). This cross-chapter box discusses four inter-regional risk channels (trade, finance, food and ecosystems) and how adaptation can govern these risks.TradeMost commodities are traded on global markets, and supply chains have become increasingly globalised. For instance, specialised industrial commodities such as semiconductors are geographically concentrated in a few countries (Challinor et al., 2017; Liverman, 2016). When climatic events like flooding or heat affect the location of these extraction and production activities, economies are not only disrupted locally but also across borders and in distant countries (high confidence), as exemplified by the Thailand flood 2011 that led to a shortage of key inputs to the automotive and electronics industry not only in Thailand but also in Japan, Europe and the USA (Figure Cross-Chapter Box INTEREG.1). For many industrialised countries like the UK, Japan, the USA and the European Union, there is increasing evidence that the trade impacts of climate change are significant and can have substantial domestic impacts (medium confidence) (Nakano, 2017; Willner et al., 2018, Section 13.9.1; Benzie and Persson, 2019 ; Knittel et al., 2020). Enhanced trade can transmit risks across borders and thereby amplify damages (Wenz and Levermann, 2016), but it can also increase resilience (Lim-Camacho et al., 2017; Willner et al., 2018).Figure Cross-Chapter Box INTEREG.1 | Inter-regional climate risks: the example of the trade transmission channel, illustrated for the Thailand flood 2011 (Abe and Ye, 2013; Haraguchi and Lall, 2015; Carter et al., 2021. , 2021). Open figure FinanceClimate risks can also spread through global financial markets (Mandel et al., 2021). For the case of coastal and riverine flooding with low adaptation 2080 (RCP 8.5-SSP5), the financial system is projected to amplify direct losses by a factor of 2 (global average), but reach up to a factor of 10 for countries that are central financial hubs (Mandel et al., 2021, Figure 13.28). Indirect impacts may also arise through indirect effects on foreign direct investment, remittance flows and official development assistance (Hedlund et al., 2018).FoodThe global supply of agricultural products is concentrated to a few main breadbaskets (Bren d’Amour et al., 2016; Gaupp et al., 2020, Chapter 5). For instance, Central and South America is one of the regions with the highest potential to increase food supplies to more densely populated regions in Asia, the Middle East and Europe (Chapter 12). The exports of agricultural commodities (coffee, bananas, sugar, soybean, corn, sugarcane, beef livestock) have gained importance in the past two decades as international trade and globalisation of markets have shaped the global agri-food system (Chapter 5).The export of major food crops like wheat, maize and soybeans from many of the world’s water-scarce area—the Middle East, North Africa, parts of South Asia, North China Plains, southwest USA, Australia—to relatively water-abundant parts of the world carries a high virtual water content (the net volume of water embedded in trade) (high confidence) (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012; Dalin et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019, Chapter 4). Both importing and exporting countries are exposed to transboundary risk transmission through climate change impacts on distant water resources (Sartori et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Ercin et al., 2021). Climate change is projected to exacerbate risk and add new vulnerabilities for risk transmission (medium confidence). Rising atmospheric CO2 concentration is projected to decrease water efficiency of growing maize and temperate cereal crops in parts of the USA, East and Mediterranean Europe, South Africa, Argentina, Australia and Southeast Asia, with important implications for future trade in food grains (Fader et al., 2010). By 2050 (SRES B2 scenario), virtual water importing countries in Africa and the Middle East may be exposed to imported water stress as they rely on imports of food grains from countries which have unsustainable water use (Sartori et al., 2017). Until 2100, virtual trade in irrigation water is projected to almost triple (for SSP2-RCP6.5 scenarios) and the direction of virtual water flows is projected to reverse, with the currently exporting regions like South Asia becoming importers of virtual water (Graham et al., 2020). An additional 10–120% trade flow from water-abundant regions to water-scarce regions will be needed to sustain environmental flow requirements on a global scale by the end of the century (Pastor et al., 2019). Exports of agricultural commodities contribute to deforestation, over-exploitation of natural resources and pollution, affecting the natural capital base and ecosystem services (Agarwala and Coyle, 2020; Rabin et al., 2020, Section 12.5.4).Species and ecosystemsThe spatial distributions of species on land and in the oceans are shifting due to climate change, with these changes projected to accelerate at higher levels of global warming (Pecl et al., 2017). These ‘species on the move’ have large effects on ecosystems and human well-being, and present challenges for governance (Pecl et al., 2017). For example, the number of transboundary fish stocks is projected to increase as key fisheries species are displaced by ocean warming (Pinsky et al., 2018). Conflict over shifting mackerel fisheries has already occurred between European countries (Spijkers and Boonstra, 2017), because few regulatory bodies have clear policies on shifting stocks; this leaves species open to unsustainable exploitation in new waters in the absence of regularly updated catch allocations to reflect changing stock distributions (Caddell, 2018).Human health will also be affected as vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue shift geographic distributions (Caminade et al., 2014). There is also evidence that many warm-adapted invasive species, such as invasive freshwater cyanobacterium, have spread to higher latitudes because of climate change (Chapter 2).Adaptation to inter-regional climate risksAdaptation responses to reduce inter-regional risks can be implemented at a range of scales: at the point of the initial climate change impact (e.g., assistance for recovery after an extreme event, development of resilient infrastructure, climate-smart technologies for agriculture); at or along the pathway via which impacts are transmitted to the eventual recipient (e.g., trade diversification, re-routing of transport); in the recipient country (e.g., increasing storage to buffer supply disruptions), or by third parties (e.g., adaptation finance, technology transfer) (Bren d’Amour et al., 2016; Carter et al., 2021; Talebian et al., 2021). A knowledge gap exits on the need for, effectiveness of, and limits to adaptation under different socioeconomic and land use futures.Due to regional and global interdependencies, climate resilience has a global, multi-level public good character (Banda, 2018). The benefits of adaptation are therefore shared beyond the places where adaptation is initially implemented. Conversely, adaptation may be successful at a local level while redistributing vulnerability elsewhere or even driving or exacerbating risks in other places (Atteridge and Remling, 2018). International cooperation is therefore needed to ensure that inter-regional effects are considered in adaptation and that adaptation efforts are coordinated to avoid maladaptation. However, regional- and global-scale governance of adaptation is only just beginning to emerge (Persson, 2019).The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement frames adaptation as a ‘global challenge’ (Article 7.2) and establishes the global goal on adaptation (Article 7.1), which provides space for dialogue between parties on the global-scale challenge of adaptation and the need for renewed political and financial investment in adaptation, including to address inter-regional effects (Benzie et al., 2018).National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) can evolve to consider inter-regional effects as well as domestic ones (Liverman, 2016; Surminski et al., 2016; European Environment, 2020). Regional and international coordination of NAPs, coupled with building capacities and addressing existing knowledge gaps at the country level, can help to ensure that resources are oriented towards reducing inter-regional risks and building systemic resilience to climate change globally (Booth et al., 2020; Wijenayake et al., 2020).Given the important role of private actors in managing inter-regional climate risks (Goldstein et al., 2019; Tenggren et al., 2019), efforts will be needed to align public and private strategies for managing inter-regional climate risks to avoid maladaptation and ensure just and equitable adaptation at different scales (Talebian et al., 2021).Cross-Chapter Box INTEREGCross-Chapter Box INTEREGCross-Chapter Box INTEREG
