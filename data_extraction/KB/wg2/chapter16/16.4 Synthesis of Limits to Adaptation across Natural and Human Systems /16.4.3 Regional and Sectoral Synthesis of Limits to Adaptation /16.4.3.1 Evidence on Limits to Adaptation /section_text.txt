There is high agreement  and medium evidence that there are limits to adaptation across regions and sectors. However, much of the available evidence focuses on constraints that may lead to limits at some point with little detailed information on how limits may be related to different levels of socioeconomic or environmental change (high confidence). Figure 16.7 assesses evidence on constraints and limits for broad categories of region and sector. Small islands and Central and South America show most evidence of constraints being linked to adaptation limits across sectors, while ocean and coastal ecosystems and health, well-being and communities show most evidence of constraints being linked to limits across regions (medium confidence). Figure 16.7 | Evidence on constraints and limits to adaptation by region and sector. Data from Thomas et al. (2021), based on 1682 scientific publications reporting on adaptation-related responses in human systems. See SM16.1 for methods. Low evidence: <20% of assessed literature has information on limits; literature mostly focuses on constraints to adaptation. Medium evidence:  between 20% and 40% of assessed literature has information on limits; literature provides some evidence of constraints being linked to limits. High evidence: >40% of assessed literature has information on limits; literature provides broad evidence of constraints being linked to limits.Open figure There are clusters of evidence with additional details on limits to adaptation, as detailed in Table 16.3. Evidence on limits to adaptation is largely focused on terrestrial and aquatic species and ecosystems, coastal communities, water security, agricultural production, and human health and heat (high confidence).Beginning at 1.5°C, autonomous and evolutionary adaptation responses by terrestrial and aquatic species and ecosystems face hard limits, resulting in biodiversity decline, species extinction and loss of related livelihoods (high confidence). Interventionist adaptation strategies to reduce risks for species and ecosystems face soft limits due to governance, financial and knowledge constraints (medium confidence). As sea levels rise and extreme events intensify, coastal communities face soft limits due to financial, institutional and socioeconomic constraints reducing the efficacy of coastal protection and accommodation approaches and resulting in loss of life and economic damages (medium confidence). Hard limits for coastal communities reliant on nature-based coastal protection will be experienced beginning at 1.5°C (medium confidence).Beginning at 3°C, hard limits are projected for water management measures, leading to decreased water quality and availability, negative impacts on health and well-being, economic losses in water and energy dependent sectors and potential migration of communities (medium confidence).Soft and hard limits for agricultural production are related to water availability and the uptake and effectiveness of climate-resilient crops, which is constrained by socioeconomic and political challenges (medium confidence). Adaptation measures to address risks of heat stress, heat mortality and reduced capacities for outdoor work for humans face soft and hard limits across regions beginning at 1.5°C and are particularly relevant for regions with warm climates (high confidence).Table 16.3 | Adaptation limits and residual risks for select actors and systems.
