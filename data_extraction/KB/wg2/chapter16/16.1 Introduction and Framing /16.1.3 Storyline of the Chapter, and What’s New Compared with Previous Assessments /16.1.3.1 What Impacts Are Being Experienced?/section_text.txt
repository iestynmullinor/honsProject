This assessment of climate-related impacts that are already taking place is covered in Section 16.2, which aims to differentiate between observed changes in climate hazards (also called ‘climate impact drivers’ in IPCC Working Group I) and the exposure and vulnerability of human and ecological systems.Observed impacts of climate change were synthesised in the TAR, AR4 and AR5. The TAR found that recent regional climate changes had already affected many physical and biological systems, with preliminary indications that some human systems had been affected, primarily through floods and droughts. AR4 found likely 2  discernible impacts on many physical and biological systems, and more limited evidence for impacts on human environments. AR5 devoted a separate chapter to observed impacts, which found growing evidence of impacts on human and ecological systems on all continents and across oceans (Cramer et al., 2014).Section 16.2 reports on the expanded literature since then, generally reflecting a growing and more certain impact of climate change on humans and ecological systems.
