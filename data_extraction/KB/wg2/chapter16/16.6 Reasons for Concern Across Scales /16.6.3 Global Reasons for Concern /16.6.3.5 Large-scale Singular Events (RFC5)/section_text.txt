This RFC, large-scale singular events (sometimes called tipping points or critical thresholds), considers abrupt, drastic and sometimes irreversible changes in physical, ecological or social systems in response to smooth variations in driving forces (accompanied by natural variability) (Oppenheimer et al., 2014; O’Neill et al., 2017). SR15 Section 3.5.2.5 presented four examples, including the cryosphere (West Antarctic ice sheet, Greenland ice sheet), thermohaline circulation (slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation), the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a global mode of climate variability, and the role of the Southern Ocean in the global carbon cycle (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018b). While most of the literature assessed here focuses on the resultant changes to climate-related hazards such as sea level rise, in this assessment, evidence about the implications of accelerated sea level rise for human and natural systems is also considered. If sea level rise is accelerated by ice sheet melt, the associated impacts are projected to occur decades earlier than otherwise, directly affecting coastal systems including cities and settlements by the sea (CCP2) and wetlands (Chapter 2). The associated disruption to ports is projected to severely compromise global supply chains and maritime trade with local–global geo-political and economic consequences. To compensate for this acceleration, adaptation would need to occur much faster and at a much greater scale than otherwise, or indeed than has previously been observed (CCP2). The costs of accommodating port growth and adapting to sea level rise amount to USD 22–768 billion before 2050 globally (medium evidence, high agreement ) (see Sections 2.1, 2.2; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3).In AR5 Section 19.6.3.6 (Oppenheimer et al., 2014), the boundary between undetectable and moderate risk is set at levels between 0.6°C and 1.6°C above pre-industrial levels (i.e., 0°C and 1°C above the 1986–2005 level) with high confidence, based on emerging early-warning signals of regime shifts in Arctic and warm water coral reef systems. The risk transition boundary between moderate and high risk was set between 1.6°C and 3.6°C above pre-industrial levels (i.e., 1°C and 3°C above the 1986–2005 level), with medium confidence based on projections of ice sheet loss, with faster increase between 1°C and 2°C than between 2°C and 3°C. The literature available at the time did not allow AR5 to assess the boundary between high and very high risk.In SR15 Section 3.5.2.5 (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018b), new assessments of the potential collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet (WAIS) initiated by marine ice sheet instability (MISI) resulted in lowering the upper end of the transition from undetectable and moderate risk from 1.6°C to 1°C warming above pre-industrial levels, and lowering the upper end of the transition from moderate to high risk to 2.5°C. Although SR15 did not produce embers beyond 2.5°C, authors reported that the transition to very high risk was assessed as lying above 5°C in light of growing literature on ice sheet contributions to SLR.AR6 provides new evidence that relates to the location of the transition from undetectable to moderate risk. At the time of SR15, observations were suggesting that MISI might already be taking place in some parts of the WAIS, while AR5 supported assessment of an additional MISI contribution to SLR of several additional tenths of a metre over the next two centuries. Since SR15, new observations (WGI AR6 Section 9.4.2.1, Fox-Kemper et al., 2021) support the assessment of enhanced grounding line retreat and subsequent mass loss through basal melt in various parts of Antarctica, and year 2100 sea level projections for the RCP8.5 scenario have increased by 10–12 cm owing to ice dynamics. However, the onset of MISI is driven by ocean warming in specific locations (ice cavities beneath floating ice shelves), and the relation between these ocean temperatures and global mean temperature is indirect and ambiguous. In addition, MISI implies a self-sustaining instability in the absence of further forcing. Because forcing is still increasing, it cannot be unambiguously assessed whether MISI is driving the observed retreat of grounding lines in the WAIS, or whether this retreat is a purely forced response (and would stop if the warming stops) or is just a manifestation of natural variability in upwelling of warmer waters on the Antarctic continental shelves and, as a result, is just a temporary effect. Consistent with SROCC, AR6 states with medium confidence that sustained mass losses of several major glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) are compatible with the onset of MISI, but that whether unstable WAIS retreat has already begun or is imminent remains a critical uncertainty.Whether associated with MISI or not, WGI AR6 (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021) now assesses with very high confidence that mass loss from both the Antarctic (whether associated with MISI or not) and Greenland Ice Sheets, is more than seven times higher over the period 2010–2016 than over the period 1992–1999 for Greenland and four times higher for the same time intervals for Antarctica. Given their multi-century commitments to global SLR, this reinforces the assessment of estimating the boundary between undetectable and moderate risks for ice sheets to lie between 0.7°C (the level of global warming in the 1990s when melting began to accelerate) and 1°C (as in SR15), with a median of 0.9°C.In the Amazon Forest, increases in tree mortality and a decline in the carbon sink are already reported (Brienen et al., 2015; Hubau et al., 2020), and old-growth Amazon Rainforest may have become a net carbon source for the period 2010–2019 (Qin et al., 2021). Estimates which include land use emissions indicate the region may have become a net carbon source (Gatti et al., 2021). Fire activity is an important driver, and both bigger fires (Lizundia-Loiola et al., 2020) and longer fire season (Jolly et al., 2015) have been reported in South America, although this is strongly linked to land use and land use change as well as climate (Kelley et al., 2021), and indeed land use change may be a stronger driver of potential loss of the Amazon Forest than climate change. The risk of climate-change-related loss of the Amazon Forest is assessed already above ‘undetectable’, but has only emerged over the last few years, when global warming had reached 1°C, and is linked to land use as well as GSAT levels. Chapter 2 has assessed ecosystem carbon loss from tipping points in tropical forest and loss of Arctic permafrost, and finds a transition to moderate risk over the range 0.6–0.9°C (medium confidence). Specifically, WGII AR6 Table SM2.5 finds that ‘Primary tropical forest comprised a net source of carbon to the atmosphere, 2001–2019 (emissions 0.6 Gt y −1, net 0.1 Gt y −1) (Harris et al., 2021). Anthropogenic climate change has thawed Arctic permafrost (Guo et al., 2020), carbon emissions 1.7 ± 0.8 Gt y −1, 2003–2017 (Natali et al., 2019)’. This also supports the upper limit for this transition lying at 1°C.The potential global loss of an entire ecosystem type, coral reefs, is also considered a large-scale singular event. In the 1990s when global warming was around 0.7°C large-scale coral reef bleaching also became apparent (Section 16.2.3.1), also supporting the lower boundary for this transition in respect of coral reefs.Overall, given the above evidence on ice sheets, Amazon Forest and coral reefs, the transition from undetectable to moderate risk is assessed to occur between 0.7°C and 1°C warming with a median of 0.9°C with high confidence.The transition from moderate to high risk is informed by an assessment of risks at higher levels of warming than present. Nearly all climate models show warmer temperatures around Antarctica in conjunction with rising global mean temperature, and all ice sheet models show sustained mass loss from the WAIS after temperature increase halts (thus implying MISI takes place) at various levels between 1.5°C and 5°C. An increasing fraction of ice sheet models shows additional sustained mass loss from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) for peak warming between 2°C and 4°C, and all ice sheet models show mass loss for peak warming higher than 4°C. Therefore, we assess an increasing link between MISI, WAIS collapse and Antarctic mass loss, for increasing temperature levels (high confidence).There is high confidence in the existence of threshold behaviour of the Greenland Ice Sheet in a warmer climate (WGI AR6 Ch 9, Fox-Kemper et al., 2021); however, there is low agreement  on the nature of the thresholds and the associated tipping points. Similarly, the likelihood for accelerated and irreversible mass loss from Antarctica increases with increasing temperatures, but thresholds cannot yet be unambiguously identified. By the year 2100, sea level projections (AR6 WGI Figure SPM.8 (IPCC, 2021)) now range from 0.57 m (0.37–0.85 m) for the SSP1–1.9 scenario to 1.35 m (1.02–1.89 m) for the SS5–8.5 scenario and become 1.99 m for the latter scenario (1.02–4.83 m) in the case of low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes resulting from ice sheet instability, for which there is limited evidence. It should be noted that inclusion of such low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes dominated by not-well-understood processes affecting ice dynamics on the large ice caps of Greenland, and in particular Antarctica, would also enhance the sea level projections for other scenarios, but to a lesser extent for increasingly weaker forcing. No quantitative assessment of their effect in other scenarios than SSP5–8.5 yet exists as such simulations with ice sheet models have not been carried out, or only in a very limited amount.It should be noted that ice sheets may take many centuries to respond, implying that risk levels increase over time for the same warming level. Therefore, we base judgements about risk transitions related to ice sheets primarily on their implications for 2000-year commitments to SLR from sustained mass loss from both ice sheets as projected by various ice sheet models, reaching 2.3–3.1 m at 1.5°C peak warming and 2–6 m at 2.0°C peak warming (WGI AR6 TS, Box TS.4 Figure 1; Arias et al., 2021). This is an important feature of the approach to this RFC (i.e., it is not primarily focused on implications for the next 100–200 years). In addition, since the AR5, there is new evidence about the Last Interglacial (LIG), when global mean temperature was about 0.5–1.5°C above the pre-industrial era. AR6 assesses that it is virtually certain that sea level was higher than today at that time, likely  by 5–10 m (medium confidence) (B.5.4 WGI AR6 SPM,(IPCC, 2021)). Mid-Pliocene temperatures of 2.5°C (about 3 million years ago when global temperatures were 2.5–4°C higher) also provide evidence as an upper limit for the transition to high risk associated with long-term equilibrium SLR of 5–25 m (WGI AR6 SPM B.5.4). Projected SLR for 2300 in an RCP8.5 or SSP5–8.5 scenario (consistent with a peak warming range of 4–6°C, varies between 1.7–6.8 m and 2.2–5.9 m, respectively (WGI AR6 TS Box TS.4, Arias et al., 2021), and when accounting for marine ice cliff instability taking place on Antarctica, these numbers may increase to a range of 9.5–16.2 m (WGI AR6 TS Box TS.4, Arias et al., 2021).CMIP6 climate models project drying in the Amazon—especially in June–July–August, irrespective of future forcing scenario, but which increases with GSAT/higher scenarios (Lee et al., 2021). For higher GSAT levels, Burton et al. (2021) explore different forcing scenarios and found, regardless of scenario, burned area increases markedly with GSAT. New understanding of the role of vegetation stomata will act to exacerbate this drying (Richardson et al., 2018b). A transition to high risk of savannisation for the Amazon alone was assessed to lie between 1.5°C and 3°C with a median value of 2.0°C. A mean temperature increase of 2°C could reduce Arctic permafrost area ~15% by 2100 (Comyn-Platt et al., 2018). Chapter 2 has assessed ecosystem carbon loss from tipping points in tropical forest and loss of Arctic permafrost, and finds a transition from moderate to high risk over the range 1.5°C to 3°C with a median of 2°C (medium confidence, Table SM2.5, Figure 2.11). Its assessment of the transition from high to very high risk is located over the range 3–5°C (low confidence, Table SM2.5, Figure 2.11) based on the potential for Amazon Forest dieback between 4°C and 5°C temperature increase above the pre-industrial period (Salazar and Nobre, 2010).One of the criteria for locating a transition to very high risk is a limited ability to adapt. In natural systems, limiting warming to 1.5°C rather than 2°C would enhance the ability of coastal wetlands to adapt naturally to SLR, since natural sedimentation rates more likely keep up with SLR (SR15, Hoegh-Guldberg 2018). In human systems, there is medium confidence that technical limits will be reached for hard protection to SLR beyond 2100 under high-emissions scenarios, with limits associated with socioeconomic and governance issues reached before 2100 (CCP2).We therefore estimate the boundary between moderate and high risk to lie between 1.5°C and 2.5°C, with a median at 2.0°C, with medium confidence based on projections for melting ice sheets and drying in the Amazon. We also estimate the boundary between high and very high risk to lie between 2.5°C and 4°C, but with low confidence due to uncertainties in the projections of SLR at higher levels of warming and differences between levels of warming at which very high risks were assessed in different systems.
