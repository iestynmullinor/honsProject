The RFC assessment reflects the latest understanding of warming reported in WGI AR6. Global surface temperature was 1.09 [0.95 to 1.20]°C higher in 2011–2020 than 1850–1900, with stronger warming over land (1.59 [1.34 to 1.83]°C) than over the ocean (0.88 [0.68 to 1.01]°C) (WGI AR6 Cross Chapter Box 2.3 Table 1, Eyring et al. in Gulev et al., 2021). Warming levels are commonly reported and studied in the impacts literature using two scales of spatially averaged temperature rise, global surface air temperature (GSAT), commonly produced by General Circulation Models (GCMs) when projecting climate changes, and global mean surface temperature (GMST), commonly used in empirical studies. Both have the same reference point of pre-industrial of 1850–1900. The ember diagrams presented here use GSAT, which is consistent with most literature of projected risk (largely based on the output of climate models). To the extent that the embers also draw on the observed impacts literature using GMST, this potential variation is minimal as the average levels of GSAT and GMST have been shown to match closely (for further discussion on this, see Cross-Chapter Box CLIMATE in Chapter 1). Hence, the diagrams are presented with a single y-axis representing global temperature change, generally referring to global temperature rise irrespective of when it occurs; however, the majority of the literature assessed considers alternative levels of warming during the 21st century. For example, a warming level of 2°C might occur in the 2050s, in the 2080s or in 2100 (see next section).Furthermore, climate-related hazards associated with each of the RFCs are assessed in WGI AR6 Cross-Chapter Box 12.1 Table 1 (Tebaldi et al., 2021), which synthesises information from various chapters of WGI on 35 such hazards according to global warming levels (GWLs) to inform understanding of their potential changes and associated risks with temperature levels in general.
