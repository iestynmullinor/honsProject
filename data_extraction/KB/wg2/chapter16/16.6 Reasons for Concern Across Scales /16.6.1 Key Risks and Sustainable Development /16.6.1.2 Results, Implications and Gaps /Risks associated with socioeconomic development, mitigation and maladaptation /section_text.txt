The ember diagrams in Figure 16. 15 capture only the risks arising from exposure of vulnerable socio-ecological systems to climatic hazards across a range of socioeconomic futures. They do not capture any risk component arising solely from changes in population or level of development. Importantly, they also do not capture additional risks that may arise from the human response to climate change, including climate change mitigation or unintended negative consequences of adaptation-related responses (i.e., maladaptation) (Section 17.5.1). Such risks are discussed in SRCCL Chapter 7, for example, adverse effects of the very large-scale use of land and water for primary bioenergy production on food production and biodiversity (Hurlbert et al., 2019). Contributions of mitigation or maladaptation to risk can be important, however, and are discussed further in the context of specific RFCs in Section 16.6.3. In general, such components of risk are difficult to quantify, and can be minimised by good design of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Thus, the effect is excluded from the ember diagrams to allow a clearer representation of the accrual of climate change risk with global warming.
