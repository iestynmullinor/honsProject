The RFC framework communicates scientific understanding about accrual of risk in relation to varying levels of warming for five broad categories: risk associated with (1) unique and threatened systems, (2) extreme weather events, (3) distribution of impacts, (4) global aggregate impacts and (5) large-scale singular events (Smith et al., 2001; Mastrandrea and Schneider, 2004; Schneider and Mastrandrea, 2005). The RFC framework was first developed during the Third Assessment Report (Smith et al., 2001) along with a visual representation of these risks as ‘burning embers’ figures, and this assessment framework has been further developed and updated in subsequent IPCC reports including AR5 (IPCC, 2014; Oppenheimer et al., 2014) and the recent IPCC Special Reports (SR15 (IPCC, 2018a); SRCCL (IPCC, 2019; SROCC (IPCC, 2019)).
