Resilience in this report is defined as the capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure, while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation (see Annex II: Glossary). Resilience is an entry point commonly used, although under a wide spectrum of meanings (Reghezza-Zitt et al., 2012; Flood and Schechtman, 2014; Aldunce et al., 2015; Tanner et al., 2015; Fisichelli et al., 2016; Meerow et al., 2016; Moser et al., 2019a). Resilience as a system trait overlaps with concepts of vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and thereby risk. Resilience as a strategy overlaps with risk management, adaptation and also transformation (Woodruff et al., 2018; Moser et al., 2019a). Implemented adaptation is often organised around resilience as bouncing back and returning to a previous state after a disturbance (Fisichelli et al., 2016).In much of the literature, resilience encompasses not just maintaining essential function, identity and structure, but also maintaining a capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation. Since the earliest framings of resilience around stability and persistence, ecology and allied fields have come to recognise that while systems are often persistent in the face of disturbance, disturbance also creates opportunity for transformation and the emergence of new pathways (Section 1.5.2; Folke, 2006; Allen and Holling, 2010; Folke et al., 2010; Gelcich et al., 2010; Stockholm Resilience Center, 2015; Doppelt, 2017). Across this literature, disturbance is framed as outside the system in question, for which the time frames and spatial scales of disturbances, impacts and responses are central to outcomes (Béné et al., 2011; Brown, 2014; Hamborg et al., 2020). Endogenous processes of transformation are presented as emergent, characterised by thresholds and, as a result, very difficult to anticipate (Scheffer et al., 2001; Walker and Meyers, 2004; Suding and Hobbs, 2009; Scheffer et al., 2012; Hughes et al., 2013; Scheffer et al., 2015). In the last 5 years (2016–2020), the concept of resilience has gained prominence as a core theme in the climate change adaptation literature (Nalau and Verrall, 2021).Often, development and adaptation communities of practice default to persistence and stability in their use of resilience (Cote and Nightingale, 2012; MacKinnon and Derickson, 2013). Such a framing aligns resilience with a long-standing but increasingly questioned belief that sustainable development can be achieved through incremental adjustments in behaviour and advances in technology that allow for the persistence of existing socioeconomic and socio-ecological arrangements (Klauer, 1999; Banerjee, 2003; Redclift, 2005; UN Inter-agency Task Force on Financing for Development 2019; Chapter 18, Section 1.5). However, the literature increasingly suggests that the achievement of sustainable development will require transformative change in socio-ecological systems at scales ranging from the community to the globe. The concept of climate resilient development, initially introduced in AR5 and now a key focus in this report (see Chapter 18), engages with such transformations and the associated questions of justice, power and politics as shaped by internal, endogenous social factors and their interactions with other drivers of change (Eriksen et al., 2015; Nightingale, 2015b; Carr, 2019; Nightingale et al., 2019; see also Chapter 18).
