Adaptation in this report is defined, in human systems, as the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, adaptation is the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects (see Annex II: Glossary). Adaptation planning in human systems generally entails a process of iterative risk management. Different types of adaptation have been distinguished, including anticipatory versus reactive, autonomous versus planned and incremental versus transformational adaptation (Chapters 16–18; IPCC WGII glossaries for the TAR, AR4, AR5, and AR6 (Annex II)). Adaptation is often seen as having five general stages: (a) awareness, (b) assessment, (c) planning, (d) implementation and (e) M&E (Moser and Boykoff, 2013; Jones et al., 2014; Mimura et al., 2014; Noble et al., 2014; see also Section 17.4). Government, non-government and private sector actors have adopted a wide variety of specific approaches to adaptation that, to varying degrees, address these five general stages. Adaptation in natural systems includes ‘autonomous’ adjustments through ecological and evolutionary processes. It also involves the use of nature through ecosystem-based adaptation. The role of species, biodiversity and ecosystems in such adaptation options can range from the rehabilitation or restoration of ecosystems (e.g., wetlands or mangroves) to hybrid combinations of ‘green and grey’ infrastructure (e.g., horizontal levees) (Chapters 2 and 3; IPBES, 2018).The IPCC assessment of adaptation has evolved through time. The WGII AR4 included one chapter dedicated to adaptation, the WGII AR5 expanded to four and the WGII AR6 mainstreams adaptation comprehensively throughout the report. Adaptation science is rapidly evolving, including evaluation of adaptation effectiveness, feasibility, implementation and maladaptation, although major knowledge gaps persist in modelling and analysis (Cross-Chapter Box ADAPT in Chapter 1; Chapter 16; Section 1.4; Holman et al., 2019). The WGII AR6 emphasises assessment of observed adaptation-related responses to climate change, governance and decision making in adaptation, and the role of adaptation in reducing key risks and global-scale reasons for concern, as well as limits to such adaptation (e.g., Chapters 16 and 17). The assessment approach includes adaptation needs, options, planning and implementation across sectors and regions, as well as adaptation opportunities, constraints and also limits (Eisenack et al., 2014; Klein et al., 2014b; Oberlack and Eisenack, 2014; Lehmann et al., 2015; Roggero, 2015; Herrmann and Guenther, 2017; Oberlack, 2017; Sieber et al., 2018; Moser et al., 2019b; Capela Lourenço et al., 2019; Thaler et al., 2019; Russel et al., 2020; see also Chapters 16 and 17).Since AR5, more adaptation has progressed (IPCC, 2014a; Lesnikowski et al., 2016; see also Sections 16.2.5 and 17.2) and the focus of activity has expanded to include social, institutional and governance dimensions beyond engineered and technical options and to decision processes beyond technocratic, linear framings (IPCC, 2014a; see also Chapter 17). Adaptation includes increasing attention to implementation, M&E and learning through time, not just planning processes (Section 17.3 and 17.5.1). On the one hand, an important advance has been recognition of generalised capacities, such as resources and knowledge, necessary for the feasibility of effective adaptation. Adaptation thereby strongly overlaps with risk management and with the building of resilience and sustainable development (Chapters 17 and 18).
