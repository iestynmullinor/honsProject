The IPCC mandate involves the provisioning of available scientific information and evidence to inform climate action by multiple actors, notably governments (including international alliances) in the context of UNFCCC. Increasingly, IPCC assessments also aim to provide valuable information to non-governmental organisations, small and large enterprises, and citizens.Figure 1.10 shows the structure of this report, organised into three sections comprising chapters and cross-chapter papers. This first chapter provides the point of departure for this assessment, defines key concepts and describes the connections among them.Figure 1.10 | Structure of the Working Group II Sixth Assessment Report Open figure The next group of chapters assess risks, adaptation and sustainability for systems impacted by climate change from the vantage of seven sectoral chapters, The next group of chapters organises the assessment from the vantage of seven regional chapters.In contrast to previous assessments, the current report embeds adaptation in each regional and sectoral chapter rather than in separate adaptation chapters, in order to reflect the increasing prevalence of adaptation and the extent to which many current risk, impacts and vulnerability estimates incorporate adaptation actions already taken. In addition, CCPs integrate across chapter topics, sectors and regions in particular types of geographies or ecosystems, termed typological regions, such as mountains, cities by the sea or tropical forests. CCPs are a new element in WGII AR6 included at the request of governments to highlight and expand relevant material from chapters and beyond into one place to ensure the integrated treatment of particular systems or regions and to improve accessibility of the report to readers.Finally, section three highlights sustainable development pathways integrating adaptation and mitigation through three synthesis chapters. The synthesis chapters summarise findings across all the chapters, CCPs and literatures on key risks, decision-making options and climate resilient development pathways that can lead from the current situation to a future more consistent with the stated policy goals. This report also assesses the adaptation options available, the extent to which such options can reduce risk, the effectiveness of current adaptation efforts, and their interactions with mitigation and sustainable development.
