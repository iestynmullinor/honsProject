Anthropogenic climate change is unequivocal and ongoing. The detection of specific changes in the climate and their diverse impacts on people and nature is advancing, with robust attribution of climate change to GHG emissions as well as to other contributing factors (e.g., socioeconomic development, land use change). In the AR6, advances include an increasing ability to link individual extreme weather and climate events to emissions of GHGs, increasing identification of impacts for societies and economies and strong linkages in the attribution methods across Working Groups (Cross-Working Group Box: ATTRIBUTION in Chapter 1).Impacts occurring today can be put into context through understanding of long-term changes on Earth, introduced in Cross-Chapter Box PALEO in Chapter 1. Climate has always varied and changed in the past, and this change often caused substantial ecological, evolutionary and socioeconomic impacts. Adaptation of ecosystems and societies occurred through responses as diverse as migration to mass extinction. Humankind is at the verge of leaving the Holocene climatic envelope, in which all human achievement since the advent of agriculture has occurred. In some systems, the changes and losses will be irreversible.
