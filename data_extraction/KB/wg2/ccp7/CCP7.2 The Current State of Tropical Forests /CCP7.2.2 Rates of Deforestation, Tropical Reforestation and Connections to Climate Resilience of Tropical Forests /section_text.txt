More than 420 million ha of forest were lost globally in the 1990–2020 period because of deforestation, and more than 90% of that loss took place in tropical areas (FAO, 2020). For the 2015–2020 period, the tropical deforestation rate decreased compared with 2010–2015, being estimated at 10.2 Mha yr −1 (FAO, 2020). But reforestation and afforestation rates have also decreased, resulting in a tropical forests net loss rate of 7.3 Mha yr −1 in the 2015–2020 period. Overall, the net loss rate has slightly decreased (−4%) since 1990 (high confidence). However, a particularly high upward trend is observed in Central America and the Caribbean, while a small increase (2%) is observed in the tropical zone of Africa, during the periods from 2010–2015 to 2015–2020 (Table CPP7.2).
