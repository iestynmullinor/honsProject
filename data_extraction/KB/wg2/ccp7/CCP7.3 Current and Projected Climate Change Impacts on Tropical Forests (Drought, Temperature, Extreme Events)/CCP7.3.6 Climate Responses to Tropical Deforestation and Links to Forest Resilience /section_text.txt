Since AR5, there has been meaningful advancement in understanding the climate effects of deforestation and concomitant changes in forest ecosystem resilience. The IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (Jia  et al., 2019) and IPCC AR6 WGI (Douville  et al., 2021) both describe significant climate-related changes resulting from tropical deforestation (high confidence).Deforestation generally reduces rainfall and enhances temperatures and landscape dryness; effects that increase with the scale of forest loss, whereas reforestation and afforestation generally reverses these effects (high confidence) (Lawrence and Vandecar, 2015; Alkama and Cescatti, 2016; Khanna  et al., 2017; Jia  et al., 2019; Staal  et al., 2020; Douville  et al., 2021; Hofmann  et al., 2021; Leite-Filho  et al., 2021). There is also medium evidence from observations and modelling that deforestation enhances surface runoff (Douville  et al., 2021). Whereas quantitative information is much more limited for other tropical regions, past deforestation in the Amazon has led to a small reduction in rainfall of −2.3% to −1.3%, shortening and delay of the wet season, and an estimated 4% increase in dryness (Leite-Filho  et al., 2020; Staal  et al., 2020; Douville  et al., 2021).Modelling studies estimate that large-scale tropical deforestation will contribute to average warming of the deforested areas with +0.61 ± 0.48°C and will lead to large changes in diurnal temperature ranges owing to a reduction of nocturnal cooling (medium confidence) (Jia  et al., 2019). Large-scale deforestation will also strongly decrease average regional precipitation and evapotranspiration and further delay the onset of the wet season, enhancing the chance of dry spells and intensifying dry seasons, but the magnitude of the decline depends on the scale and type of land-cover change (high confidence) (Zemp  et al., 2017; Jia  et al., 2019; Douville  et al., 2021; Gatti  et al., 2021).Continued forest landscape drying and fragmentation in connection with deforestation may also enhance surface flow variability (Farinosi  et al., 2019; Souza  et al., 2019) and will aggravate the risk of forest dieback (Zemp  et al., 2017), elevate forest flammability (Alencar  et al., 2015) and increase fire incidence (high confidence) (Aragão  et al., 2018; Jia  et al., 2019; Silveira  et al., 2020; dos Reis  et al., 2021), ultimately leading to savannisation of many tropical rainforests (Sales  et al., 2020). However, compositional heterogeneity and diversity of forest assemblages increases resilience against climate-enhanced forest degradation (Réjou-Méchain  et al., 2021).For the Amazon, deforestation (ca. 40% of the region) in combination with climate change will raise the prospect of passing a tipping point leading to large-scale savannisation of the rainforest biome, but uncertainty remains whether this will take place in the 21st century (Nobre  et al., 2016; Jia  et al., 2019; Douville  et al., 2021). However, considering that the Amazon has already lost ca. 20% of its forests (Nobre  et al., 2016), crossing the tipping point may not only create savannas of the deforested parts but may also result in precipitation reductions of 40% in non-deforested parts of the western Amazon due to a breakdown of the South American monsoonal circulation and the subsequent western cascade of precipitation and evapotranspiration (Boers  et al., 2017). Other effects of forest degradation include loss of ecosystem services, biodiversity, carbon storage and Indigenous culture (Watson  et al., 2018; Strassburg  et al., 2019; Gatti  et al., 2021), as well as potentially reduced hydropower capacity and agricultural production (Sumila  et al., 2017), and increases in tropical diseases (Husnina  et al., 2019).The dearth of data for tropical forest regions other than the Amazon makes assessments of deforestation-related changes in temperature, precipitation and streamflow difficult (high confidence), and hampers estimates of tropical forest ecosystem health, biodiversity loss and vulnerability to current and future climatic and other pressures (high confidence). There is, hence, a strong need for increased investment in relevant data and research to narrow the knowledge gaps (Davison  et al., 2021). Nonetheless, conclusions based on a newly developed tropical vulnerability index synthesising remotely sensed land use and climate information indicate that forests in the Americas are already reaching critical levels to multiple stressors, while forests in Asia reveal vulnerability primarily to land-use change and African forests still show relative resilience to climate change (Saatchi  et al., 2021).
