Forests will be affected by several climate change impacts that will require forest management towards fulfilling four objectives: maintain forest area; facilitate biodiversity adaptation; maintain healthy functioning forest ecosystems; and restore ecosystem services (including productive capacity) (Seppälä, 2009), which complement the more conventional approaches to protect, manage and restore forests (Sayer  et al., 2003). This is dependent on location-specific conditions that are defined by the type of forest and land tenure regimes or dominant actors across forest landscapes. The analysis here proposes 10 adaptation responses that focus on the adaptation potential of tropical forests to climate change and are linked to the management objectives identified (Figure CCP7.5). Each response option (1–10) implies variable economic costs and benefits, influenced by location-specific conditions, including several important non-monetised benefits. The figure suggests the most relevant situations in which the different response options hold greater potential to meet the forest management objectives for addressing expected climate change impacts.This assessment considers the economic costs and benefits of 10 response options in their contribution to adaptation of tropical forests to climate change impacts but also includes non-market costs that are more difficult to quantify (e.g., cultural values), which are borne by different stakeholders (Chan  et al., 2016; Pascual  et al., 2017). Similarly, benefits also include the social and environmental benefits that result from adaptation options over extended time horizons. Economic costs and benefit–cost ratios suggest the short-term economic potential of different options, but responsibly designed adaptation measures involving a combination of different response options and embracing a long-time horizon have the potential to provide significant social and climate benefits over the coming 50 years or more.
