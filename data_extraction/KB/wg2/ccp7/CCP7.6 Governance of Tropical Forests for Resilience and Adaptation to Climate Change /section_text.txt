There is increasing evidence of positive impacts of resilient tropical forests, biodiversity and sustainable forest management in achieving SDGs, as presented in Table Box CCP7.2.1. However, there is also risk of unintended consequences based on conflicts between the use of forest-based goods and services, and effects on tropical forest resilience, ecosystem services and biodiversity (Baumgartner, 2019). For instance, substitution of fossil fuels and non-renewable resources with bio-based products can lead to deforestation and the loss of biodiversity (Carrasco, 2017) (Cross-Working-Group Box BIOECONOMY in Chapter 5). Deforestation as a result of increased agricultural production and productivity could hamper efforts in addressing long-term food security, particularly for forest-dependent people (Newton  et al., 2016; Section CCP7.2.3). Synergies and trade-offs depend very much on local contexts and are therefore presented in exemplary form.IFAD (2016) estimated that there are 640 million people living below the poverty line in rural areas of 43 tropical countries. Poor communities rely on ecosystem services for their subsistence livelihoods, and often they have limited capacity to adapt to change, making them more vulnerable to climate change and other forms of changes (Bhatta, 2015). Managing forests sustainably benefits both urban and rural communities, including provision of food and fibre, and on watershed hydrology and agroforestry production, among others (Powell  et al., 2013; Dawson  et al., 2014; Clark and Nicholas, 2013, Mbow  et al., 2014) (Table Box CCP7.2.1).Table Box CCP7.2.1 | Examples from sustainable tropical forest management (STFM) in achieving SDGs.SDGsContribution of STFM to the goalsAdaptation interventionsSupporting references1 No povertyArea of forest land with legal property status held by communitiesIn Mexico, community forest management (CFM) has played a pivotal role in forest cover and biodiversity conservation in the region where timber production and processing generate income and thereby offers a way out of poverty for families in communities with rights to forests.(Ellis  et al., 2015)Improve incomes through selling forest products or by generating employment for the poorestNon-timber forest products (NTFPs) are a significant source for socioeconomic, employment and income generation, particularly for tribal people.(Kumar, 2015)Improve income through valuation of ecosystem servicesIn Cambodia, contribution of forest resources should be integrated into payment for ecosystem services schemes, to provide more diversified income streams, insulating Indigenous People from shocks and stressors.(Nhem, 2018)2 Zero hungerForests also provide food, which improves food security and nutritionIn Cameroon, forest fruits provide important macro- and micronutrients lacking from the family diets of rural people. Association between tree cover and the dietary diversity of children in the communities of 21 countries across Africa.(Fungo  et al., 2015; Ickowitz  et al., 2014)3 Good health and well-beingMedicinal plants contribute to emotional and spiritual well-beingMedicinal plants and the associated Bhutanese traditional medicine are protected by the country’s constitution and receive both government support and acceptance by the wider public. These medicinal plants have been one of the drivers of the ‘gross national happiness’ and biodiscovery projects in Bhutan.(Wangchuk and Tobgay, 2015)Health co-benefits of preserving biodiversityIn the Brazilian Amazon, interventions targeted specifically at preserving biodiversity in protected areas generate health co-benefits. From the perspectives of malaria, acute respiratory infection and diarrhoea, results suggest that the public health benefits of strict partnership agreements may offset some of their local costs. Nature is doing its part by providing a form of (human) capital for the rural poor and the politically voiceless.(Bauch  et al., 2015)4 Quality educationInclusive education that builds and reinforces positive attitudes to forestEncouraging and enabling pro-forest behaviour as well as strengthening education systems that respect, nurture and enable Indigenous Knowledge and Local Knowledge.(Kanowski, 2019; Tengö, 2017; Vaidyanathan, 2014)The value of social capital for maintaining sustainability of community forest management includes, among others, individual characteristics, procedural knowledge and access to information. Initiatives to manage natural resources are likely  to be more successful if the forest management program initiators consider several factors that influence the capacity development of resource users.(Lee, 2017)5 Gender equalityWithin genders, other characteristics such as class, race, caste, culture, wealth, age and ethnicity influence responses and affect the impact of climate variability and change on livelihoodsDespite challenges, Nepal’s community forestry policy is considered one of the most progressive, as it allows women to exercise equal rights with men in the management and utilisation of community forests. Furthermore, women-only forestry groups have registered many success stories.(Lama  et al., 2017; Agarwal, 2015)6 Clean water and sanitationRegulate water supply, water quality and water purificationEvidence from the Hindu Kush Himalayas require improved upstream–downstream integration, transboundary cooperation and greater coordination of implementation of different SDGs. Greater efforts are required to make the communities struggling on the frontline of sustainable forest management more climate resilient.(Scott C.A., 2019; Amezaga, 2019)Forest concessions can make a positive contribution to this by minimising the negative impacts of harvesting operations on water access and by employing appropriate restoration techniques as required by the concession contract and national legislation.(Bruggeman  et al., 2015)7 Affordable and clean energyEnergy transitionsDecreased reliance on traditional wood fuels and increased use of forest-derived modern fuels (e.g., biofuel) are generally synergistic with achieving other SDGs, such as livelihoods strategies. However, modern wood fuels need improved stoves to ensure the energy is clean.(Jagger, 2019; Simangunsong  et al., 2017)8 Decent work and economic growthStimulating economic growth and minimising forest lossSynergy potentials exist where growth strategies and associated policies target the forest section with NTFPs from natural forests, ecotourism and payments for environmental services.(Stoian, 2019)Community forestry enterprises have the potential to make significant contributions by providing a solid institutional framework to efficiently translate SDGs into actions. It also improves forest management, social cohesion and rural incomes among local communities in developing countries.(Aryal, 2020; Vázquez-Maguirre, 2020; Baynes, 2015)9 Industry innovation and infrastructureIntegration of small-scale business into value chains and marketsStrategies in relation to sustainable supply chains and tropical forest protection, i.e., Unilever and Instituto Centro de Vida (ICV), demonstrate both alignment and variability between and within organisations. Associated incentives could help balance the burden of responsibility for implementation between global and local actors of promoting zero deforestation.(Delabre  et al., 2020)10 Reduced inequalitiesReduction in the number of poor householdsProtect the workers and communities long-term and economic well-beingResults from Waseda–Bridgestone Initiative for Development of Global Environment (W-BRIDGE Initiative) in South Kalimantan province through capacity building delivered by academic partners. This initiative also increased land area ownership from 0.28 to 1.23 ha per household.Rural agrarian communities in low-latitude tropical forests (e.g., communities in Southeast Asia, South America, Central Africa) adapting to chronically hotter temperatures in common ways, such as adjusting when and how they work. Decision makers should develop an understanding of these behavioural adaptations that are already being adopted before establishing broader adaptation strategies.(Hiratsuka, 2019)(Masuda, 2019)11 Sustainable cities and communitiesUpstream forests influence water supplies to citiesWatershed condition is associated with measurable health outcomes downstream. Maintaining natural capitals within watersheds is an important public health investment especially for populations with low levels of built capital.(Herrera  et al., 2017)Evidence from the Marikina Watershed Integrated Resources Development Alliance in the Philippines working together with all stakeholders to restore Marikina Watershed to reduce disaster risk and urban resilience.(Devisscher, 2019)Synergies delivered through sound urban forestry approaches could benefit not only urban dwellers but also forest communities. Community groups have also taken responsibility for urban forestry in the absence of strong government commitment.(Konijnendijk, 2018)12 Responsible consumption and production)Generates materials for sustainable consumptionForest concessionaires can also increase the repurposing of waste to improve sustainable consumption. For instance, the logging company Congolaise Industrielle des Bois produces electricity from sawmill wood waste.(Tegegne  et al., 2019)13 Climate actionEnhance resilience and adaptive capacities to climate change through forest managementMixed agroforestry systems offer opportunities to simultaneously meet the water, food, energy and income needs of densely populated rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia.(van Noordwijk  et al., 2016)Carbon-based conservationPayment for carbon-based conservation (eg., REDD+, Green Climate Fund) protecting peatlands from avoidable human impacts for favourable return from carbon conservation investments.(Roucoux  et al., 2017)REDD+ has mixed impacts on communities’ socio-ecological resilience. On one hand, increases in network ties and participation in decision making would enhance potential for local adaptability. However, restrictions on local forest practices could limit communities’ ability to manage uncertainty.(Hajjar, 2021)14 Life below water)Support numerous ecosystem servicesProtection for aquatic macroinvertebrates habitatsComplex root systems serve as shelter as they protect juvenile fish from predators and provide food and nutrients for fish.Mangroves contribute to fisheries production and have become one of the higher carbon stocks compared with other forests. The mangroves system of the Zambezi River Delta, Mozambique confirms the consistency of substantial C stocks typical of mangroves across a relatively large and hydrologically diverse area.The riparian canopy of the tropical forest is significantly able to maintain in-stream temperature that is important to aquatic macroinvertebrates. The study of Gunung Tebu, Malaysia showed high diversity and abundance of steams invertebrates as the natural habitats are minimally impacted.(Friess, 2019)(Stringer, 2015)(Md rai, 2014)15 Life on land)Community monitoring of their own forests or forest within communal jurisdiction, sustainable certificationMainstreaming SFM in vast tracts of forest, thereby increasing the share of forest area under a forest management plan, including the proportion of forest area certified under independent forest certification schemes.(van Hensbergen, 2016)Even with tension between the management of resources for local goals and the need for public good values, still there are some communities that maintain strong control over their lands and resources in achieving desirable conservation outcomes and willing to see large tracts of land set aside, i.e., areas held to be sacred.(Sayer  et al., 2015; Sheil, 2015)16 Peace, justice and strong institutionsAddressing complexity of implementing conservation policyTarget 16.7 calls for responsive, inclusive participatory and representative decision making at all levels. Decentralisation in forest governance observed through community-based/collaborative forest management depends on the strength of underlying land tenure and use rights, as well as capacity to benefit from those rights.(Baynes, 2015; McDermott, 2019; Myers, 2017; Nunan, 2018)By 2021, Thailand plans to increase use of renewable and alternative energy by 25% including energy crops. Adequate forest protection is critical, as increasing demand for energy crops may drive demand for expanding agricultural production into public forests, benefitting some SDGs and threatening others.(Phumee, 2018)Modern technologies in forest management controlGovernance laws and policies provide access to justice for allTechnologies including remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) are interrelated as they support management actions in global forest resources management thus reducing exploitation through monitoring and evaluation activities.The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) significantly contribute to ensuring the legality of the timber supply chain. The (FAO, 2018b) considers the proportion of forest with secure tenure rights for forest dependent people and the local community in ensuring equal rights to economic resources for all.(Beckline, 2017)(Gabay, 2019)17 Partnership for the goalsCo-benefits derived from tropical forest conservationRaising awareness of the interconnectedness of tropical forests and the SDGs through multi-disciplinary collaboration will support more informed decisions of social, cultural, economic and policy interest.(Swamy, 2018; Bukoski  et al., 2018)Voluntary partnership agreements (VPAs) stabilise and reproduce the forest governance regimeCentral bureaucracies promote forest benefits: countering conservationIn Ghana, the adoption of the VPA resulted in an improved the timber legality assurance system (TLAS), strengthened social responsibility agreements (SRA) enforcement, updated forest management plans, artisanal milling strategies and technical transparent timber dights allocations.Forest management units (FMUs) could be utilised to support conservation-oriented regimes with worldwide interests as well as domestic production-oriented regimes. For example, FMUs might potentially link up with global and domestic timber certification regimes under the Multistakeholder Forestry Programme (MFP3) initiative.Box CCP7.2(Hansen, 2018)(Sahide, 2016)
