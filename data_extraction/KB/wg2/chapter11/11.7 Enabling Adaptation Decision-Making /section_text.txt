Implementing enablers can help drive adaptation ambition and action consistent with climate resilient development (very high confidence) (11.7.3, Table 11.17). However, the scale and scope of cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts (11.5.1) calls for new and timely adaptation, including more effective ongoing monitoring, evaluation, review and continual adjustment (11.7.3) towards the transformations that can break through the path dependencies that define the way things are done now (Cradock-Henry et al., 2018b; UN et al., 2018; Head, 2020). However, complex interactions between objectives can create social and economic trade-offs (Table 11.1, 11.3.5.3, 11.7.3.1, Box 11.6).Delay in implementing climate change adaptation and emissions reductions will impede climate resilient development, resulting in more costly climate impacts and greater scale of adjustments in the future (IPCC, 2018) (11.5.1, 11.5.2, Box 11.6) and legal risks for those with adaptation mandates and for financial institutions (11.5.1) (very high confidence). The scale and scope of societal change needed for the region to transition to more climate resilient development pathways requires close attention to governance, ethical questions, the role of civil society and the place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and Tangata Whenua Māori in the co-production of ongoing adaptation at multiple scales (Loorbach et al., 2017; Koehler et al., 2019; Hill et al., 2020). The region faces an extremely challenging future that will be highly disruptive for many human and natural systems (IPCC, 2018) (UNEP, 2020; AAS, 2021; IPCC, 2021) (11.5.1, 11.6, 11.7; Boxes 11.1–11.6; Table 11.14). The extent to which the limits to adaptation are reached depends on whether global warming peaks this century at 1.5°C, 2°C or 3+°C above pre-industrial levels. Whatever the outcome, adaptation and mitigation are essential and urgent (very high confidence).
