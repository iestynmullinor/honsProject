Adaptation decision support tools enable a shift from reactive to anticipatory planning for changing climate risks (high confidence). The available tools are diversifying with futures and systems methodologies and dynamic adaptive policy pathways being increasingly used (Bosomworth et al., 2017; Prober et al., 2017; Lawrence et al., 2018a; CoA, 2020e; Rogers et al., 2020a; Schneider et al., 2020) (11.5; Box 11.6) to facilitate the shift from static to dynamic adaptation by highlighting path dependencies and potential lock-in of decisions, system dependencies and the potential for cascading impacts (Table 11.17) (Wilson et al., 2013; Clarvis et al., 2015; Pearson et al., 2018; Cradock-Henry et al., 2020b; Lawrence et al., 2020b). Modelling and tools to test the robustness and cost-effectiveness of options (Infometrics and PSConsulting, 2015; Qin and Stewart, 2020) can be used alongside adaptation strategies with decision-relevant and usable information (Smith et al., 2016; Tangney, 2019; Serrao-Neumann et al., 2020), particularly when supported by effective governance and national and sub-national guidance (Box 11.6).More inclusive, collaborative and learning-oriented community engagement processes are fundamental to effective adaptation outcomes (11.7.3.2) (very high confidence) (Boston, 2016; Lawrence and Haasnoot, 2017; Sellberg et al., 2018; Serrao-Neumann et al., 2019a; Simon et al., 2020). More participatory vulnerability and risk assessments can better reflect different knowledge systems, values, perspectives, trade-offs, dilemmas, synergies, costs and risks (Jacobs et al., 2019; Ogier et al., 2020; Tonmoy et al., 2020). A shift from hierarchical to more cooperative governance modalities can assist effective adaptation (Vermeulen et al., 2018; Steffen et al., 2019; CoA, 2020e; Lawrence et al., 2020b; MfE, 2020a; Hanna et al., 2021).Regular monitoring, evaluation, communication and coordination of adaptation are essential for accelerating learning and adjusting to dynamic climate impacts and changes in socioeconomic and cultural conditions (high confidence) (Moloney and McClaren, 2018; Palutikof et al., 2019a; Cradock-Henry et al., 2020a). Training to improve decision makers’ ‘evaluative capacity’ can play a role (Scott and Moloney, 2021). Climate action benchmarking, diagnostic tools and networking can enhance the adaptation process across diverse decision settings (e.g., water, coasts, protected areas and Indigenous Peoples) (Ayre and Nettle, 2017; Davidson and Gleeson, 2018; Coenen et al., 2019; Gibbs, 2020). Effective adaptation requires cross-jurisdictional and cross-sectoral policy coherence and national coordination (Delany-Crowe et al., 2019; Rychetnik et al., 2019; MfE, 2020c).
