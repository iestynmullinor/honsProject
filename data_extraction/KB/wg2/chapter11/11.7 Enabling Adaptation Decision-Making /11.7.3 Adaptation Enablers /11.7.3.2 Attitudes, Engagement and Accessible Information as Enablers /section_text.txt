Concern for climate change has become widespread (Hopkins, 2015; Borchers Arriagada et al., 2020), giving climate adaptation social legitimacy (high confidence). Over three quarters of Australians (77%) agree that climate change is occurring, and 61% believe climate change is caused by humans (Merzian et al., 2019). A growing proportion of Australians perceive links between climate change and high temperatures experienced during heatwaves and extremely hot days (Summer 2018/2019) (48%), droughts and flooding (42%) and urban water shortages (30%) (Merzian et al., 2019). Rural populations in NSW perceive climate change impacts as stressing their well-being and mental health and requiring leadership and action (Austin et al., 2020). In New Zealand, between 2009 and 2018, the proportion of New Zealanders who agreed or strongly agreed that climate change is real increased from 58% to 78% (a 34.5% increase), while those agreeing or strongly agreeing that it was caused by humans increased from 41% to 64% (a 56.1% increase) (Milfont et al., 2021). Nevertheless, New Zealanders have a tendency to overestimate the amount of sea level rise (SLR), especially among those most concerned about climate change and incorrectly associate it with melting sea ice, which has implications for engagement and communication strategies (Priestley et al., 2021).The use of more systemic, collaborative and future-oriented engagement approaches is facilitating adaptation in local contexts (high confidence) (Rouse et al., 2013; MfE, 2017a; Leitch et al., 2019). Local ‘adaptation champions’ and experimental and tailored engagement processes can enhance learning (McFadgen and Huitema, 2017; Lindsay et al., 2019). Dynamic adaptive pathways planning (Lawrence et al., 2019a) and inclusive community governance (Schneider et al., 2020) can help progress difficult decisions such as the relocation of cultural assets and managed retreat, and contestation about which public goods to prioritise and how adaptation should be implemented (Kwakkel et al., 2016) (Colliar and Blackett, 2018). Participatory climate change scenario planning can test assumptions about the present and the future (Mitchell et al., 2017; Serrao-Neumann and Choy, 2018; Chambers et al., 2019; Serrao-Neumann et al., 2019c) and help envision people-centred, place-based adaptation (Barnett et al., 2014; Lindsay et al., 2019). Social network analysis can inform engagement and communication of adaptation (Cunningham et al., 2017). Knowledge brokers, information portals and alliances can help communities, governments and sector groups to better access and use climate change information (Shaw et al., 2013; Fünfgeld, 2015; Lawrence and Haasnoot, 2017). Novel approaches to building climate change literacy and adaptation capability go hand in hand with dedicated expert organisational support (Stevens and O’Connor, 2015; CCATWG, 2018; Palutikof et al., 2019c; Salmon, 2019). All of these approaches depend on adequate resourcing (very high confidence).
