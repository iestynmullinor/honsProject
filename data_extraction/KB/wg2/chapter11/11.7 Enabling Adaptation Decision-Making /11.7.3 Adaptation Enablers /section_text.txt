There are two priority areas where new knowledge is critical for accelerating adaptation implementation.System complexity and uncertainty in observed and projected impactsRegionally relevant projections of rainfall, runoff, compound and extreme weather (11.2.1, 11.3.3; Box 11.4)Inclusion of cascading and compounding impacts in integrated assessments (11.5.1), including for infrastructure (11.3.5), tourism (11.3.7) and health (11.3.6) and for different groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and Tangata Whenua MƒÅori communities (11.4)Impacts on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including in situ monitoring to detect ongoing changes especially in New Zealand (11.3.1), and marine biodiversity, including environmental tolerances of key life stages (11.3.2)Repository of indigenous species distribution data for monitoring responses to climate change and climate advisory services for New Zealand (11.3.1.3)National risk assessment for Australia (11.7.1)The interactions between adaptation and mitigation, particularly where land carbon mitigation is impacted by climate change (11.3.4.3; Box 11.5)Supporting adaptation decision makingBetter understanding of who and what is exposed and where and their vulnerability to climate hazards (11.3, 11.4)National assessments of the costs and benefits of climate change, with and without different levels and timings of adaptation and mitigation (11.5.2.3) (11.7.1)Understanding available adaptation strategies and options, their feasibility and effectiveness as the climate changes, including their intended and unintended outcomes (11.7, 11.8)Understanding how to embed robust planning approaches into decision making that retain flexibility to change course in the future (11.7.1).Mechanisms for sharing knowledge and practice of adaptation (11.7).The role of development paradigms, values and political economy in adaptation framing and effective implementation (11.8).Understanding social transitions and social licence, for timely, robust and transformational adaptation (11.8.2).
