In the near term (2030–2060), climate change is projected to become an increasingly dominant stress on the region’s biodiversity, with some ecosystems experiencing irreversible changes in composition and structure and some threatened species becoming extinct (high confidence). Climate change will interact with current ecological conditions, threats and pressures, with cascading ecological impacts, including population declines, heat-related mortalities, extinctions and disruptions for many species and ecosystems (high confidence) (Table 11.5). These include inadequate allocation of environmental flows for freshwater fish (Vertessy et al., 2019), native forest logging for old-growth-forest-dependent fauna (Lindenmayer et al., 2015; Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020a; Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020b), and invasive species (Scott et al., 2018). Climate change has synergistic and compounding impacts, particularly in bioregions already experiencing ecosystem degradation, threatened endemics and collapse of keystone species, including those of value to Indigenous Peoples, and high extinction rates as a consequence of human activities (Table 11.4) (Gordon, 2009; Australia SoE, 2016; Weeks et al., 2016; Cresswell and Murphy, 2017; Hare et al., 2019; MfE, 2019; Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020a; Lindenmayer and Taylor, 2020b; Bergstrom et al., 2021). Some native species are projected to have potentially greater geographic range if they can colonise new areas, while other species may be resilient to projected climate change impacts (Bulgarella et al., 2014; K.E. Lawrence et al., 2017; Conroy et al., 2019; Rizvanovic et al., 2019).Table 11.5 | An indicative selection of projected climate-change impacts on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and species in Australia and New Zealand respectively.Ecosystem, speciesClimate-related pressureProjected ImpactSourceAustraliaFloristic composition of vegetation communitiesIncreases in temperature and reductions in annual precipitation by 2070. Many plant species based on median projection from five global climate models (ACCESS1.0, CNRM-CM5, HADGEM2-CC, MIROC5, NorESM1-M) centred on the decade 2070 under RCP8.547% of vegetation types have characteristic plant species at risk of their climatic tolerances being exceeded from increasing mean annual temperature by 2070 with only 2% at risk from reductions in annual precipitation by 2070(Gallagher et al., 2019)Some south east Australian temperate forestsReduction in winter rainfall and rising spring temperatures resulting in an increase in the frequency of very high fire weather conditions and increased risk of catastrophic wildfires;

In Australia, most native eucalyptus forest plants have a range of traits that enable them to persist with recurrent fire through recovery buds (sprouters) or regenerate through seeding (Collins, 2020), affording them a high level of resilience. For high-end projected 2060–2080 fire weather conditions in southeast Australia (Clarke and Evans, 2019), stand-killing wildfires could occur at a severity and frequency greater than the regenerative capacity of seeders (Enright et al., 2015; Clarke and Evans, 2019). Most New Zealand native plants are not fire resistant and are projected to be replaced by fire-resistant introduced species following climate-change-related fires (Perry et al., 2014).A loss of alpine biodiversity in the southeast Australian Alps bioregion is projected in the near-term as a result of less snow on snow patch feldmark and short alpine herb fields as well as increased stress on snow-dependent plant and animal species (high confidence) (Table 11.3, Table 11.5). In Australia, invasive plants’ and weeds’ response rates are expected to be faster than for native species, and climate change could foster the appearance of a new set of weed species, with many bioregions facing increased impacts from non-native plants (medium confidence) (Gallagher et al., 2013; Scott et al., 2014; March-Salas and Pertierra, 2020) (Table 11.5), along with declines in some listed weeds (Duursma et al., 2013; Gallagher et al., 2013). In New Zealand, climate change is projected to enable invasive species to expand to higher elevations and southwards (medium confidence) (Table 11.5) (Giejsztowt et al., 2020; MfE, 2020a).Projected responses of ecosystem processes are uncertain in part due to complex interactions of climate change with soil respiration, plant nutrient availability (Hasegawa et al., 2015; Orwin et al., 2015; Ochoa-Hueso et al., 2017) and changing fire regimes (Table 11.5) (Scheiter et al., 2015; Dowdy et al., 2019). For aquatic biota, responses will reflect seasonal differences in water temperature (Wallace et al., 2015) and changes in rainfall intensity, productivity and biodiversity (Jardine et al., 2015). Extreme floods may have negative impacts on New Zealand river biota, by mobilising nutrients, sediments and toxic chemicals and aiding the dispersal of invasive species. These effects are compounded by homogenisation of rivers through channelisation (Death et al., 2015).Improved coastal modelling, experiments and in situ studies are reducing uncertainties at a local scale about the impact of future sea level rise (SLR) on coastal freshwater terrestrial wetlands (medium confidence) (Shoo et al., 2014; Bayliss et al., 2018; Grieger et al., 2019). Low-lying coastal wetlands are susceptible to saltwater intrusion from sea level rise (SLR) (Shoo et al., 2014; Kettles and Bell, 2015; Finlayson et al., 2017) with consequences for species dependent on freshwater habitats (Houston et al., 2020). Saline habitat conditions will move inland and new coastal ecosystem states may emerge, including the World Heritage listed Kakadu’s freshwater wetland (Bayliss et al., 2018) (Table 11.5). Increasingly, sea level rise (SLR) will shrink the intertidal zone, having implications for wading birds which use this zone (Tait and Pearce, 2019) (Box 11.6). The ecology of freshwater wetlands in New Zealand are projected to be impacted by the intersection of warming, drought and heavy rainfall (Pingram et al., 2021) (Table 11.5).The impacts on species from projected global warming depend on their physiological and ecological responses for which knowledge is limited (Table 11.5) (Bulgarella et al., 2014; Carter et al., 2018; Green et al., 2021). Knowledge of projected impacts is constrained by uncertainties about the influence of physiological limits, barriers to dispersal, competition, the availability of habitat resources (Worth et al., 2014) and disruptions to ecological interactions (Lakeman-Fraser and Ewers, 2013; Parida et al., 2015; Porfirio et al., 2016). Gaps in ecological modelling of future climate impacts include consideration of long-term rainfall and temperature changes (Grimm-Seyfarth et al., 2017; Grimm-Seyfarth et al., 2018), species dispersal rates, evolutionary capacity and phenotypic plasticity and the thresholds at which they are considered adequate to counter the impacts of climate change (Ofori et al., 2017b), as well as indirect effects including sea level rise (SLR) and altered fire regimes (Shoo et al., 2014; Cadenhead et al., 2016; He et al., 2016).
