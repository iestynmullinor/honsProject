In Australia, prolonged droughts and projections of a drier future have accelerated policy and management change in urban and rural water systems. Adaptation initiatives and mechanisms, like significant government investment to enhance the Bureau of Meteorology online water information (Vertessy, 2013; BoM, 2016), funding to improve agricultural water use and irrigation efficiency (Koech and Langat, 2018), enhanced supply through inter-basin transfers and upgrading water infrastructure and an active water trading market (Wheeler et al., 2013; Kirby et al., 2014; Grafton et al., 2016) are helping to buffer regional systems against droughts and facilitating some adaptation to climate change (medium confidence). However, these measures could also be maladaptive because they may perpetuate unsustainable water and land uses under ongoing climate change (Boxes 11.3 and 11.5).The widespread 2017–2019 drought across eastern Australia (BoM, 2021b) has led to the Australian government establishing a Future Drought Fund (Australian Government, 2019) to enhance drought resilience and a National Water Grid Authority to develop regional water infrastructure to support agriculture. Nevertheless, the ability to adapt to climate change is compounded by uncertainties in future water projections, complex interactions between science, policy, community values and political voice, and competition between different sectors dependent on water (Boxes 11.3 and 11.5). The impact of declining water resources on agricultural, ecosystems and communities in southeastern Australia would escalate with ongoing climate change (medium confidence) (Hart, 2016; Moyle et al., 2017), highlighting the importance of more ambitious, anticipatory, participatory and integrated adaptation responses (Bettini et al., 2015; Abel et al., 2016; Marshall and Lobry de Bruyn, 2021).Altered water regimes resulting from the combined effects of climatic conditions and water policies carry uneven and far-reaching implications for communities (high confidence). Acting on Indigenous Peoples’ claims to cultural flows (to maintain their connections with their country) is increasingly recognised as an important water management and social justice issue (Taylor et al., 2017; Hartwig et al., 2018; Jackson, 2018; Jackson and Moggridge, 2019; Moggridge et al., 2019). Compounding stressors, such as coal and coal seam gas developments, can also severely impact local communities, water catchments and water-dependent ecosystems and assets, exacerbating their vulnerability to climate change (Navi et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2015; Chiew et al., 2018).In Australian capital cities and regional centres, water planning has focused on securing new supplies that are resilient to climate change. This includes increasing use of stormwater and sewage recycling and managed aquifer recharge (Bekele et al., 2018; Page et al., 2018; Gonzalez et al., 2020). All major coastal Australian cities have desalination plants. Household scale adaptation, like rainwater harvesting, water-smart gardens, dual flush toilets, water-efficient showerheads and voluntary residential use targets, can help reduce water demand by up to 40% (Shearer, 2011; Rhodes et al., 2012; Moglia et al., 2018). Water utilities across Australia have established climate change adaptation guidelines (WSAA, 2016). Coordinated efforts to reduce demand, design and retrofit infrastructure to reduce flood risk and harvest water and to practice water-sensitive urban design are evident (WSAA, 2016; Kunapo et al., 2018; Rogers et al., 2020b). Transitioning centralised water systems to a more sustainable basis represents adaptation progress but is complex and faces many barriers and limits (medium confidence) (Morgan et al., 2020). Developing multiple redundant or decentralised systems can enhance community resilience and promote autonomous adaptations that may be more sustainable and cost effective in the longer term (Mankad and Tapsuwan, 2011; WSAA, 2016; Iwanaga et al., 2020).In New Zealand, many water supplies are at risk from drought, extreme rainfall events and sea level rise (SLR), exacerbated by underinvestment in existing water infrastructure (in part due to funding constraints) and urban densification (high confidence) (CCATWG, 2017; MfE and Stats NZ, 2021 ). Lessons can be learned from global experience (e.g., Cape Town, South Africa; Section 4.3.4). Water quality has diminished, with hotter conditions and drought causing algal blooms, combined with intensification of agricultural land uses in some areas, and heavy rainfall and sea level rise (SLR) causing flooding and sedimentation of water sources and health impacts (11.3.6; Box 11.5). Some towns are only partially metered or not metered at all, which exacerbates the adaptation challenge (Hendy et al., 2018; WaterNz, 2018; Paulik 2019a). Unregulated or absent water supplies accentuate risks to vulnerable groups of people (MfE, 2020b). Māori view water as the essence of all life, which makes any impacts on water a governance and stewardship concern, and increasingly, the subject of legal claims (MfE, 2020a; MfE, 2020b; MfE, 2020c) (11.4.2). Māori understanding of time can also open up new spaces for rethinking freshwater management in a climate change context that does not reinforce or rearticulate multiple environmental injustices (Parsons et al., 2021).Water resource adaptation in New Zealand is variable across local government and water authorities but they all actively monitor water availability, demand and quality, and most have drought management plans. The 2019/2020 drought led to water shortages in the most populated areas of Waikato, Auckland and Northland, resulting in water reduction advisories and 5 to 8 weeks’ waiting time for water tank refills and water rationing. The Havelock North water supply contamination, which arose after an extreme rainfall event (DIA, 2017a; DIA, 2017b), was exacerbated by fragmented governance and led to passage of the Taumata Arawai-Water Services Regulator Act of 2020 and the Water Services Bill of 2020 aimed at the protection of source water. The 2017 update to the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management contains guidelines for implementation at the regional level (MfE, 2017b), including consideration of climate change, which creates opportunities for adaptation. However, there remain tensions between land, water and people which are exacerbated by climate changes and have yet to be addressed (Box 11.5). The first National Adaptation Plan and the Resource Management law reform have the potential to help resolve these tensions (11.7.1) (CCATWG, 2017; MfE, 2020a).Table 11.7 | Cities, settlements and infrastructure: key risks and adaptation options.SectorKey RisksAdaptation OptionsInter-Sector DependenciesSourcesRoadHeat, SLR, coastal surges, floods and high-intensity rainfall impacts on road foundationsRe-routing, coastal protection, improved drainagePorts (fuel supply), rail (fuel supply), electricity(NCCARF, 2013; CoA, 2018a; MfE, 2020a)RailExtreme temperatures, flooding, SLR, high-intensity rainfall impacts on track foundationsDrainage and ventilation improvements, systematic risk assessments, overhead wire and rail/sleeper upgrades, re-routingElectricity, telecommunications, fuel supply (transport, ports)(CoA, 2018a; MfE, 2020a)Urban and Rural Built Environment 1Extreme temperatures, floods, extreme weather events, wildfire (at urban–rural interface), SLRMultiple options from the building-to-city scale to reduce heat impacts and improve climate resilience, behavioural change, coastal defences and managed retreatRoad, rail, electricity, air and seaports, telecommunications, water and wastewater(CoA, 2018a; Newton et al., 2018; Haddad et al., 2019; MfE, 2020a; Paulik et al., 2020; Tapper, 2021)(Box 11.1)(Box 11.4)ElectricityHigh-wind/ temperature events, wildfire, lightning, dust storms, drought (hydro)Demand management, re-engineering and new technology, network intelligence, smart metering, improved planning for outagesRoad, rail, water(CoA, 2017; MfE, 2020a)(11.3.10.)Ports: Air and SeaSLR, coastal surges, wind, heat, extreme weather eventsAir: improved coastal, pluvial and fluvial flood protection, on-site services; sea: widening operational limits, raising wharfs, roads and breakwatersElectricity, road, rail, water(McEvoy and Mullett, 2014; MfE, 2020a)TelecommunicationsFloods, wildfires, extreme windProtect, place underground, wireless systemsElectricity, digital connectivity, all sectors serviced, rural communities(NCCARF, 2013)Stormwater Wastewater and Water supply a.
