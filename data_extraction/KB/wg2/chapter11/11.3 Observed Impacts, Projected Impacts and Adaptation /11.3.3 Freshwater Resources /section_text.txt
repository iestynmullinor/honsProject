Pluvial (flash flood from high intensity rainfall) and fluvial (river) flooding are the most costly natural disasters in Australia, averaging AUD$8.8 billion per year  (Deloitte, 2017b). In New Zealand, insured damages for the 12 costliest flood events from 2007 to 2017 exceeded NZD$472 million, of which NZD$140 million has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change (Frame et al., 2020). Extreme rainfall intensity in northern Australia and New Zealand has been increasing, particularly for shorter (sub-daily) duration and more extreme high rainfall (high confidence) (Westra and Sisson, 2011; Griffiths, 2013; Laz et al., 2014; Rosier et al., 2015) (Table 11.2b). Changes are also occurring in spatial and temporal patterns and seasonality (Wasko and Sharma, 2015; Zheng et al., 2015; Wasko et al., 2016).Extreme rainfall is projected to become more intense (high confidence), but the magnitude of change is uncertain (Evans and McCabe, 2013; Bao et al., 2017) (Table 11.3). The insured damage in New Zealand from more intense extreme rainfall under RCP8.5 is projected to increase 25% by 2080–2100 (Pastor-Paz et al., 2020). In urban areas, extreme rainfall intensity is projected to increase pluvial flood risk (high confidence). In New Zealand, 20,000 km 2 of land, 675,000 people, and 411,000 buildings with a NZD$135 billion replacement value are exposed to flood risk (Paulik et al., 2019a).In non-urban areas, where the flood response is also dependent on antecedent catchment conditions (Johnson et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2018), there is no evidence of increasing flood magnitudes in Australia (Ishak et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016; Bennett et al., 2018), except for the most extreme events (Sharma et al., 2018; Wasko and Nathan, 2019). Modelling studies project increases in flood magnitudes in northern and eastern Australia and in western and northern New Zealand (high confidence) (Hirabayashi et al., 2013; Collins et al., 2018a; Do et al., 2020). The change in flood magnitude in southern Australia is uncertain because of the compensating effect of more intense extreme rainfall versus projected drier antecedent conditions (Johnson et al., 2016; Pedruco et al., 2018; Wasko and Nathan, 2019). Higher rainfall intensity and peak flows also increase erosion and sediment and nutrient loads in waterways (Lough et al., 2015) and exacerbate problems from ageing stormwater and wastewater infrastructure (Jollands et al., 2007; WSAA, 2016; Hughes et al., 2021).There is some recognition of the need for flood management and planning to adapt to climate change (medium confidence) (COAG, 2011; CCATWG, 2018; CoA, 2020d). Australian flood estimation guidelines recommend a 5% increase in design rainfall intensity per degree global average warming (Bates et al., 2015). In New Zealand, the recommended increase ranges from 5% to more than 10% for shorter-duration and longer-return-period storms (MfE, 2010; Carey-Smith et al., 2018). Both guidelines also indicate the potential for higher increases in extreme rainfall intensity.Adaptation to reduce flooding and its impacts have included improved flood forecasting (Vertessy, 2013; BoM, 2016) and risk management (AIDR, 2017), accommodating risk through raising floor levels and sealing external doors (Queensland Government, 2011; Wang et al., 2015), deploying temporary levee structures and reducing risk through spatial planning and relocation. Adaptation options in urban areas include improved stormwater management (Hettiarachchi et al., 2019; Matteo et al., 2019), ecosystem-based approaches such as maintaining floodplains, restoring wetlands and retrofitting existing flood control systems to attenuate flows, and water-sensitive urban design (WSAA, 2016; Radcliffe et al., 2017; Radhakrishnan et al., 2017; Rogers et al., 2020b).Adaptation to changing flood risks is currently mostly reactive and incremental in response to flood and heavy rainfall events (high confidence). For example, the 2010–2011 flooding in eastern Australia resulted in changes to reservoir operations to mitigate floods (QFCI, 2012) and insurance practice to cover flood damages (Phelan, 2011; Phelan et al., 2011; QFCI, 2012; Schuster, 2013). Nevertheless, adaptation planning that is pre-emptive and incorporates uncertainties into flood projections is emerging (medium confidence) (Schumacher, 2020). Examples from New Zealand include the use of Dynamic Adaptive Pathways Planning (DAPP) (Lawrence and Haasnoot, 2017) with Real Options assessment (Infometrics and PSConsulting, 2015) and designing decision signals and triggers to monitor changes before physical and coping thresholds are reached (Stephens et al., 2018). Implementing adaptive flood risk management relies upon an understanding of how such risks change in uncertain and ambiguous ways necessitating adaptive and robust decision-making processes. These can enable learning through participatory adaptive pathways approaches (Lawrence and Haasnoot, 2017; Bosomworth and Gaillard, 2019) and through coordination across different levels of government and statutory mandates, adaptation funding and individual and community adaptations (Glavovic et al., 2010; Boston and Lawrence, 2018; McNicol, 2021).Box 11.4
