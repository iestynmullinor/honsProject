Current snow-making technologies are expected to sustain the ski industry until mid-century. However, with warmer winter temperatures and declining water availability, snow-making is projected to decrease to half at most resorts by 2030 (Harris et al., 2016). New Zealand’s ski industry may benefit from Australian skiers visiting New Zealand due to lower relative vulnerability (Hopkins, 2015). However, tourists may substitute destinations or ski less in the absence of snow (medium agreement, limited evidence) (Cocolas et al., 2015; Walters and Ruhanen, 2015).With the exception of the ski industry (Becken, 2013; Hopkins, 2015), tourism stakeholders generally focus on coping with short-term weather events, rather than longer-term climate risks, but they do exhibit high adaptive capacity by diversifying their activities (Stewart et al., 2016). Post-COVID-19 pandemic economics and recovery policies challenge this sector’s prospects, and the combination of COVID-19 and climate change (e.g., fires, floods) has also highlighted the need for the tourism sector to be able to respond to multiple, overlapping crises.There is limited evidence that research into the impact of climate change on tourism in Australia and New Zealand is translating into policy or action (Moyle et al., 2017). New Zealand government tourism sector strategies acknowledge this and the need for greater understanding of climate change for the sector (TIA, 2019) but do not offer solutions (MBIE, 2019b; MfE, 2020a). The COVID-19 pandemic and the global pause of international travel offer an opportunity to potentially ‘reset’ tourism to account for the impacts of climate change (Prideaux et al., 2020).
