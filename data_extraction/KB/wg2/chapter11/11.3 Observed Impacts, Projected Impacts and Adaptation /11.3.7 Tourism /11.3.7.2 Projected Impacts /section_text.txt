Widespread impacts from projected climate change are very likely  across the tourism sector. The World Heritage listed Kakadu National Park in Australia is projected to experience increasing severity of cyclones (Turton, 2014), and sea level rise (SLR) is projected to affect freshwater wetlands (11.3.1.2; Table 11.5) (McInnes et al., 2015) and Indigenous rock art (Higham et al., 2016; Hughes et al., 2018a). The projected increase in the number of hot days in northern and inland Australia may impact the attractiveness of the region for tourists (Amelung and Nicholls, 2014; Webb and Hennessy, 2015). Coastal erosion and flooding of Australasian beaches due to sea level rise (SLR) and intensifying storm activity are estimated to increase by 60% on the Sunshine Coast by 2030, causing significant damage to tourist-related infrastructure (Hughes et al., 2018a). Urgent ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ adaptation strategies are projected to help reduce sea level rise (SLR) impacts (Becken and Wilson, 2016).Glacier tourism, a multi-million-dollar industry in New Zealand, is potentially under threat because glacier volumes are projected to decrease (very high confidence) (Purdie, 2013). Glacier volume reductions of 50–92% by 2099 relative to the present reflect the large range of temperature projections between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Under RCP2.6 at 2099, the glaciers retain a similar configuration to present, although clean-ice glaciers will retreat significantly. For RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, the clean-ice glaciers will retreat to become small remnants in the high mountains (Anderson et al. 2021).Snow skiing faces significant challenges from climate change (high confidence). In Australia, the annual maximum snow depth is estimated to decrease from current levels by 15% (2030) and 60% by 2070 (SRES A2) (Di Luca et al., 2018). By 2070–2099, relative to 2000–2010, the length of the Victorian ski season is projected to contract by 65–90% under RCP8.5 (Harris et al., 2016). The New Zealand tourism destination of Queenstown is expected to experience declining snowfall, increased wind and more severe weather events (Becken and Wilson, 2016). Ski tourism stakeholders have been responding to longer-term climate risks with an increase in snow-making machines in New Zealand since 2013 (Hopkins, 2015) and in Australia (Harris et al., 2016).
