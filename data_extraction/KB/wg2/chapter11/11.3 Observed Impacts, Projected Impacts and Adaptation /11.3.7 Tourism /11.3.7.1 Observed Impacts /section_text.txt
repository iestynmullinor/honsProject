Tourism is a major economic driver in the region, accounting for 3% (Australia) and 6% (New Zealand) of GDP pre-COVID-19 (WTTC, 2018). Climate change is having significant impacts on tourism due to the heavy reliance of the sector on natural heritage and outdoor attractions (11.3.1; Box 11.2). Furthermore, because Australia and New Zealand are both long-haul destinations, a global increase in ‘flygskam’ (flight shame) will likely impact travel patterns (Becken et al., 2021).Impacts of climate change are being observed across the tourism system (high confidence) (Scott et al., 2019a), most notably the GBR (Box 11.2) (Ma and Kirilenko, 2019). Australia’s ski industry is very sensitive to climatic change, due to reductions in snow depth and snow season length (Table 11.2) (Steiger et al., 2019; Knowles and Scott, 2020). The 2019–2020 summer wildfires (Box 11.1) impacted tourism and travel infrastructure, affecting air quality, vineyards and wineries (CoA, 2020e; Filkov et al., 2020). Global media coverage of the wildfires, alongside Australia’s climate change policy response, profoundly and negatively, affected Australia’s destination image (Schweinsberg et al., 2020; Wen et al., 2020). In New Zealand’s South Island, Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers have retreated approximately 700 m since 2008, with ice melt and retreat resulting in increased rock fall risks and negatively affecting the tourist experience (Purdie, 2013; Stewart et al., 2016; Wang and Zhou, 2019). The west coast of New Zealand is extremely prone to flooding events, impacting amenity values and access (Paulik et al., 2019a). Damage to tracks, huts and bridges have closed popular destinations, including the Hooker Glacier and the popular Routeburn and Heaphy Tracks during heavy rainfall events (Christie et al., 2020). Climate-driven damage is motivating ‘last chance’ tourism to see key natural heritage and outdoor attractions, for example, GBR (Piggott-McKellar and McNamara, 2016) and Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers (Stewart et al., 2016).
