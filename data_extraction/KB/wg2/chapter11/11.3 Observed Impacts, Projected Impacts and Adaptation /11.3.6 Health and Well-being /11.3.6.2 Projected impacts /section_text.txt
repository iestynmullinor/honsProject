Climate change is projected to have detrimental effects on human health due to heat stress, changing rainfall patterns including floods and drought climate-sensitive air pollution (including that caused by wildfires) (high confidence) and vector-borne diseases  (medium confidence). Vulnerability to detrimental effects of climate change will vary with socioeconomic conditions (high confidence).The greatest number of people affected by compounding effects of heat, wildfires and poor air quality will be in urban and peri-urban areas of Australia. By 2100 the proportion of all deaths attributable to heat in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane may rise from about 0.5% to 0.8% (under RCP 2.6), or 3.2% (under RCP 8.5) (Gasparrini et al., 2017). Heatwave related excess deaths in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane are projected to increase to 300/year (RCP2.6) or 600/year (RCP8.5) during 2031–2080 relative to 142/year during 1971–2020, assuming no adaptation and high population growth (Guo et al., 2018). High temperatures amplify the risks due to local air pollution: without adaptation, ozone-related deaths in Sydney may increase by 50–60/year by 2070 (Physick et al., 2014).Unless there is more effective control of nutrient runoff, bacterial contamination of drinking water supplies is projected to increase due to more intense rainfall events, exacerbating risks to human health (Gilpin et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020), and higher temperatures will increase freshwater toxic blooms (Hamilton et al., 2016).In general, the area of Australia suitable for the transmission of dengue  is projected to increase (Zhang and Beggs, 2018; Messina et al., 2019), but estimates of local disease risk vary considerably according to climate change scenario and socioeconomic pathways (Williams et al., 2016). The spread of Wolbachia among Aedes mosquitoes in northern Australia has already reduced dengue transmission and may decrease the influence of climate in the future (Ryan et al., 2019). In New Zealand, the risk of dengue remains low for the remainder of this century (Messina et al., 2019). Higher temperatures and more intense rainfall may also increase pollen production and the risk of allergic illness throughout the region (Haberle et al., 2014).
