Many mines are exposed and sensitive to climate extremes (high confidence), but there is little available research on climate change impacts on them (Odell et al., 2018). Most Australian mines face higher temperatures, cyclones, erosion and landslides and hazards such as sea level rise (SLR) and storms across their supply chains, including ports (Cahoon et al., 2016). Impacts include operational disruptions such as acute drainage problems (Loechel and Hodgkinson, 2014) and heat-induced illness, irritation and absenteeism among workers (McTernan et al., 2016), lost revenue and increased costs (Pizarro et al., 2017).Damage and disruption from climate impacts can cost operators billions of dollars (Cahoon et al., 2016). Climatic extremes increase the risk and impact of spillages along transportation routes (Grech et al., 2016), exacerbate miningâ€™s effects on hydrology, ecosystems and air quality (Phillips, 2016; Ali et al., 2018), increase contamination risks (Metcalfe and Bui, 2016) and disrupt and slow mine site rehabilitation (Wardell-Johnson et al., 2015; Hancock et al., 2017). Adaptations such as improved water management are emerging slowly (Gasbarro et al., 2016; Becker et al., 2018). Some companies are spatially diversifying and relocating (Hodgkinson et al., 2014). Others are replacing workers with automation and remote operations (Halteh et al., 2018; Keenan et al., 2019).
