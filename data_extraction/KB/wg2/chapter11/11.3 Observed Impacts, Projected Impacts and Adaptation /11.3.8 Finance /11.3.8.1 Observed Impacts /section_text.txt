The finance sector has significant exposure to climate variability and extreme events (high confidence).Aggregated insured losses from weather-related hazard events from 2013 to 2020 were almost AUD$15 billion for Australia (1.2% of GDP) and almost NZD$1 billion for New Zealand (0.4% of GDP) (NIWA, 2020; ICA, 2021) (ICA, 2020a; NIWA, 2020). However, there is no trend in normalised losses because the rising insurance costs are being driven by more people living in vulnerable locations with more to lose (McAneney et al., 2019). In New Zealand, two major hailstorms during 2014–2020 and three major floods during 2019–2021 caused significant insurance losses (ICNZ, 2021). Insured losses exceeded NZD$472 million for the 12 costliest floods from 2007 to 2017, of which NZD$140 million could be attributed to anthropogenic climate change (Frame et al., 2020). In Australia, insured damage was almost AUD$1.0 billion for the Queensland hailstorm in 2020, AUD$1.7 billion for east coast flooding in 2020, AUD$2.3 billion for the 2019–2020 fires, AUD$2.3 billion for the Queensland hailstorm in 2019, AUD$1.2 billion for the North Queensland floods in 2019, AUD$1.4 billion for the NSW hailstorm in 2018, AUD$1.8 billion for Cyclone Debbie in 2017 and AUD$1.5 billion for the Brisbane hailstorm in 2014 (ICA, 2020b). The insured loss from the seven costliest hailstorms in Australia from 2014 to 2021 totalled AUD$7.6 billion (ICA, 2021).Some homes in the highest-risk areas tend to be in lower socioeconomic groups that may not buy insurance (Actuaries Institute, 2020). For example, a quarter of residents that experienced loss or damage in the 2019 Townsville floods did not have insurance (ACCC, 2020). Underinsurance reduces people’s capacity to recover from adverse events, while over-reliance on private insurance undermines collective disaster recovery efforts (Lucas and Booth, 2020). In Australia, those in high-risk areas minimise house and contents insurance for financial reasons (Booth and Harwood, 2016; Osbaldison et al., 2019; Actuaries Institute, 2020). Insurance premiums in northern Australia are almost double those in the rest of Australia, and rising, mainly due to cyclone damage (ACCC, 2020).
