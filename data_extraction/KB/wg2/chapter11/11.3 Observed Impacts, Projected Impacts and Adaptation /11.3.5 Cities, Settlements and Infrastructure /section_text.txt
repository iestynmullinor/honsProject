In cities and settlements, climate adaptation is under way and is being led and facilitated by state and local government leadership and facilitation, particularly in Australia (high confidence) (Hintz et al., 2018; Newton et al., 2018) (Table 11.7, Supplementary Material Table SM11.1a).Effective adaptations to urban heat include spatial planning, expanding tree canopy and greenery, shading, sprays and heat-resistant and energy-efficient building design, including cool materials and reflective or green roofs (very high confidence) (Broadbent et al., 2018; Jacobs et al., 2018b; Haddad et al., 2019; Haddad et al., 2020a; Yenneti et al., 2020; Bartesaghi-Koc et al., 2021; Tapper, 2021). Reducing urban heat not only benefits human health but reduces the demand for, and cost of, air conditioning (Haddad et al., 2020b) and the risk of electricity blackouts (11.3.10).Adaptation progress is being hampered by current urban redevelopment practice and statutory planning guidelines that are leading to the removal of critical urban green space (Newton and Rogers, 2020). Reform of approaches to urban redevelopment would facilitate adaptation (Newton and Rogers, 2020). Several cities in Australia and New Zealand are part of the 100 Resilient Cities global network, which helped facilitate the metropolitan Melbourne Urban Forest Strategy across councils (Fastenrath et al., 2019; Coenen et al., 2020), and in New Zealand, restoration of the urban forest in Hamilton is reducing heat stressors (Wallace and Clarkson, 2019). In peri-urban zones, adapting to fire risk is a contested issue, raising difficult trade-offs between heat management, ecological values and fuel reduction in treed landscapes (Robinson et al., 2018).The resilience of Australia’s major cities to flooding and drought has been advanced through a range of economic and physical interventions. Water-sensitive urban design irrigates vegetation with harvested storm water that improves water security, flood risk, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and air and water quality and delivers cooling that can save human lives in heatwaves (Wong et al., 2020). Stormwater harvesting is supported by some councils in New Zealand and can deliver recycled water for households (Attwater and Derry, 2017), improving climate resilience and reducing water demand (White et al., 2017). Addressing infrastructure vulnerability is essential given the long lifetime of assets, criticality of services and high costs of maintenance  (Chester et al., 2020; Hughes et al., 2021).Climate risk management is evolving, but adaptive capacity, implementation, monitoring and evaluation are uneven across all scales of cities, settlements and infrastructure (very high confidence)   (Table 11.15a and Table 11.15b; Supplementary Material Tables SM11.1a and SM11.1b)  . There is increasing awareness of the need to move from incremental coping and defensive coastal strategies (Jongejan et al., 2016) to transformational adaptation, for example managed retreat (Torabi et al., 2018; Hanna, 2019), and to consider the flow-on effects (e.g., for housing and employment) (Fatorić et al., 2017; Torabi et al., 2018). Strategies limited to building household and community self-reliance (Astill and Miller, 2018) are increasingly inadequate given systemic and interconnected stressors and cascading impacts across interdependent systems (Lawrence et al., 2020b). Integrated approaches to climate change adaptation and emissions reduction have potential for addressing interdependent systems (e.g., nature-based approaches, climate-sensitive urban design, energy and transport systems) (Norman et al., 2021). Climate risk assessment and adaptation guidelines have been prepared for transport infrastructure authorities and organisations (Finlayson et al., 2017; Byett et al., 2019; Yenneti et al., 2020). Infrastructure service vulnerability in New Zealand is supported by new institutional adaptations including the Infrastructure Commission to develop a 30-year national infrastructure strategy. The Climate Change Commission (Climate Change Commission, 2020) has issued six principles for climate-relevant infrastructure investments and is mandated to monitor the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan based on the first National Climate Change Risk Assessment (MfE, 2020a). A National Disaster Resilience Strategy addresses integrated planning for risk reduction and awareness-raising in New Zealand (Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, 2019).Successive inquiries and reviews highlight potential synergies between disaster risk management and climate resilience (11.5.1) (Smith and Lawrence, 2018; Ruane, 2020). In Australia, there is a National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework (CoA, 2018b) and a National Recovery and Resilience Agency (CoA, 2021) that help underpin the development of national support systems for rural and regional emergency management and associated volunteer sectors (McLennan et al., 2016) and wildfire smoke impacts (CoA, 2020e). The National Heatwave Framework Working Group uses a Heatwave Forecast Service, and heatwave early-warning and adaptation systems that operate in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane have reduced potential death rates (Nitschke et al., 2016).Infrastructure planning is lagging behind international standards for climate resilience evaluation and guidance for adaptation to climate risk (high confidence) (CSIRO, 2020; Kool et al., 2020; Hughes et al., 2021). Some companies have examined their exposure to climate risk and developed strategies to minimise their vulnerability (Climate Institute, 2012) (11.3.8). Climate risk assessments have been conducted for the electricity sector in both Australia and New Zealand (11.3.10). Climate change is considered in Australian infrastructure plans for national and regional water supply security, water for irrigated agriculture, a coastal hazards adaptation strategy and the Tanami Road upgrade (Infrastructure Australia, 2016; Infrastructure Australia, 2019; Infrastructure Australia, 2021)Industry associations are beginning to facilitate climate adaptation for infrastructure, including the Australian Green Infrastructure Council (CoA, 2015), the Green Building Council of Australia Green Star Programme (GBCA, 2020), the Water Services Association of Australia, Climate Change Adaptation Guidelines (WSAA, 2016) and the Australian Sustainable Built Environment Council Built Environment Adaptation Framework (ASBEC, 2012). The Infrastructure Sustainability Rating Scheme measures the social, environmental, governance and cultural outcomes delivered by more than AUD$160 billion worth of infrastructure, and it is projected to deliver a cost-benefit ratio of 1:1.6 to 1:2.4 during the period 2020–2040 (RPS, 2020). There is scope for engagement of industry in transitioning to a low-carbon green economy that is adapted to climate change, but less certainty on how to develop appropriate business cases (Newton and Newman, 2015).There are tensions between settlement-scale adaptation options, such as managed retreat, that focus on the long term and people’s values, place attachments, needs and capacities (Gorddard et al., 2016; Fatorić et al., 2017; Graham et al., 2018; O’Donnell, 2019; Norman et al., 2021). Tensions also exist between climate change adaptation and mitigation goals (e.g., current energy efficiency standards in Australian buildings can worsen their heat resistance and increase dependence on air-conditioning) (Hatvani-Kovacs et al., 2018). Where there is a lack of coordination between jurisdictions, there can be flow-on effects from failure to adapt, for example in coastal local government areas (Dedekorkut-Howes et al., 2020) (Box 11.6). There is limited information across the region on climate change impacts and adaptation options for telecommunications (NCCARF, 2013) (Table 11.7). There is an emerging recognition that implementing and evaluating the adaptation process (vulnerability and risk assessments, identification of options, planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation and review) in local contexts can advance more effective adaptation (Moloney and McClaren, 2018). For example, the Victorian state government has built monitoring, evaluation and adaptation components into its adaptation plan (Table 11.15a).
