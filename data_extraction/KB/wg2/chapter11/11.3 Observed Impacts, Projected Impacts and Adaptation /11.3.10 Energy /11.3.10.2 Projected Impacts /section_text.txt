Risks for the energy sector are projected to increase with climate change (medium confidence). Projected increases in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves, fires, droughts and wind-storms would increase risks for energy supply and demand (AEMO, 2020b; ESCI, 2021). Households are unevenly vulnerable to energy sector risks due to varying housing quality and health dependencies (11.3.6). In New Zealand, a warmer climate and increasing energy efficiency is projected to marginally reduce annual average peak electricity heating demand (Stroombergen et al., 2006; MBIE, 2019a). Winter and spring inflows to main hydro lakes are projected to increase 5–10% and may reduce hydroelectric energy vulnerability (McKerchar and Mullan, 2004; Poyck et al., 2011; Stevenson et al., 2018). However, major electricity supply disruptions are projected to increase as dependence on electricity grows from 25% of total energy in 2016 to 58% in 2050 (Transpower, 2020).In Australia, the total heating and cooling energy demand of 5-star energy-rated houses is projected to change by 2100 (Wang et al., 2010). At 2°C global warming, the estimated change in demand is −27% in Hobart, −21% in Melbourne, +61% in Darwin, +67% in Alice Springs and +112% in Sydney. For a 4°C global warming, the changes are −48%, −14%, +135%, +213% and +350% respectively.
