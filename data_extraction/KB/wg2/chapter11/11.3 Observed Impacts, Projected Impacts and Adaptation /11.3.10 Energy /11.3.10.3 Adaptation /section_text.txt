Options to manage risks include adaptation of energy markets, integrated planning, improved asset design standards, smart-grid technologies, energy generation diversification, distributed generation (e.g., roof-top solar, microgrids), energy efficiency, demand management, pumped hydro storage, battery storage and improved capacity to respond to supply deficits and balance variable energy resources across the network (Table 11.8) (high confidence). With increasing electrification, diversification and resilience can contribute to security of supply as fossil fuels are retired from the energy mix (AEMO, 2020b). In Australia, the AEMO (2020) Integrated System Plan has evaluated various options, costs and benefits. Risks associated with an increasing reliance on weather-dependent renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind, hydro) (ESCI, 2021) can be managed through strong long-distance interconnection via high-voltage powerlines and storage (Blakers et al., 2017; Blakers et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2021). However, implementation of adaptation options remains inadequate (Gasbarro et al., 2016).Table 11.8 | Adaptation options for energy sector.Adaptation optionsReferencesDiversification of electricity supplies geographically and technically, including distributed energy resources and variable renewable energy(AEMO, 2020b)Integrated planning, improved asset design and management and disaster recovery to build resilience to more extreme weather(AEMO, 2020b; Transpower, 2020)Augmentation of transmission grid to support change in generation mix using interconnectors and renewable energy zones, coupled with energy storage, adds capacity and helps balance variable resources across the network(Blakers et al., 2017; ICCC, 2019; AEMO, 2020b)Climate change risks included in the design, location and rating of future infrastructure and consideration of the implications for future transmission developments(Bridge et al., 2018; AEMO, 2020b)Increased design and construction standards, flood defence measures, insurance, improved water efficiency, improved insulation of supercooled LNG processes, more efficient air conditioning and creating fire breaks for the oil and gas sector(Smith, 2013; Gasbarro et al., 2016)Technological developments to strengthen existing resilience under climate change that reinforce the relative advantage of western Australia and Tasmania for new wind energy installations(Evans et al., 2018)Energy generation diversity, demand management, pumped hydro storage and battery storage(Keck et al., 2019; Transpower, 2020)Tools and strategies to manage winter energy deficits and dry years alongside renewable electricity generation deployment(Transpower, 2020)Improved insulation and heating of buildings and flexible electricity consumption to reduce significance of winter electricity demand peak(Stroombergen et al., 2006; MBIE, 2019a; Transpower, 2020)
