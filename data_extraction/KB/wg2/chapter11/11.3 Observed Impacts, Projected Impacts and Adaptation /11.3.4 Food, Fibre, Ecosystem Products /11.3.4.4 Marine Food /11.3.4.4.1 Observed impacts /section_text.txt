The ecological impacts of climate change on fisheries species have already emerged (high confidence) (Morrongiello and Thresher, 2015; Gervais et al., 2021). This includes loss of habitats for fisheries species (Verg√©s et al., 2016; Babcock et al., 2019) and poleward shifts in the distribution of barrens-forming urchins (Ling and Keane, 2018) impacting abalone and rock lobster fisheries. The percentage of reef as barrens across eastern Tasmania grew from 3.4% to 15.2% from 2001/2002 to 2016/2017, an approx. 10.5% increase per annum over the 15-year period (Ling and Keane, 2018). Oysters farmed from wild spat (Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata) are most at risk from climate change, primarily due to observed increases in summer temperatures and heatwave-related mortalities (Doubleday et al., 2013). The exceptional 2017/2018 summer heatwave caused significant losses of farmed salmon in New Zealand, with farm owners seeking consent to move operations to cooler water (Salinger et al., 2019b).
