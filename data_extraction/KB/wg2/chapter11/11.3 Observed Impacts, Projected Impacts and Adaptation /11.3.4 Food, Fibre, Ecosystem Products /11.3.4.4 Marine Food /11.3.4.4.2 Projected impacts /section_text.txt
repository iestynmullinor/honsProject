Aquaculture is projected to be more easily adapted than wild fisheries to avoid excessive exposure to the physio-chemical stresses from acidification, warming and extreme events (Richards et al., 2015). In New Zealand, wild and cultured shellfish are identified as being most at risk from climate change (Capson and Guinotte, 2014). Changes in ocean temperature and acidification and the downstream impacts on species distribution, productivity and catch are projected concerns (medium confidence) (Law et al., 2016) that impact MƒÅori harvesting of traditional seafood and the social, cultural and educational elements of food gathering (mahinga kai) (MfE, 2016). Warm temperate hatchery-based finfish species (yellowtail kingfish Seriola lalandi) are projected to be the least at risk, because of well-controlled environmental conditions in hatcheries and temperature increases, which are expected to increase growth rates and productivity during the grow-out stage (Doubleday et al., 2013). For wild fisheries, multi-model projections suggest temperate and demersal systems, especially invertebrate shallow-water species, would be more strongly affected by climate change than tropical and pelagic systems (medium confidence) (Pecl et al., 2014; Fulton et al., 2018; Pethybridge et al., 2020). In New Zealand waters, available habitat for both albacore tuna and oceanic tuna (Cummings et al., 2021) is expected to widen and shift.
