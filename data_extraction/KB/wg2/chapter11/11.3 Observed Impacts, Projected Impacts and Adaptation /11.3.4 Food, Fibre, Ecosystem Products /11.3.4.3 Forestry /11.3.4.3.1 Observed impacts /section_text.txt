Climate change may have increased tree mortality in Australiaâ€™s commercial Eucalyptus globulus and Pinus radiata plantation forests (Crous et al., 2013; Pinkard et al., 2014). Climate warming enhanced tree water use and vulnerability to heat (Crous et al., 2013). Increases in fire frequency and intensity in forests of southern Australia are leading to diminishing resources available for timber production (Pinkard et al., 2014) (Box 11.1).
