Adaptation options include increased investment in monitoring forest condition and functioning; early detection and management of insect pests, diseases and invasive species; improved selection of land with appropriate growing conditions for plantation timber production under current and future conditions; trialling new species and genetic varieties; changing the timing and frequency of planned fuel reduction fires; introducing more fire-tolerant tree species where appropriate; reducing ignition sources; and maintaining access and emergency response capacity (Boulter, 2012; Pinkard et al., 2014; Keenan, 2017).
