Adaptations in both grazing and confined beef cattle systems require enhanced decision-making skills capable of integrating biophysical, social and economic considerations (high confidence). Social learning networks that support integration of lessons learned from early adopters and involvement with science-based organisations can help enhance decision-making and climate adaptation planning (Derner et al., 2018). Pasture management adaptations for livestock production include deeper rooted pasture species in higher rainfall regions (Cullen et al., 2014) and drought-tolerant species (Mathew et al., 2018). Soil and land management practices are important in ensuring soils maintain their supporting and regulating services (Orwin et al., 2015). Adaptations in the primary sector in New Zealand are now positioned within the requirements of the National Policy Statement on Freshwater (MfE, 2020b). Adaptations to manage heat stress in livestock include altering the breeding calendar, providing shade and sprinklers, altering nutrition and feeding times and more heat-tolerant animal breeds (Chang-Fung-Martel et al., 2017; Lees et al., 2019; van Wettere et al., 2021).Beef rangeland systems in Queensland are projected to have benefits in the southeast through higher CO2 and temperatures extending the growing season and reducing frost, but a warmer and drier climate in the southwest may reduce pasture and livestock production (Cobon et al., 2020). Northern Queensland is most resilient to temperature and rainfall changes (production limited by soil fertility) while western/central west Queensland is most sensitive to rainfall changes, that is, low rainfall is associated with lower productivity (Cobon et al., 2020). The social context of climate change impacts and the processes shaping vulnerability and adaptation, especially at the scale of the individual, are critical to successful adaptation efforts (Marshall and Stokes, 2014).
