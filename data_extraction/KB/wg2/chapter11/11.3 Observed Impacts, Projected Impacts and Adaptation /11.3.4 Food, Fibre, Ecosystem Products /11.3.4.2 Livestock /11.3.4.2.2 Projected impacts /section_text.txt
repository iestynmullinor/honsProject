Some areas may experience increased pasture growth, but others may experience a decrease that cannot be fully offset by adaptation (high confidence) (Moore and Ghahramani, 2013; Lieffering, 2016; Kalaugher et al., 2017). Climate change may modify the seasonality of pasture growth rates more than annual yields in New Zealand (Lieffering, 2016). In eastern parts of Queensland, climate change impacts on pasture growth are equivocal, with simple empirical models suggesting a decrease in net primary productivity (Liu et al., 2017), while mechanistic models that include increases in length of the growing season and the beneficial effects of CO2 fertilisation indicate increases in pasture growth (Cobon et al., 2020). In Tasmania, annual pasture production is projected to increase by 13–16%, even with summer growth projected to decline with increased interannual variability, resulting in a projected increase in milk yields by 3–16% per annum (Phelan et al., 2015).Extreme climatic events (droughts, floods and heatwaves) are projected to adversely impact productivity for livestock systems (medium confidence). This includes reduced pasture growth rates between 3–23% by 2070 from late spring to autumn and elevated growth in winter and early spring (Cullen et al., 2009; Hennessy et al., 2016; Chang-Fung-Martel et al., 2017). Heavy rainfall and storms are projected to lead to increased erosion, particularly in extensively grazed systems on steeper land, reducing productivity for decades, reducing soil carbon (Orwin et al., 2015) and increasing sedimentation. Increased heat stress in livestock is projected to decrease milk production and livestock reproduction rates (high confidence) (Nidumolu et al., 2014; Ausseil et al., 2019b; Lees et al., 2019). In Australia, the average number of moderate to severe heat stress days for livestock is projected to increase 12–15 d by 2025 and 31–42 d by 2050 compared to 1970–2000 (Nidumolu et al., 2014). In New Zealand, an extra 5 (RCP2.6) to 7 (RCP8.5) moderate heat stress days per year are projected for 2046–2060 (high confidence) (Ausseil et al., 2019b), which would especially affect animals transported long distances (Zhang and Phillips, 2019) and strain the cold chains needed to deliver meat and dairy products safely. The distribution of existing and new pests and diseases are projected to increase, for example, new tick- and mosquito-borne diseases such as bovine ephemeral fever (Kean et al., 2015).
