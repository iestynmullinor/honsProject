Both the seasonality and annual production of pasture is changing (high confidence). In many regions, warming is increasing winter pasture growth (Lieffering, 2016); the effects on spring growth are more mixed, with some regions experiencing increased growth (Newton et al., 2014) and others experiencing reduced spring growth (Perera et al., 2020). Droughts are causing economic damage to livestock enterprises, with drought and market prices significantly affecting profit (Hughes et al., 2019a), in addition to the impacts on animal health and the livelihoods of pastoralists, periods of drought contribute to land degradation, particularly in the cattle regions of northern Australia (Marshall, 2015). Heat load in cattle leads to reduced growth rates and reproduction, and extreme heat waves can lead to death (Lees et al., 2019; Harrington, 2020). Temperatures over 32Â°C reduce ewe and ram fertility along with the birth weight of lambs (van Wettere et al., 2021).
