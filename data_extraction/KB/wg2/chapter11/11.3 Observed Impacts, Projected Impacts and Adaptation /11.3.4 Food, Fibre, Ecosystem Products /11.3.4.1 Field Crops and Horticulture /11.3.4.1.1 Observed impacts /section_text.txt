Drought, heat and frost in recent decades have shown the vulnerability of Australian field crops and horticulture to climate change (Cai et al., 2014; Howden et al., 2014; CSIRO and BOM, 2015; Lobell et al., 2015; Hughes and Lawson, 2017; King et al., 2017; Webb et al., 2017; Harris et al., 2020) as recognised by policymakers (CoA, 2019a) (high confidence). Northern Australiaâ€™s agricultural output losses are on average 19% each year due to drought (Thi Tran et al., 2016). In southern Australia, the frequency of frost has been relatively unchanged since the 1980s (Dittus et al., 2014; Pepler et al., 2018; BoM and CSIRO, 2020 ). Drier winters have increased the irrigation requirement for wine grapes (Bonada et al., 2020), while smoke from the 2019/20 fires, which occurred early in the season, caused significant taint damage (Jiang et al., 2021). In New Zealand, reduced winter chill has a compounded impact on the kiwifruit industry, resulting in early harvest and increased energy demand for refrigeration and port access problems (Cradock-Henry et al., 2019) (11.5).Across all types of agriculture, drought and its physical flow-on effects have caused financial and emotional disruption and stress in farm households and communities (Austin et al., 2018; Bryant and Garnham, 2018; Yazd et al., 2019) (11.3.6). Severe and uncertain climate conditions are statistically associated with increases in farmer suicide (Crnek-Georgeson et al., 2017; Perceval et al., 2019). Rural women often carry extra stress and responsibilities, including increased unpaid and paid work and emotional load (Whittenbury, 2013; Hanigan et al., 2018; Rich et al., 2018).
