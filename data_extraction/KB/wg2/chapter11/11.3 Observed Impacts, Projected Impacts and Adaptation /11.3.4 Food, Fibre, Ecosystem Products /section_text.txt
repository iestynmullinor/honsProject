Selective breeding in oysters is projected to be an important global adaptation strategy for sustainable shellfish aquaculture that can withstand future climate-driven change to habitat acidification (Fitzer et al., 2019). Less than a quarter of fisheries management plans for 99 of Australiaâ€™s most important fisheries considered climate change, and only to a limited degree (Fogarty et al., 2019; Fogarty et al., 2021). Implementation of management and policy responses to climate change have lagged in part because climate change has not been considered as the most pressing issue (Hobday and Cvitanovic, 2017; Fogarty et al., 2019; Fogarty et al., 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box MOVING SPECIES in Chapter 5).
