Climate change is having major impacts on the region’s oceans (very high confidence) (Table 11.6) (Law et al., 2016; Sutton and Bowen, 2019). Rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have exacerbated marine heatwaves, notably near western Australia in 2011, the GBR in 2016, 2017 and 2020 and the Tasman Sea in 2015/2016, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 (Table 11.2) (BoM and CSIRO, 2018 ; AMS, 2019; NIWA, 2019; Salinger et al., 2019b; Sutton and Bowen, 2019; BoM, 2020; Salinger et al., 2020; Oliver et al., 2021). Temperature anomalies ranged from 1.2°C to 4.0°C and durations ranged from 90–250 days (Table 11.2).Table 11.6 | Observed climate-change-related changes in the marine ecosystems of Australia and New Zealand.

Thomsen et al., 2019; Salinger et al., 2020)Ocean carbon storage and acidification has led to decreased surface pH in the region (Table 11.2), including the sub-Antarctic waters off the East Coast of New Zealand’s South Island (very high confidence) (Law et al., 2016). The depth of the Aragonite Saturation Horizon has shallowed by 50–100 m over much of New Zealand, which may limit and/or increase the energetic costs of growth of calcifying species (low confidence) (Anderson et al., 2015; Bostock et al., 2015; Mikaloff-Fletcher et al., 2017).In the estuaries of southwestern Australia, sustained warming and drying trends have caused dramatic declines in freshwater flows of up to 70% since the 1970s and increased frequency and severity of hypersaline conditions, enhanced water column stratification and hypoxia and reduced flushing and greater retention of nutrients (Hallett et al., 2017).Extensive changes in the life history and distribution of species have been observed in Australia’s (very high confidence) (Gervais et al., 2021) and New Zealand’s marine systems (medium confidence) (Table 11.6) (Cross-Chapter box MOVING SPECIES in Chapter 5). New occurrences or increased prevalence of disease, toxins and viruses are evident (de Kantzow et al., 2017; Condie et al., 2019), along with heat stress mortalities and changes in community composition (Wernberg et al., 2016; Zarco-Perello et al., 2017; Thomsen et al., 2019). Extreme climatic events in Australia from 2011 to 2017 led to abrupt and extensive mortality of key habitat-forming organisms — corals, kelps, seagrasses and mangroves — along over 45% of the continental coastline of Australia (high confidence) (Babcock et al., 2019).In 2016 and 2017, the GBR experienced consecutive occurrences of the most severe coral bleaching in recorded history (very high confidence) (Box 11.2), with shallow-water reef in the top two-thirds of the GBR affected and the severity of bleaching on individual reefs tightly correlated with the level of local heat exposure (Hughes et al., 2018b; Hughes et al., 2019c). Mass mortality of corals from these two unprecedented events resulted in larval recruitment in 2018 declining by 89% compared to historical levels (Hughes et al., 2019b). southern reefs were also affected by warming, although significantly less than in the north (Kennedy et al., 2018). Coral reefs in Australia are at very high risk of continued negative effects on ecosystem structure and function (very high confidence) (Hughes et al., 2019b), cultural well-being (very high confidence) (Goldberg et al., 2016; Lyons et al., 2019), food provision (medium confidence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017), coastal protection (high confidence) (Ferrario et al., 2014) and tourism (high confidence) (Deloitte Access Economics, 2017; Prideaux and Pabel, 2018; GBRMPA, 2019). If bleaching persists, an estimated 10,000 jobs and AUD$1 billion in revenue would be lost per year from declines in tourism alone (Swann and Campbell, 2016).
