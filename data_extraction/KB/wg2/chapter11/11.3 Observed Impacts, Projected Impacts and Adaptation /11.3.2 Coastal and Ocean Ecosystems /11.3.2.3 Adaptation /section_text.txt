Climate change adaptation opportunities and pathways have been identified across aquaculture, fisheries, conservation and tourism sectors in the region (MacDiarmid et al., 2013; Fleming et al., 2014; MPI, 2015; Jennings et al., 2016; MfE, 2016; Royal Society Te Apārangi, 2017; Ling and Hobday, 2019), and some stakeholders are already autonomously adapting (Pecl et al., 2019). Some fishing and aquaculture industries use seasonal forecasts of environmental conditions to improve decision-making, risk management and business planning (Hobday et al., 2016), with the potential to use 5-yearly forecasts similarly (Champion et al., 2019). Shifts in the distribution and availability of target species (e.g., oceanic tuna) would impact the ability of domestic fishing vessels to continue current fishing practices, with potential social and economic adjustment costs (Dell et al., 2015), including disruption to supply chains (Fleming et al., 2014; Plagányi et al., 2014) (Cross-Chapter Box MOVING SPECIES in Chapter 5). Species abundance data are insufficient to enable projections of climate impacts on fishery productivity. However, fishery and aquaculture industries are considering adaptation strategies, such as changing harvests and relocating farms (Pinkerton, 2017). Thus, while climate change is extremely likely  to affect the abundance and distribution of marine species around New Zealand, insufficient monitoring means there is limited evidence of ecosystem level change in biodiversity to date and no quantitative projections of which species may win and lose to climate change (Table 11.6) (Law et al., 2018a; Law et al., 2018b).
