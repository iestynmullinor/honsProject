Coordinating adaptation strategies and addressing underlying exposure and vulnerability can increase resilience to cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts (high confidence) (Table 11.17; 11.7.3). Systems understanding, network analysis, stress testing, spatial mapping, collaboration, information sharing and interoperability across states, sectors, agencies and value chains, as well as national-scale facilitation, can increase adaptive capacity (Espada et al., 2015; CoA, 2020e; Cradock-Henry et al., 2020b; Jozaei et al., 2020). Greater system diversity, modularity, redundancy, adaptability and decentralised control can reduce the risk of cascading failures and system breakdown (Sinclair et al., 2017; Sellberg et al., 2018). Addressing existing vulnerabilities in systems can reduce susceptibility and improve the resilience of interdependent systems (11.7.3). Multi-level leadership, including national and sub-national policies, laws and finance can reduce and manage aggregate risks supported by the enablers in Table 11.17.Anticipatory governance and agile decision-making can build resilience to cascading, compounding and aggregate impacts (high confidence) (Boston, 2016; Deloitte, 2016; Steffen et al., 2019; CoA, 2020e; CSIRO, 2020; Lawrence et al., 2020b; MfE, 2020c). There is uncertainty about whether standard integrated assessment models can estimate cascading and compounding impacts across systems and sectors, but systems methodologies and social network analysis hold promise (Stoerk et al., 2018; Cradock-Henry et al., 2020b). Interventions at the landscape, building and individual scales can reduce the negative health effects of current and future extreme heat, if integrated in well-communicated heat action plans with robust surveillance and monitoring (Jay et al., 2021).In Australia, the National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework (CoA, 2018b), National Recovery and Resilience Agency and Australian Climate Service (CoA, 2021) can provide some support for adaptation across multiple sectors. New Zealand has effective partnerships across critical infrastructure through lifelines groups, but organisational silos and lack of stress testing of plans hamper coordinated decision-making during crises and for adaptation (Brown et al., 2017; Lawrence et al., 2020b). The New Zealand national risk assessment, national adaptation plan, forthcoming Climate Change Adaptation Act and monitoring of adaptation progress by the Climate Change Commission provide a framework for anticipating climate change risks (MfE, 2020a).
