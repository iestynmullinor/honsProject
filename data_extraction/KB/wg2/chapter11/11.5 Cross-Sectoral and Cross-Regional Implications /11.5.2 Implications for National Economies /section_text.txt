Investments in mitigation and adaptation can help reduce or prevent economic losses now and in the coming decades (IPCC, 2018; Steffen et al., 2019); however, the costs and benefits of mitigation and adaptation are not well understood in the region (high confidence) (CSIRO, 2019; MfE, 2020a).In New Zealand, the emphasis has been on rebuilding after climate disasters, rather than anticipatory adaptation (Boston and Lawrence, 2018). Australia is similarly focused on disaster response and recovery, even though investment in disaster resilience can provide a cost:benefit ratio of 1:2 to 1:11 through reduced post-disaster recovery and reconstruction (GCA, 2019). Recent Australian and state government spending on direct recovery from disasters was around AUD$2.75 billion per year, compared to funding for natural disaster resilience of approximately AUD$0.1 billion per year  (Deloitte, 2017b). The Australian government is supporting most of the 80 recommendations from the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements, including establishing a disaster advisory body and a resilience and recovery agency (CoA, 2020e; CoA, 2020b). Australia and New Zealand provide humanitarian and disaster assistance across the Pacific, which is increasingly focused on climate adaptation and the SDGs (Brolan et al., 2019) as cyclones and floods become amplified by climate change (Fletcher et al., 2013) (Table 11.3). Climate change may increase current migration flows to and impacts on diaspora in Australia and New Zealand from near-neighbour island nations as they become increasingly stressed by rising seas, higher temperatures, more droughts and stronger storms (Nalau and Handmer, 2018).Delaying adaptation to climate risks may result in higher overall costs in future when adaptation is more urgent and impacts more extreme (medium confidence) (Boston and Lawrence, 2018; IPCC, 2018). Estimates of the magnitude of adaptation costs and benefits in the region are localised and sectoral (e.g., (Thamo et al., 2017) or regionally aggregated (Joshi et al., 2016). Adaptation costs are expected to increase markedly for higher RCPs, for example, a tripling of expected costs between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 for sea level rise (SLR) protection in Australia (Ware et al., 2020). Existing governance arrangements for funding adaptation are inadequate for the scope and scale of climate change impacts anticipated; dedicated funding mechanisms that can be sustained over generations can enable more timely adaptation (Boston and Lawrence, 2018).
