The WGII AR5 identified—with high confidence—a range of factors that could enable or limit planning and implementation of adaptation options and potentially their effectiveness (Klein et al., 2014; Mimura et al., 2014; Noble et al., 2014). These included governance, finance, knowledge and capacity as enabling factors, as well as cultural, social, political and economic differences that influence individual and collective willingness and capability to act. The AR6 Special Reports (specifically, de Coninck et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2019; Hurlbert et al., 2019) reinforced the AR5 findings, further noting that the transitions needed for climate resilient development would need to be supported by radical shifts in governance, knowledge development, technology application, finance and economics, and social norms.This section builds on the AR5 and AR6 Special Reports by reviewing new evidence on three key enablers identified in the AR5: governance, finance and knowledge. The focus is on assessing new evidence on (i) understanding of these enabling conditions, (ii) how they have changed on the ground and (iii) whether these conditions have enabled progress on adaptation and risk management. The section also addresses an emerging related topic: the role of catalysing conditions and actors in accelerating action on climate change adaptation, such as litigation on failure to adapt, understandings of urgency, and the aftermath of extreme weather events. While enabling conditions are necessary for action, they are not by their presence enough; catalysing conditions emerge when game-changing circumstances become present, such as when a high-profile extreme weather event occurs or when a champion drives change in an organisation.
