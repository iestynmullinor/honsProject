Finance has long been recognised as an important enabling and catalysing factor for adaptation, climate resilient development and climate risk management. In Chapter 17, financing for adaptation and climate risk management is covered in the extended Cross-Chapter Box, Financing for Adaptation and Resilience (FAR), below. The Cross-Chapter Box aims to highlight key emerging evidence on financing of adaptation, covering both public and private sources and instruments. Climate finance is also covered in a dedicated chapter in the WGIII Report (WGIII AR6 Chapter 15 (Kreibiel et al., 2022)), and readers should refer to this chapter for a more comprehensive assessment of this subject from both a mitigation and adaptation perspective.
