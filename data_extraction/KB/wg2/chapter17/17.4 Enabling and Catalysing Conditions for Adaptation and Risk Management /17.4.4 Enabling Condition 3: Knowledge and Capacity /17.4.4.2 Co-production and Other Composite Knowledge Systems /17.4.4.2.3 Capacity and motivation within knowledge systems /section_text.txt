Knowledge of climate change influences decision-making not only by providing information but also by increasing the motivation to act and by promoting behaviour change. Evidence from many sectors (including water (Section 4.5.2), ocean and coastal ecosystems (Section 3.6.2), and agriculture (Section 5.4.2) and regions (including Africa [Section 9.8.4], Asia [Section 10.4.6] and North America [Section 10.4.5] shows that building capacity (e.g., adaptive capacity, institutional capacity, education/training in human capacity) can support adaptation and limited governance capacity can constrain it (high confidence). An emerging area of research examines the contribution of building capacity within public and technical organisations and agencies to draw on Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (Adger et al., 2017; Hochman et al., 2017; Bacud, 2018). A number of factors influence the effect of knowledge on motivation and behaviour change, including values and education.Decision makers who shape options for managing climate risk can evaluate stakeholders’ capacities and motivations to participate in the implementation process of these options. Stakeholder engagement in climate change risk management supports successful adaptation (Gray et al., 2014; Elsawah et al., 2015; Siders, 2017; Giordano et al., 2020). Research in psychology and related fields shows that the cognitive mechanisms by which individuals and organisations process climate information influence this capacity, motivation and engagement (Grothmann and Patt, 2005; Grothmann et al., 2013; Masud et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2016; Takahashi et al., 2016; Hügel and Davies, 2020; Grothmann and Michel, 2021).The perception of climate change as a major threat that requires action has increased since AR5, reflecting both the growth of information about climate change and the processing of that information (Lee et al., 2015; Fagan and Huang, 2019). Global social movements play an important role in raising public awareness of climate urgency (Thackeray et al., 2020). Climate change concern plays an important role in decision-making outcomes which entail public participation (Lammel, 2015; Chiang, 2018; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019; Arıkan and Günay, 2020). Nonetheless, public risk perception varies sharply on spatial and temporal scales, reflecting environmental changes, social influences (Kousser and Tranter, 2018; Rousseau and Deschacht, 2020), economic capacities (Arıkan and Günay, 2020) and culture (Noll et al., 2020), as well as individual characteristics (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019). The importance of values and norms is demonstrated by recent research which highlights how intrinsic motivation (altruistic, self-transcendental and eco-centric values) (Corner et al., 2014; Braito et al., 2017; Xiang et al., 2019; Bouman et al., 2020) and extrinsic social motivation (e.g., economic gains and social desirability) (van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019) can drive action.Recent research shows the importance of education as a predictor of risk perception, motivation and action. Education level is the strongest predictor of public awareness of climate change risk in a study across 119 countries of public awareness of climate change risk (Lee, 2015), though this relationship varies in different nations, and is influenced by mediating variables (Muttarak and Chankrajang, 2015; Blennow et al., 2016) (Ballew et al., 2020). Knowledge and awareness of climate change are correlated with the motivation to undertake action on climate change (Hornsey and Fielding, 2017). The integration of climate science in educational curricula has been shown to be effective (Hess and Maki, 2019; Molthan-Hill et al., 2019), including approaches such as integration of the complex system approach (Jacobson et al., 2017), experiential climate change education (Siegner, 2018), including climate games (O’Garra et al., 2021; Pfirman et al., 2021), massive open online courses and informal science learning centres (Geiger et al., 2017).Attention to behavioural change of individuals has grown since AR5, including cases which address both adaptation and mitigation (e.g., dietary changes, modification of buildings, transport alternatives) (Azadi et al., 2019; Fischer, 2019; Willett et al., 2019; Sharifi, 2020; Sharifi, 2021). The interventions to promote behavioural change can be bottom-up, initiated by individuals, communities, non-governmental organisations or the private sector, or top-down, coming from governments at various levels (Robertson and Barling, 2015; Stern et al., 2016). They are supported by a number of mechanisms, including education, information strategies, and campaigns, financial incentives, regulatory processes and legislation (Rosenow et al., 2017; Creutzig et al., 2018; Carlsson et al., 2019). These behavioural changes contribute significantly to effective risk management.
