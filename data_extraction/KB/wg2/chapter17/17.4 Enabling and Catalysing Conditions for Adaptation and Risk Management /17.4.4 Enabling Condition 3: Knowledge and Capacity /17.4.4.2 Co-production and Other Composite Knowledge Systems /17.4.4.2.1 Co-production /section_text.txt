The co-production of knowledge by different actors provides important avenues for exchanging and integrating climate-related knowledge in decisions made across society (high confidence). Though many definitions of co-production have been offered in recent years (Bremer and Meisch, 2017; Vincent et al., 2018; Bremer et al., 2019; Harvey et al., 2019a), most describe a set of individuals or organisations who work together to generate a set of products that entail new knowledge products and that guide action (Miller and Wyborn, 2020). Some major forms of co-production include action research (Baztan et al., 2017; Laursen et al., 2018; Zanocco et al., 2018a), trans-disciplinarity (Howarth and Monasterolo, 2016; Wamsler, 2017; Lanier et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2018; Knapp et al., 2019; Young et al., 2019), rapid assessment processes (Atkinson et al., 2018b) and participatory integrated assessments (Howarth et al., 2018; Krkoška Lorencová et al., 2018; Bitsura-Meszaros et al., 2019; Carter et al., 2019a; Cremades et al., 2019; Leitch et al., 2019; Martínez-Tagüeña et al., 2020; Section 17.3.1.3.1).Co-production promotes iterative dialogue, experimentation, the tailoring of knowledge to context, needs and priorities, and learning, often promoting integration of Indigenous knowledge, local knowledge and practitioner knowledge with scientific knowledge (high confidence). It generally entails long-lasting ties and fully inclusive partnerships between different parties (Kench et al., 2018). Governance measures and adequate financing can act as enablers of such co-production. This integration is most extensive, and promotes a wider consideration of alternatives where governance arrangements promote ongoing exchanges of information and discussion of solutions, whether through formal mechanisms such as regional committees (Gim et al., 2019; Ostovar, 2019; Rasmus et al., 2020; Zarei et al., 2020) or informal mechanisms such as personal networks and local discussion groups (Madsen et al., 2019; Yumagulova and Vertinsky, 2019). Where such arrangements are absent, practitioner knowledge is side-lined from the formulation and implementation of decisions (Orleans Reed et al., 2013; Aguilar-Barajas et al., 2019; Matsler, 2019; Ramsey et al., 2019).An important mechanism of co-production is the boundary organisation, a knowledge-producing organisation composed of individuals who reflect different disciplines or knowledge systems and who represent different activities, sectors or forms of governance (Blades et al., 2016; Graham and Mitchell, 2016; Guido et al., 2016; Jeuring et al., 2019; Serrao-Neumann et al., 2020; Zarei et al., 2020). Boundary organisations themselves can be linked into boundary chains (Lemos et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2015; Kirchhoff et al., 2015a; Pretorius et al., 2019; Daniels et al., 2020). When individuals and organisations from different disciplinary backgrounds and missions coordinate their activities informally, the resulting ties have been termed ‘knowledge networks’ (Ziaja and Fullerton, 2015; Brugger et al., 2016; Guido et al., 2016; Davies et al., 2018; Klenk, 2018; Muccione et al., 2019; Ziaja, 2019). When such networks interact with each other, the resulting associations have been called ‘communities of practice’, which can work to collectively shape information to shared contextual circumstances (Orsato et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019b).There is extensive evidence that co-production can generate useful climate knowledge (Djenontin and Meadow, 2018; Bisbal, 2019; Ryan and Bustos, 2019; Hewitt et al., 2020; Jack et al., 2020; Lavorel et al., 2020; Ruiz-Mallén, 2020) and that it can increase the likelihood that knowledge will be used in decision-making (Vogel et al., 2016; Prokopy et al., 2017; Skelton et al., 2017; Sylvester and Brooks, 2020). Co-production is not without its costs, since it requires more time, money, facilitation expertise and personal commitment from participants than more conventional modes of knowledge production (Lemos et al., 2018; Sletto et al., 2019; Wamsler et al., 2019; Blair et al., 2020). Some research has shown ways to decrease the costs of co-production for participants, such as funding and time to enable and sustain interactions and to build trust and legitimacy, or to create boundary organisations (Young et al., 2016; Klenk et al., 2017).Co-production is supported by project cycles that provide for the involvement of stakeholders from the outset (Daly and Dilling, 2019; Brady and Leichenko, 2020); flexible research agendas that do not assume a climate related question (Daniels et al., 2020); support for interactivity and reflexivity (Araujo et al., 2020); and institutionalising incentives which address the different values, norms, perceptions and work patterns of scientists, policymakers and civil society representatives (Cvitanovic et al., 2015; Vincent et al., 2015; Bruno Soares and Dessai, 2016; Singh et al., 2017; Djenontin and Meadow, 2018; Norström et al., 2020; Turnhout et al., 2020). Certain roles, such as policy entrepreneurs (Tanner et al., 2019), embedded researchers (Pretorius et al., 2019) and knowledge brokers (Cvitanovic et al., 2015), can facilitate co-production.
