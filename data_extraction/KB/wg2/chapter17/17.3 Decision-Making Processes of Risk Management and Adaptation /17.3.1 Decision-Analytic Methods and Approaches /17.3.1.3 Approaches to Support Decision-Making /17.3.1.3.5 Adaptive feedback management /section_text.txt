Iterative decision-making requires that the implementation of adaptations be reviewed to determine whether the adaptation effectively achieved the objectives, and whether adjustments or additional actions were required (Section 17.5). Adaptive feedback management is an approach to managing dynamic climate risks by designing a field monitoring programme to provide data to an assessment procedure which in turn advises on what adjustments need to be made to a ‘control action’, all of which are part of the adaptation to be implemented (Hurlbert et al., 2019; Figure 17.7). Adaptive feedback management is more able to account for the dynamic nature of risk and the future emergence of unforeseen risks because of the active design of how to adjust the management approach (Dickey-Collas, 2014).Adaptive feedback management is important for managing climate risks that fall within the Cynefin context of chaos, relying on observations and indicators to learn about the system and to trigger actions (medium confidence) (Helmrich and Chester, 2020). It has been a valued approach for managing wildfish fisheries in many oceans (high confidence) (Fulton et al., 2019; Hollowed et al., 2020; Bahri et al., 2021) and is important for responding to the challenges of climate change (high confidence) (Holsman et al., 2019; Hollowed et al., 2020; Bahri et al., 2021).While the benefits of investment in data and assessments can outweigh the costs of implementation (low confidence) (Fulton et al., 2019), the implementation may take time when resources are limited, particularly in developing nations, where low-cost approaches will be needed for deciding on pathways for adaptation (Bhave et al., 2016; Shortridge et al., 2016).Iterative decision-making and adaptive feedback management meet when the feedback management procedure is reviewed in total for its effectiveness in one of the review and adjustment iterations. At present, a common approach for assessing different adaptation options and their interaction is using, for example, scenarios in dynamic models (Adam et al., 2014; Girard et al., 2015). An emerging field in adapting fisheries to climate change is to embed the decision-making system in the scenario models in order to assess the capability of feedback management (decision-making, monitoring and capacity for adjustment of the options over time) to achieve satisfactory trade-offs among the objectives of the different stakeholders (medium confidence) (Melbourne-Thomas et al., 2017; Holsman et al., 2019; Hollowed et al., 2020). This method can enable prospective evaluation of future whole-of-management scenarios described in this chapter.
