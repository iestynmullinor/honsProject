Scenarios are described in SR1.5 (IPCC, 2018a) and SRCCL (IPCC, 2019b) as a description of how the future may develop based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about key driving forces (e.g., rate of technological change, prices) and relationships. Scenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts but are used to provide narratives and trajectories equipped with alternate outcomes. SR1.5 and the SRCCL describe a range of scenarios methods and how scenarios are used to guide risk management decision-making. Scenario analysis includes a range of potential future conditions from low-end and mid-range to high-end projections. Scenarios can also include a temporal component, that is, short term, medium term and long term, as defined in the SROCC (IPCC, 2019c).Scenarios and pathways, combined with elicitation methods, are becoming widely used to assess adaptation and resilience strategies (high confidence) (Butler et al., 2016; Prober et al., 2017; Symstad et al., 2017; Lawrence et al., 2019; Phan et al., 2019; Sperotto et al., 2019; Haasnoot et al., 2020a). They can support the consideration of a wide range of alternative possible futures (Catenacci and Giupponi, 2013; JÃ¤ger et al., 2018), enabling identification of potential path dependencies caused by adaptation options (high confidence) (Pretorius, 2017; Haasnoot et al., 2020a). They can also increase the willingness of stakeholders to consider costly actions, by placing them within broader sequences of action (limited evidence) (Barnett et al., 2014). The development, consideration and understanding of scenarios can be enhanced by using visualisation tools to better display storylines, enabling the discussion of alternative futures by participants in decision-making processes (limited evidence) (Winters et al., 2016).
