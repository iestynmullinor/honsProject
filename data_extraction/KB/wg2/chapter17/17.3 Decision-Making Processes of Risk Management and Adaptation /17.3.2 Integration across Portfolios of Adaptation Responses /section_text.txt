In recent years, methods for simultaneously considering multiple societal and sectoral objectives, climate risks and adaptation options have been emerging, often termed ‘integrated’ approaches (Hadka et al., 2015; Garner et al., 2016; Rosenzweig et al., 2017; Giupponi and Gain, 2017a; Stelzenmuller et al., 2018; Marchau et al., 2019). Different decision-making approaches can be complementary (Kwakkel et al., 2016), and multiple approaches will be needed to manage risks across sectors, in space and over short to long time scales (Section 17.6).Higher-level integration was first presented in the IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) (Burton et al., 2012; Lal et al., 2012; O’Brien et al., 2012) and includes concepts of planning, coordination and mainstreaming (Lal et al., 2012), consideration of cross-scale dynamics and nested vulnerabilities (Klein et al., 2014), and decision-making across governments and sectors (Denton et al., 2014; Mimura et al., 2014).Since AR5, recognition of the importance of using integrated adaptation to improve climate risk management across the nexus between many sectors and across regions has increased (high confidence) (Harrison et al., 2016; Challinor et al., 2018). This was highlighted in the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (Hurlbert et al., 2019); advanced planning and integration of adaptation responses are needed over many levels (medium confidence) (Göpfert et al., 2019; Section 17.6; Woodruff and Regan, 2019). The complexity of managing this nexus may be compounded by the potential for antagonistic or synergistic effects among and between climate impacts, and changes arising from local sectoral activities and independent adaptation responses to those risks (high confidence) (Crain et al., 2008; Piggott et al., 2015; Adger et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2018; Stelzenmuller et al., 2018; Simpson et al., 2021), such as the cross-sectoral demands for freshwater (Xue et al., 2015; Azhoni et al., 2018). Integrated adaptation will also help facilitate management of new and emerging risks, help identify when response plans may need to be changed in light of the dynamics of risk over time, and help identify solutions that are less likely to constrain future options for adapting to future needs (Wise et al., 2016).Implicit to managing cross-sectoral interactions, including the nexus concept, is that the interlinkages between multiple sectors are systemic, and therefore solutions to challenges arising from any one sector can only be satisfactorily addressed by considering the connections to other sectors at the same time (Wichelns, 2017). Challenges for integrated adaptation include: (1) to sufficiently capture the complexities between the nexus dimensions (Weitz et al., 2017); (2) to adequately consider the time, costs and challenges of coordination and cooperation (Wichelns, 2017); (3) to consider the political economy in which progress towards more integrated solutions could take place, not only accounting for technological requirements (Leck and Roberts, 2015); (4) to obtain sufficient temporal or spatial data to capture the interactions between natural and social processes (Shannak et al., 2018); (5) to connect these considerations to decision-making and policy processes in order to gain insights into the conditions for collaboration and coordination across sectors, including external dynamics and political and cognitive factors determining change (Weitz et al., 2017); and (6) to develop a coherent framework against which to assess results and observations (Crain et al., 2008; Wichelns, 2017).
