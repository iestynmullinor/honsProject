The complex, interacting and compounding nature of climate risks means that single risks cannot be managed in isolation (very high confidence) (Section 16.5, Figure 16.11; Section 17.3.2; Nhamo et al., 2018), including accounting for potential risks arising from adaptations (Simpson et al., 2021). Regional examples of needs for cross-sectoral integrated management include the water–energy–food nexus in Africa (Section 10.5.1), Asia (Section 10.6.3), Australasia (Section 11.6), Europe (Section 13.2.2) and North America (Table 14.8), and ecosystem-oriented adaptations and/or nature-based solutions, in Africa (Section 9.6.5), Asia (Section 10.4.2), Australasia (Box 11.4, Section 11.3.5), Central and South America (Section 12.5.1), Europe (Section 13.3.2), North America (Section 14.6.1, Box 14.3) and Small Islands (Section 15.5.4). The cross-sectoral interactions within humans systems, including impacts on cities, settlements and infrastructure, are reflected in those subjects as well as for health in Africa (Section 9.10.2), Asia (Section 10.4.5), Australasia (Section 11.3.6), Central and South America (Section 12.5.6), Europe (Section 13.7.2), North America (Section 14.6.1) and Small Islands (Section 15.6.2), and poverty and livelihoods in Africa (Section 9.11.3), Asia (Sections 10.4.5, 10.5), Australasia (Section 11.4), Central and South America (Section 12.5.7), Europe (Section 13.8.2), North America (Section 14.6.1) and Small Islands (Section 15.3.4).These examples demonstrate that the emergence of climate risks can be at different rates and different time horizons, and the interactions between risks vary from region to region (very high confidence). The need to manage these risks in an integrated manner is readily identified in the water–energy–food nexus (Box 9.5). However, in terms of climate resilient development, the need for integration is demonstrated by the diverse and interacting impacts of climate risks on ecosystems (Sections 2.7, 3.6), cities (Sections 6.2.3, 6.2.4, Boxes 6.2, 6.3), health (Section 7.4), and poverty and livelihoods (Section 8.6).
