This chapter has assessed and detailed a number of decision-making tools (Section 17.3) and enabling mechanisms and catalysing conditions (Section 17.4) that could be used in mainstreaming the management of climate risk and adaptation in the sustainable development of communities, different sectors and nations. Since AR5, the challenges facing the management of climate risks have been articulated (Adger et al., 2018; Balasubramanian, 2018), and greater clarity on the steps that could be taken to better mainstream adaptation has been developed (high confidence) (Cuevas, 2016; Giupponi and Gain, 2017a; Gomez-Echeverri, 2018; Sanchez Rodriguez et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the choice of decision processes is recognised as being dependent on a variety of local factors influencing development (Ayers et al., 2014; Szabo et al., 2016).Adaptation strategies or plans, some of which incorporate elements of climate resilient development, have been developed in many jurisdictions from local (Cuevas, 2016; Araos et al., 2016a; Reckien et al., 2018a; Göpfert et al., 2019) to provincial/state (Warnken and Mosadeghi, 2018) to national governments (Markolf et al., 2015; CSIRO, 2018; Warnken and Mosadeghi, 2018; Brown et al., 2018 a; Table 17.8). National Adaptation Plans have been a requirement under the UNFCCC and establish the general approach taken by nations for adapting to climate change (Woodruff and Regan, 2019). Integrated risk assessments and adaptation processes are being developed but with much less experience evident in their implementation (high confidence) (Wise et al., 2014; Woodruff and Stults, 2016; Brown et al., 2018 a).National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) submitted to the UNFCCC have been reviewed for quality by Woodruff and Regan (2019). In their review, Woodruff and Regan used a number of indicators grouped within established ‘quality principles’. They found that the plans were more oriented at the strategic level or at the level of specific projects rather than identifying methods for resolving cross-sectoral or cross-jurisdictional interactions or issues (medium confidence). A key recommendation from their review and supported by other studies (e.g., Abutaleb et al., 2018) is that plans would be improved greatly by having inputs from multiple government agencies and multiple sectors (medium confidence), which could provide the basis for planning and review of integrated adaptation. Also, the plans need greater attention to implementation (Sections 9.4.1, 11.8, 13.11.2), and the identification of metrics by which success (Section 17.5.1) and performance can be measured (Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter), a common issue for adaptation planning generally (e.g., Sections 12.5.2.6, 17.5).Hence, satisfactorily managing intersecting climate risks in different settings, of which RKRs provide examples, is central to achieving sustainable development (high confidence) (Section 16.6.4), requiring integrated risk management within and across regions, jurisdictions, sectors and ecosystems (high confidence) (see CCP5.4.2, CCP5.4.3). Iterative processes will enable measuring progress and updating adaptation at a satisfactory rate, to account for the different needs within regions and across sectors at different times (high confidence). The degree to which equity and justice will be achieved will be determined by the participatory processes in deciding on suitable adaptation options, the investment in the adaptation processes and the coordination and collaboration built among institutions and people across regions (high confidence).
