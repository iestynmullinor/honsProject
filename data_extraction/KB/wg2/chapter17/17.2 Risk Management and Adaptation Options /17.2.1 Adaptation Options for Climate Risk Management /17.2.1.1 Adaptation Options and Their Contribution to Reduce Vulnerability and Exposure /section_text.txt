Table 17.1 provides examples of each of these 24 adaptation options from across AR6 WGII. Detailed information about sectors and regions where these adaptations are being discussed can be found in the indicated chapters. Note that this list is curated to ensure a diversity of options; therefore, most of the options will apply to more than one RKR.Of this list of adaptation options, many focus on reducing vulnerability to climate change (high confidence), as vulnerability is one of the components of risk (see Chapter 1 and Chapter 8). Vulnerability is the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt (see Chapter 1 for more details). In the world’s threatened ecosystems, reducing vulnerability often means reducing other non-climate negative pressures on ecosystems, such as pesticide use or fishery overexploitation (Section 3.3).Vulnerability reduction is also a major focus in human systems, and this includes development of investments that help people adapt to climate change. Examples include irrigation or diversifying crops. Building infrastructure resilient to climate-related risks is another example; many of the structural and physical adaptation options can reduce sensitivity to disasters, such as elevating houses or doing beach nourishment in coastal areas (Section 15.5). Extreme events often catalyse investment in adaptation to reduce vulnerability for the future (Kreibich et al., 2017; Slavíková et al., 2021).Next to vulnerability reduction, a large number of adaptation options focus on reducing exposure to climate change (high confidence). Selecting low-risk locations is the most basic example of reducing exposure; for example, private companies are relocating factories to reduce flood-related disruptions to their supply chain (Neise and Revilla Diez, 2019), and species are autonomously adjusting their ranges to a changing climate (Section 2.4). Land use planning or investing in resilient infrastructure can avoid exposure in rapidly urbanising areas; however, the design and enforcement of these regulations can negatively impact marginalised people (Anguelovski et al., 2016).Managed retreat is an example of exposure reduction that, while often controversial, is increasingly being considered and implemented (CCP 2.2.2, Section 15.3.4; Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in this Chapter; Siders et al., 2019). Examples include the US Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which, among other activities, has helped people resettle outside of flood zones, and a ‘no-build zone’ established in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan (Hino et al., 2017). However, relocation is not always an option; immobility is sometimes involuntary, such as in the case of ‘trapped’ populations in Zambia (Nawrotzki and DeWaard, 2018; Section 8.2.1.3).Adaptation efforts can have negative impacts on ecosystems and vulnerable groups (high confidence); see Figure 17.3 and Section 17.5 for further information on maladaptation. While ‘hard’ structural investments have been popular to reduce exposure to climate extremes, barrier-type measures provide protection only up to a certain limit, and are designed to fail in more extreme events. Given the risk of catastrophe from a climate extreme overcoming a physical barrier, policy advancements in recent years encourage any investment in structural measures to be complemented by ‘softer’ vulnerability reduction measures, such as accommodating building construction (Wesselink, 2016).When it comes to ‘softer’ vulnerability reduction initiatives, these were traditionally seen as ‘no regrets’ options for adaptation. However, subsequent studies have cautioned that notion as vulnerability is a dynamic quality, and can be co-created while development or adaptation efforts are being implemented (Schipper and Pelling, 2006; Tempels and Hartmann, 2014; Dilling et al., 2015). Some scholars have suggested the application of a ‘do no harm’ principle to climate change adaptation efforts (Mayer, 2016).Table 17.1 |  Selected adaptation options per Representative Key Risk (RKR; see Section 16.5.2.2), with examples of each option from across the report. Many of the adaptation options are relevant to multiple RKRs, and have been selected to be representative of the wide variety of adaptation options implemented or suggested around the world.RKRAdaptation optionExamples from regional and sectoral chapters and cross-chapter papersRisk to coastal socio-ecological systemsCoastal accommodationRaising of dwellings, raising of coastal roads (Section 15.5.2), amphibious building designs (CCP2), improved drainage (Section 11.3.5.3)Coastal infrastructureSeawalls, beach and shore nourishment (Sections 3.6, 15.5.1), breakwater structures (Section 15.5.1), dykes, revetments, groynes or tidal barriers.
