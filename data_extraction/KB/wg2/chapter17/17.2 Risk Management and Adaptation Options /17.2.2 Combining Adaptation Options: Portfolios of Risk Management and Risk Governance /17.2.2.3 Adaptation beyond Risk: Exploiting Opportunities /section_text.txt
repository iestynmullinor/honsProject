Several studies and many government planning documents reference how people can benefit from a changed climate, beyond reducing risks. For example, several regions are expecting an increase in visitors to eco-tourism sites or national parks with a changing climate (Fisichelli, 2015; Lwasa, 2015). In Europe, several national adaptation plans include planning for potential benefits of a changing climate, including reduced winter mortality and improved conditions for hydropower (Biesbroek et al., 2010). Recognising the need for economic diversification, people working in certain industries, such as coastal management, perceive climate change as a factor increasing the need for their services (FatoriÄ‡ et al., 2017). Northern countries are taking advantage of ice-free waters for shipping routes in the Arctic (Eguiluz et al., 2016; Melia et al., 2016; IPCC, 2019c). In Africa, opportunistic adaptation has been observed by smallholder farmers, to plant crops that are better suited for a changing climate (Lalou et al., 2019). Similar agricultural adaptation in Pakistan has been associated with improved food security and reduced poverty (Ali and Erenstein, 2017; Rahman et al., 2020). In each of these cases documenting benefits, there are also potential negative impacts on other populations or ecosystems, such as ecosystem impacts from increased Arctic shipping (Ng et al., 2018).While adaptation is rarely focused on taking advantage of opportunities presented by a changed climate, there are numerous co-benefits of adaptation opportunities, from health to reduced emissions to ecosystem services (high confidence) (Watts et al., 2015; Geneletti and Zardo, 2016; Spencer et al., 2016). There is also literature proposing that the actual process of adaptation planning can enable people to take advantage of opportunities, including, for example, opportunities for larger policy and governance reform (Coleman and Sandhu, 1965; Ernst and Preston, 2017; Brown et al., 2017a).
