This chapter assesses the evidence of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) (see AR6 Glossary, Annex II) and their approaches as part of the adaptation process at the national, local and project level as well as in global assessments (Section 17.5.2; Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter). M&E can serve multiple functions, for example, to: (1) facilitate an understanding on whether and how interventions work in achieving intended objectives; (2) inform ongoing and future implementation; and (3) provide information that helps to substantiate upward and downward accountability (Preston et al., 2009; UNFCCC, 2010b; Pringle, 2011; Spearman and McGray, 2011) (see BOX 17.1 for more discussion). This chapter also addresses the relevance of iterative learning as part of the design of M&E processes, as a means by which actors and institutions engaged in M&E acquire new insights on how these processes work (or not) to achieve set objectives.
