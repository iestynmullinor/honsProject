In AR6 (Chapter 16 and cross-chapter papers), over 100 key risks have been identified across regions and sectors, which have the potential to manifest into severe impacts that are relevant to the interpretation of UNFCCC Article 2, specifically on the objective to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. These risks are likely 2  to become more severe under higher warming scenarios and social-ecological conditions that yield high exposure and vulnerability to the associated climate-related hazards. In this report, these key risks have been grouped into categories represented by eight overarching risks (called Representative Key Risks, RKRs) relating to: (1) coastal socio-ecological systems; (2) terrestrial and ocean ecosystems; (3) critical physical infrastructure, networks and services; (4) living standards; (5) human health; (6) food security; (7) water security; and (8) peace and human mobility (Chapter 16). Decision-making options for managing these risks, such as selecting the relevant adaptation options to implement, require an assessment of the local context in which these impacts are likely to be experienced, as well as the local to global collective implications of those actions (Sections 17.2 and 17.5).
