Adaptation responses have been observed in every region and across a wide variety of sectors (Section 16.3), but little evidence exists of their outcomes in terms of climate risk reduction (high confidence) (Section 1.4.3; Ford and Berrang-Ford, 2016; Tompkins et al., 2018; Berrang-Ford et al., 2021; Eriksen et al., 2021; UNEP, 2021a). To advance on that, the Paris Agreement is encouraging countries to engage in ‘Monitoring and evaluating and learning from adaptation plans, policies, programmes and actions’ (UN, 2015, Article 7.9d). Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is the systematic process of collecting, analysing and using information to assess the progress of adaptation and evaluate its effects—for example, risk reduction outcomes, co-benefits and trade-offs—mostly during and after implementation (AR6 Glossary, Annex II). Distinctions between monitoring and evaluation typically view monitoring as a continuous process of tracking implementation and informing management to allow for corrective action including in situations of deep uncertainty (see Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in this Chapter), while evaluation is described as a more comprehensive assessment of achievements, unintended effects and lessons learned carried out at certain point in time (OECD, 2002). M&E is an important part of the adaptation process (Figure 1.9). It can help to generate information on adaptation success or maladaptive outcomes.M&E of adaptation is undertaken for different purposes, including: (1) understanding whether responses have achieved their intended objectives and contributed to a reduction in climate risks and vulnerability or to an increase of adaptive capacity and resilience, (2) informing ongoing implementation and future responses, and (3) providing upward and downward accountability (Preston et al., 2009; UNFCCC, 2010a; Pringle, 2011; Spearman and McGray, 2011). M&E is also commonly linked to learning (Section 17.5.2.7). By continuously monitoring implementation, for example, to assess whether adaptation is on track or needs to be accelerated, M&E can aid decision-making under uncertainty. Adaptation M&E is distinct from tracking financial flows related to adaptation since financial accounting does not provide information on implementation and outcomes (Section 17.5.2.5; Adaptation Partnership, 2012; World Bank Independent Evaluation Group, 2012).
