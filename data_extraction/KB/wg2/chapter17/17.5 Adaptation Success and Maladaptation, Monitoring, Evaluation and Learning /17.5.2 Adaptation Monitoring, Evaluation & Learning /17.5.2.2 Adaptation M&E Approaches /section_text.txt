Adaptation M&E can be conducted for various purposes and in a wide variety of different contexts ranging from the local to the global level (McKenzie Hedger et al., 2008; UNFCCC, 2010a; Spearman and McGray, 2011). The context and specific purpose of M&E determine what information needs to be generated, and together with the available resources also determine the suitability of particular approaches and methods (Leiter, 2016; Leiter, 2017). Several frameworks and approaches have been proposed for M&E of adaptation and climate resilience (Bours et al., 2014d; Schipper and Langston, 2015; Adaptation Committee, 2016; ODI, 2016; Cai et al., 2018; Gregorowski et al., 2018), including sector-specific ones for agriculture (FAO, 2017; FAO, 2019a; FAO, 2019b), health (Ebi et al., 2018), ecosystem-based adaptation (Donatti et al., 2018; Donatti et al., 2020; GIZ, 2020) and cities (Section 6.4.6).Adaptation M&E generally seeks to answer whether implementation is taking place and what effects it has (Figure 17.12). Accordingly, M&E can focus on the processes, activities and outputs or on their outcomes and ultimate impacts (Harley et al., 2008; Pringle, 2011; Ford et al., 2013). Most of the available guidance for the development of adaptation M&E systems is aimed at the household, local or project level (Pringle, 2011; Villanueva, 2012; Olivier et al., 2013; CARE, 2014; BRACED, 2015; Leiter, 2016; Jones, 2019b) with only limited guidance for national or cross-sectoral M&E systems (Price-Kelly et al., 2015) or frameworks that are applicable at different scales (Brooks et al., 2014). The available guidebooks take users through a series of steps which are synthesised in Figure 17.12.Figure 17.12 | Adaptation M&E and learning as part of the adaptation process (based on Hammill et al. , 2014a; Price-Kelly et al., 2015; Leiter, 2016). This figure shows the main steps involved in developing an adaptation M&E system where the context informs the purpose of M&E, which in turn determines the information needs. To achieve the M&E purposes, the chosen approach and data sources need to be able to generate the needed information, which needs to be communicated in a suitable way to the target audiences.Open figure The majority of adaptation M&E efforts have so far focused on processes and outputs rather than on achieved outcomes such as climate risks, vulnerability, well-being or development (Droesch et al., 2008; GIZ and Adelphi, 2017; UNDP Cambodia, 2014; Fawcett et al., 2017) (high confidenc e) or use a combination thereof (Brooks et al., 2011; Brooks et al., 2014). Newly emerging approaches include perception-based measurements and the use of data collected via mobile phones (Jones et al., 2018; Jones, 2019a), which can be collected frequently (Clare et al., 2017a; Knippenberg et al., 2019; Jones and Ballon, 2020). Such advances call into question the common reliance on ‘objective’ indicators defined from an external perspective. Instead, they suggest that multiple complementary approaches combined with higher-frequency data collection produce a more elaborate picture of the effects of adaptation and resilience responses (Jones and d’Errico, 2019; Knippenberg et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2019; Jones, 2019a; see Cross-Chapter Box PROGRESS in this Chapter) (medium confidence).Central to designing, monitoring and evaluating adaptation responses is outlining how activities are expected to lead to intended objectives, for example, via a theory of change (Bours et al., 2014c; Oberlack and al., 2019). Theories of change or similar change models provide a basis to decide what to measure, but more attention needs to be paid to how theories of change are constructed and who is involved (Mason and Barnes, 2007; Forsyth, 2018). Participatory approaches can support understanding how climate risks affect the respective population, how these risks interact with social and cultural processes, and how responses could most effectively address climate risks (Conway et al., 2019). Inclusive M&E systems can facilitate ownership and enhance the meaningfulness and usability of the generated information (CARE, 2014; Faulkner et al., 2015). Meaningfulness is not associated with a particular approach or method but depends on whether the chosen M&E design fits the M&E purpose and the information needs of the intended audience (Fisher et al., 2015; Leiter, 2017). Effective communication of M&E findings and feedback into decision-making processes is essential to achieve the respective M&E purpose and facilitate learning (Section 17.5.2.7).
