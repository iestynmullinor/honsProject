Most adaptation M&E frameworks and tools proposed to date refer to monitoring rather than evaluation (high confidence) (Adaptation Committee, 2016). Evaluations are envisioned to go beyond monitoring by examining how and why results have been achieved and what could be improved (Brousselle and Buregeya, 2018; Vähämäki and Verger, 2019). Evaluations of adaptation outcomes are still rare, particularly quantitative impact evaluations (Weldegebriel and Prowse, 2013; Das, 2019; Béné et al., 2020). Impact evaluations of adaptation need to address several methodological as well as practical challenges (Dinshaw et al., 2014; Fisher et al., 2015; Béné et al., 2017; Puri et al., 2020). Different types of evaluations are appropriate for different evaluation questions (Silvestrini et al., 2015). Evaluations of the available evidence of effective adaptation, in particular topics or sectors, have emerged more recently, for instance on mainstreaming (Runhaar et al., 2018) and agricultural climate services (Vaughan et al., 2019a). Impact evaluations of capacity building measures are important because capacity building is assumed to lead to adaptation, but its actual effects are seldom examined (Mortreux and Barnett, 2017; Alpizar F and Meiselman, 2019). If well designed and utilised for learning, evaluations can play an important role in improving adaptation responses (Hildén, 2011).Learning requires information about how and why change occurred and what experiences have been made (Feinstein, 2012). M&E is frequently associated with learning, but it is rarely made explicit how learning is supposed to take place (Armitage et al., 2008; Baird et al., 2015; Borras and Hølund, 2015). The design of adaptation M&E systems can support learning by gathering relevant information and disseminating it in a way that is accessible and effectively linked to decision-making processes (Spearman and McGray, 2011; Villanueva, 2012; Fisher et al., 2015). Options include institutionalised feedback mechanisms, peer learning and knowledge sharing events, a learning culture and ways to gather in-depth insights beyond indicators (ibid; Oswald and Taylor, 2010). Since AR5, adaptation programmes and funds such as the BRACED programme, the Adaptation Fund, the Climate Investment Funds and the Green Climate Fund have created knowledge-sharing units and provide resources to support learning activities (BRACED, 2015; Roehrer and Kouadio, 2015; Adaptation Fund, 2016; Leavy et al., 2018; CIF, 2020; Puri et al., 2020), but there is little information about their longer-term effectiveness.
