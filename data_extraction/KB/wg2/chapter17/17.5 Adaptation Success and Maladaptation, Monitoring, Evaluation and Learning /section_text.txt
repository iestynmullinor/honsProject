The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) introduced a methodology to track the amount of bilateral official development assistance (ODA) that is targeting climate change mitigation and/or adaptation. It distinguishes whether activities have adaptation as a ‘principal’ objective (score ‘2’), as a ‘significant’ objective (score ‘1’) or as not targeting it (score ‘0’) (OECD, 2016). The associated project value is counted in full, in part, or not counted as adaptation finance, respectively. Countries count the volume of partial adaptation projects (score ‘1’) to a different extent, which limits comparability and can lead to over-reporting (OECD, 2019). The first data on this ‘adaptation marker’ became available in 2012 for the financial flows of 2010. It forms the basis for developed countries’ reporting to the UNFCCC Secretariat on their financial commitments towards developing countries (Weikmans and Roberts, 2019).While a guidebook with requirements for adaptation as a principle or significant objective has been developed (OECD, 2016), several studies have shown that OECD DAC donors tend to overestimate the number of activities in their portfolio that genuinely have adaptation objectives (Michaelowa and Michaelowa, 2011; Weikmans et al., 2017; CARE, 2021). Hence, the amount of adaptation finance from public sources may be lower than reported. The use of just three categories leads to a broad range of the extent of adaptation being concentrated in the middle category (‘significant objective’). Accordingly, the category ‘principle objective adaptation’ provides a more robust predictor of the relevance of an activity to adaptation (Donner et al., 2016).
