As the most populous continent, Asia is faced with a unique set of challenges that vary across its climatic zones:The most perceptible change in climatic trends is observable in the increasing surface air temperature and rise in nighttime temperature, particularly during winter. This is accompanied by monsoon rainfall variability, which is observable interseasonally, interannually and spatially.There is increasing evidence of an upwards trend in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events in Asia.The predictions for future climatic trends suggest an increase in warming along the higher latitudes of North Asia.Projections show that agricultural and food security will be impacted substantially, particularly in the area of cereal production, by the end of the 21st century.Malnutrition among the poor and marginalised sections of the population in Asia remains a major concern that is further rendered complex by climate change.Projections of an increase in the incidence of pests and diseases impact directly on the food security and health of vulnerable populations.Erosion will occur simultaneously with SLR. The projected rise could lead to large-scale flooding in low-lying areas, particularly South, Southeast and East Asia.The erosion of the major deltas of Asia may take place through a rise in sea levels, an increased frequency of extreme weather events and the excessive withdrawal of groundwater.The priority areas for Asia include an enhancement of capabilities to collect social and biophysical data, information sharing, sectoral interactions, a mainstreaming of science and the identification of critical climate thresholds across regions and sectors.Drawing upon a greater number of studies made possible by greater use of advanced research tools, such as remote sensing as well as meticulous modelling of impacts, the Fifth Assessment Report could significantly expand its coverage of pertinent issues (IPCC, 2014c). For example, the discussion on the Himalayas was expanded to cover observed and projected impacts of climate change on tourism (WGII AR5 Section 10.6.2); livelihood assets such as water and food (WGII AR5 Sections 9.3.3.1, 13.3.1.1, 18.5.3, 19.6.3); poverty (WGII AR5 Section 13.3.2.3); culture (WGII AR5 Section 12.3.2); flood risks (WGII AR5 Sections 18.3.1.1, 24.2.1); health risks (WGII AR5 Section 24.4.6.2); and ecosystems (WGII AR5 Section 24.4.2.2; IPCC, 2014b, 2014c).Over the past century, and across most of Asia, warming trends and increasing temperature extremes have been observed.Adequate supplies of freshwater resources are under considerable threat due to both the existing pattern of socioeconomic growth and climate change.With a number of regions already close to the heat stress limits, most models, using a range of general circulation models (GCMs) and Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) scenarios, suggest that higher temperatures will lead to shorter growing periods of rice cultivation, resulting in lower rice yields.Climate-change impacts have led to visible shifts on the terrestrial systems in many parts of Asia in the phenologies, growth rates and distributions of plant species.Coastal and marine systems in Asia are under increasing stress from both climate-impact drivers (CIDs) and non-climate drivers, and mean SLR will contribute to upwards trends in extreme coastal high water levels (WGI AR5 Section 3.7.6) (Rhein, et al., 2013). Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass beds may decline unless they can move inland, while coastal freshwater swamps and marshes will be vulnerable to saltwater intrusion with rising sea levels. Damage to coral reefs will increase during the 21st century because of both warming and ocean acidification.Climate change will further compound multiple stresses caused due to rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and economic growth. Development of sustainable cities in Asia with fewer fossil-fuel-driven vehicles and with more trees and greenery would have a number of co-benefits, including improved public health.Extreme climate events will have an increasing impact on human health, security, livelihoods and poverty, with the type and magnitude of impact varying across Asia.Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (IKLK) play an important role in the formulation of adaptation governance and related strategies (IPCC, 2007), and best quality, locality-specific knowledge can help address serious lack of education on climate change and uncertainties surrounding quality, salience, credibility and legitimacy of the available knowledge base.Knowledge and research gaps identified in AR5 include, but are not limited to, an insufficient understanding of the impacts, vulnerability and adaptation in urban settlements, under-researched linkages between local livelihoods, ecosystem functions and land resources, and a poor understanding of the impacts of projected climate changes on the vegetation of the lowland tropics.
