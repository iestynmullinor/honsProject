Ecosystems in Asia are characterised by a variety of climate and topographic effects, and can be divided into several distinct areas (Figure 10.3). In addition, valuable ecosystem services provide vital support for human well-being and sustainable development (IPBES, 2018).Figure 10.3 | Terrestrial ecoregions, large marine ecosystems and major fishing areas of Asia. Large marine ecosystems: 26Mediterranean Sea; 32Arabian Sea; 33Red Sea; 34Bay of Bengal; 35Gulf of Thailand; 36 South China Sea; 37 Sulu-Celebes Sea; 38Indonesian Sea; 47East China Sea; 48Yellow Sea; 49Kuroshio Current; 50 Sea of Japan; 51Oyashio Current; 52 Sea of Okhotsk; 53West Bering Sea; 54Northern Bering and Chukchi seas; 56East Siberian Sea; 57Laptev Sea; 58Kara Sea; 62Black Sea. Developed after Olson et al. (2001), NOAA (2010) and FAO (2019), and made with Natural Earth. Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset archive available athttps://www.naturalearthdata.com/. The software used for generating the map was ArcGIS 10.0. Note that the map is for illustrative purposes only.Open figure Boreal forests and tundra dominate in North Asia: deserts and xeric shrublands in Central and West Asia; and alpine ecosystems in the HKH, Tian Shan, Altai-Sayan, Ural and Caucasus mountain regions. Human-transformed landscapes occupy most parts of other sub-regions. The remaining natural ecosystems in East Asia are temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, and there are subtropical evergreen forests, deserts and grasslands in the West Asia. South Asia has tropical forests and semi-deserts in the northwest, and Southeast Asia is covered mainly by tropical forests (Figure 10.3).Ocean and coastal regions in Asia have various ecological characteristics, such as high productivity in arctic and subpolar regions, large biodiversity in tropical regions and unique systems in marginal seas. In the atlas of WGI AR6, the ocean biomes in Asia are divided into six sub-regions (WGI AR6 Figure Atlas.4) (Gutiérrez et al., 2021). For the coastal region, the concept of the large marine ecosystem (e.g., see Sherman, 1994) provides the biological characteristics of each marginal/semi-enclosed region and the regions characterised by boundary current system.Biodiversity and ecosystem services play a critical role in socioeconomic development as well as the cultural and spiritual fulfilment of the Asian population (IPBES, 2018). For example, species richness reaches its maximum in the ‘coral triangle’ of Southeast Asia (central Philippines and central Indonesia) (IPCA, 2017), and the extent of mangrove forests in Asia is about 38.7% of the global total (Bunting et al., 2018). These coastal ecosystems provide multiple ecosystem services related to food production by fisheries/aquaculture, carbon sequestration, coastal protection and tourism/recreation (Ruckelshaus et al., 2013).
