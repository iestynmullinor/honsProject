According to a quantitative scenario assessment for future water supply and demand in Asia to 2050, based on global climate change and socioeconomic scenarios (Satoh et al., 2017), water demand in sectors such as irrigation, industry and households will increase by 30â€“40% around 2050 in comparison with 2010. Water stress is likely  to be more pronounced in Pakistan, and northern parts of India and China. By mid-21st Century, the international transboundary river basins of Amu Darya, Indus, Ganges could face severe water scarcity challenges due to climatic variability and changes acting as stress multipliers (high confidence). Within a country as well, the water scarcity could be exacerbated, such as in India and China, due to various drivers like population increase and climate change. Research on the differentiated impacts of climate change on freshwater sources across the Asian sub-regions remains inconclusive and requires assessment at the sub-regional scale (IPCC, 2014b; Wester et al., 2019).
