There is hardly any mention about the impacts of climate change on livestock production in the Asia chapter of AR5 due to limited studies on this area. This scarcity of information persists to the current assessment with very scant information on the projected impacts and adaptation aspects of livestock production (Escarcha et al., 2018a). The use of scenarios and models to determine alternative futures with participatory engagement processes has been recommended for informed policy and decision making with potential application in the livestock sector (Mason-D’Croz et al., 2016). Of the limited assessment available, a study on the smallholders’ risk perceptions of climate change impacts on water-buffalo production systems in Nueva Ecija, the Philippines, identified feed availability and animal health as the production aspects most severely affected by multiple weather extremes (Escarcha et al., 2018b). In the Mongolian Altai Mountains, early snowmelt and an extended growing season have resulted in reduced herder mobility and prolonged pasture use, which has in turn initiated grassland degradation (Lkhagvadorj et al., 2013a). Furthermore, reduced herder mobility has increased the pressure on forests resulting in increased logging for fuel and construction wood and reduced regeneration due to browsing damage by increasing goat populations (Khishigjargal et al., 2013; Dulamsuren et al., 2014).In terms of direct impacts, climate-change-induced heat stress and reduced water availability are likely  to generally have negative effects on livestock (ADB, 2017b). In the HKH region, climate change has induced severe impacts on livestock through degradation of rangelands, pastures and forests (Hussain et al., 2019). However, indirect effects may be positive such as in Uzbekistan and South Asia where alfalfa and grassland productivity is expected to improve under warming conditions, which have beneficial effects on livestock production (Sutton et al., 2013; Weindl et al., 2015).At the global level, analysis involving 148 countries in terms of the potential vulnerability of their livestock sector to climate and population change shows that some Asian nations, particularly Mongolia, are likely  to be the most vulnerable while South Asia is the most vulnerable region (Godber and Wall, 2014).
