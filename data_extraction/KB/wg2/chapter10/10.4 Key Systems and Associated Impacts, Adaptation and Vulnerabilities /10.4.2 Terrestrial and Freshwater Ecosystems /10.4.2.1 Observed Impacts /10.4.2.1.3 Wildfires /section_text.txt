Climate change, human activity and lightning determine increases in wildfire severity and area burned in North Asia (high detection with medium-to-low attribution to climate change). In North Asia, the extent of fire-affected areas in boreal forest can be millions of hectares in a single extreme fire year (Duane et al., 2021) and nearly doubled between 1970 and 1990 (Brazhnik et al., 2017). During recent decades, the number, area and frequency of forest fires increased in Putorana Plateau (north of Central Siberia), in larch-dominated forests of Central Siberia and in Siberian forests as a whole. This increase is in line with an increase in the average annual air temperature, air temperature anomalies, droughts and the length of fire season (Ponomarev et al., 2016; Kharuk and Ponomarev, 2017; Pospelova et al., 2017). The number of forest fires and damaged areas in Gangwon Province and the Yeongdong area in the 2000s increased by factors of 1.7 and 5.6, respectively, compared with the 1990s (Bae et al., 2020). Climate change is not the sole cause of the increase in forest fire severity (Wu et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2018d). Ignition is often facilitated by lightning (Canadell et al., 2021), and over 80% of fires in Siberia are likely  anthropogenic in origin (e.g., (Brazhnik et al., 2017). Gas field development and Indigenous tundra burning practices that may get out of control contribute to fire frequency in the forest–tundra of West Siberia (Adaev, 2018; Moskovchenko et al., 2020). Climate change in combination with socioeconomic changes has resulted in an increase in fire severity and area burned in South Siberia, and illegal logging increases fire danger in forest–steppe Scots pine stands (Ivanova et al., 2010; Schaphoff et al., 2016).
