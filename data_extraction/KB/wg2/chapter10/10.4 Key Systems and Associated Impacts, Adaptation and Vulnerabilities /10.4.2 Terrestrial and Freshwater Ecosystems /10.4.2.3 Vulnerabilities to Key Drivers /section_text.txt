Both natural and managed ecosystems, ecosystem services and livelihoods in Asia will potentially be substantially impacted by changing climate (Wu et al., 2018d). There will be increased risk for biodiversity, particularly many endemic and threatened species of fauna and flora already under environmental pressure from land-use change and other regional and global processes (Zomer et al., 2014; Rashid et al., 2015; Choi et al., 2019). Biomes shift not only serves as a signal of climate change but also provides important information for resources management and ecotone ecosystem conservation. A widespread upwards encroachment of subalpine forests would displace regionally unique alpine tundra habitats and possibly cause the loss of alpine species (Schickhoff et al., 2015). In North Asia, emissions from fires reduce forestsâ€™ ability to regulate climate. A warmer and longer growing season will increase vulnerability to fires, although fires can be attributed both to climate warming and to other human and natural influences. Recent field-based observations revealed that the forests in South Siberia are losing their ability to regenerate after fire and other landscape disturbances under a warming climate (Brazhnik et al., 2017). Data support the hypothesis of a climate-driven increase in fire frequency in boreal forests with the possible turning of boreal forests from a carbon sink to a carbon source (Ponomarev et al., 2016; Schaphoff et al., 2016; Brazhnik et al., 2017; Ponomarev et al., 2018); however, warming resulting from forest fire is partly offset by cooling in response to increased surface albedo of burned areas in a snow-on period (Chen and Loboda, 2018; Chen et al., 2018a; Jia et al., 2019; Lasslop et al., 2019).
