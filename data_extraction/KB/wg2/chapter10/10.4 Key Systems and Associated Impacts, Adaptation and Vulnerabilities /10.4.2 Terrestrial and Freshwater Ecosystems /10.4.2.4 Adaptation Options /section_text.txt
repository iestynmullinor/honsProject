Modelling of the interactions between climate-induced vegetation shifts, wildfire and human activities can provide keys to how people in Asia may be able to adapt to climate change (Kicklighter et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2020). Conservation and sustainable development would benefit from being tailored and modified considering the changing climatic conditions and shifting biomes, mountain belts and species ranges (Pörtner et al., 2021). Expanding the nature reserves would help species conservation; to facilitate species movements across climatic gradients, an increase in landscape connectivity can be elaborated by setting up habitat corridors between nature reserves and along elevational and other climatic gradients (Brito-Morales et al., 2018; D’Aloia et al., 2019; United Nations Climate Change Secretariat, 2019). Assisted migration of species should be considered for isolated habitats as mountain summits or where movements are constrained by poor dispersal ability. Introducing seeds of the species to new regions will help to protect them from the extinction risk caused by climate change (Mazangi et al., 2016). In Asian boreal forests, a strategy and integrated programmes should be developed for adaptation of the forests to global climate change, including sustainable forest management, firefighting infrastructure and forest fuel management, afforestation, as well as institutional, social and other measures in line with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15 ‘Life on Land’ (Isaev and Korovin, 2013; Kattsov and Semenov, 2014; Bae et al., 2020). Improvements in forest habitat quality can reduce the negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem services (Choi et al., 2021). Adaptation options for freshwater ecosystems in Asia include increasing connectivity in river networks, expanding protected areas, restoring hydrological processes of wetlands and rivers, creating shade to lower temperatures for vulnerable species, assisted translocation and migration of species (Hassan et al., 2020; Chapter 2). Reduction of non-climate anthropogenic impacts can enhance the adaptive capacity of ecosystems (Tchebakova et al., 2016).
