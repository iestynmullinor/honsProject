High temperatures affect mortality and morbidity in Asia (high confidence). In addition to all-cause mortality (Dang et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018e), deaths related to circulatory, respiratory, diabetic (Li et al., 2014b) and infectious diseases (Ingole et al., 2015), as well as infant mortality (Son et al., 2017), are increased with high temperature (high confidence). Increased hospital admissions (Giang et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2019) and ambulance transport (Onozuka and Hagihara, 2015) coincide with increased ambient temperature (high confidence). Heatwaves are particularly detrimental to all-cause and cause-specific mortality (Chen et al., 2015a; Lee et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2017b; Yin et al., 2018). Both rural and urban populations are vulnerable to heat-related mortality (Ma et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2016a; Wang et al., 2018a). Individuals with lower degrees of education and socioeconomic status, older individuals and individuals living in communities with less green space are more susceptible to heat-related mortality (high confidence) (Yang et al., 2012a; Huang et al., 2015b; Seposo et al., 2015; Son et al., 2016; Kim and Kim, 2017 ). These heat effects have been attenuating over recent decades in East Asian countries, although the driving force behind this remains unknown (high confidence) (Chung et al., 2017c; Chung et al., 2018).Rising ambient temperature accelerates pollutant formation reactions and may modify air-pollution-related health effects (medium confidence). Higher temperatures are associated with the increased effects of ozone on mortality (Shi et al., 2020). Climate change causes intensified droughts and greater wind erosion resulting in increased intensity and frequency of sand and dust storms (Akhtar et al., 2018). Mortality and hospital admissions for circulatory and respiratory diseases are increased after exposures to Asian dust events (high confidence) (Hashizume et al., 2020). El Niño has a major influence on weather patterns in various regions. For example, it causes dry conditions that sometimes result in forest fires and transboundary haze that increased all-cause mortality in children by 41% in Malaysia (Sahani et al., 2014).Ambient temperature is associated with the risk of an outbreak of mosquito-borne disease in South and Southeast Asia (high confidence) (Servadio et al., 2018). Warmer climates are associated with a higher incidence of malaria (Xiang et al., 2018). Moderate rainfall also promotes malaria infection, while excessive rainfall decreases the risk of malaria (Wu et al., 2017b). El Niño intensity is positively associated with malaria incidence in a single year in India (Dhiman and Sarkar, 2017). The duration and survival rate of dengue mosquito development, mosquito density, mosquito biting activity, mosquito spatio-temporal range and distribution, and mosquito flying distance are all affected by temperature (high confidence) (Li et al., 2018b). Temperature, precipitation, humidity and air pressure are major weather factors associated with dengue fever transmission (high confidence) (Sang et al., 2014; Choi et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017).Climate change alters the hydrological cycle by increasing the frequency of extreme weather events such as excess precipitation, storm surges, floods and droughts (high confidence). Water-borne diseases, such as diarrhoea, leptospirosis and typhoid fever, can increase in incidence following heavy rainfall, tropical cyclones and flooding events (high confidence) (Deng et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018b; Matsushita et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019b). Droughts can cause increased concentrations of pathogens, which overwhelm water-treatment plants and contaminate surface water. A positive association between ambient temperature and bacterial diarrhoea has been reported, compared with a negative association with viral diarrhoea (Carlton et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018c).Asia has the highest prevalence of undernourishment in the world, which was 11.4% in 2017, representing more than 515 million people. Southeast Asia has been affected by adverse climate conditions such as floods and cyclones, with impacts on food availability and prices (FAO, 2018d). Crop destruction due to tropical cyclones can include salt damage from tides blowing inland (medium confidence) (Iizumi and Ramankutty, 2015). Sea level rises result in intrusion of saline water into the coastal area of Bangladesh and people living in this area face an increased risk of hypertension resulting from high salt consumption (Scheelbeek et al., 2016).Weather conditions have been linked to mental health. High temperatures increase the risk of mental problems including mental disorders, depression, distress and anxiety in Vietnam (Trang et al., 2016), Hong Kong SAR of China (Chan et al., 2018) and the Republic of Korea (Lee et al., 2018d). In addition, high temperatures are reported to increase the risk of mortality from suicide in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Province of China (Kim et al., 2016c), India (Carleton, 2017) and China (Luan et al., 2019). Extreme weather events, such as storms, floods, hurricanes and cyclones, increase injuries and mental disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive disorders) (Rataj et al., 2016), thereby negatively affecting well-being (high confidence).Higher temperatures and increased CO2 elevate the level of allergens such as pollen, which can result in increased allergic diseases, such as asthma and allergic rhinosinusitis. The association between variations in ambient temperature and the occurrence of asthma has been reported in several Asian countries/regions such as Japan (Yamazaki et al., 2015), the Republic of Korea (Kwon et al., 2016), China (Li et al., 2016a) and Hong Kong SAR of China (medium confidence) (Lam et al., 2016).
