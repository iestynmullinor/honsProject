The health co-benefits of GHG mitigation measures in energy generation have been reported to reduce disease burden. In China, the implementation of GHG policies would reduce the air-pollution-associated disease burden by 44% in 2020 under the Integrate Carbon Reduction scenario compared with the business-as-usual scenario (Liu et al., 2017b). Transition to a half-decarbonised power supply for the residential and transport sectors would prevent 55,000–69,000 deaths in 2030 compared with the business-as-usual scenario (Peng et al., 2018). A shift in travel modes from private motor vehicles to the use of mass rapid-transit lines is estimated to reduce CO2-equivalent emissions by 6% in greater Kuala Lumpur and bring important health co-benefits to the population (Kwan et al., 2017). The 25 measures developed for reducing air pollution levels in Asia and the Asia–Pacific in general would reduce CO2 emissions in 2030 by almost 20% relative to baseline projections and decrease warming by 0.3°C by 2050, which could eventually reduce heat-related excess deaths in the region (UNEP, 2019). The 25 measures include conventional emissions controls focusing on emissions that lead to the formation of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), next-stage air-quality measures for reducing emissions that lead to the formation of PM2.5 and are not yet major components of clean-air policies in many parts of the region, and measures contributing to development-priority goals with benefits for air quality. Health co-benefits outweigh mitigation costs in the Republic of Korea up to 2050 (Kim et al., 2020). Low-carbon pathways consistent with the 2°C and 1.5°C long-term climate targets defined in the Paris Agreement are associated with the largest health co-benefits when coordinated with stringent air pollution controls in Asia followed by Africa and Middle East (Rafaj et al., 2021).Strategies to increase energy efficiency in urban environments by compact urban design and circular-economy policies can reduce GHG emissions and reap ancillary health benefits; for example, compared with conventional single-sector strategies, national CO2 emissions can be reduced by 15–36%, and the annual deaths from 25,500 to 57,500 are avoidable from air pollution reduction in 637 Chinese cities (Ramaswami et al., 2017). In a city in China, the existing mitigation policies (e.g., promotion of tertiary and high-tech industry) and the one-adaptation policy (increasing resilience) increased the co-benefits for well-being (Liu et al., 2016a).Changing dietary patterns, particularly reducing red meat consumption and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, contributes to reduced GHG emissions as well as reduced premature deaths. The adoption of global dietary guidelines was estimated to prevent 5.1 million deaths per year relative to the reference scenario in which the largest number of avoidable deaths occurred in East Asia and South Asia, and GHG emissions would be reduced most in East Asia (Springmann et al., 2016). In China, dietary shifts to meet national dietary reference intakes reduced the daily carbon footprint by 5–28% depending on the scenario (Song et al., 2017). In India, the optimised healthy diets (e.g., lower amounts of wheat and increased amounts of legumes) could help reduce up to 30% water use per person for irrigation and reduce diet-related GHG emissions. This would result in 6800 life-years gained per 100,000 population in 2050 (Milner et al., 2017).
