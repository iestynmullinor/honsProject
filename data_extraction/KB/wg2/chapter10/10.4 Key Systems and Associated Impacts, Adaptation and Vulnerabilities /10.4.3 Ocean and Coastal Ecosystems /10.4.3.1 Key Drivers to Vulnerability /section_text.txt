The vulnerabilities to disaster in coastal regions with high population densities are reported in several studies (Sajjad et al., 2018) that have assessed the vulnerabilities of coastal communities along the Chinese coast and shown that roughly 25% of the coastline, and more than 5 million residents, are in highly vulnerable coastal areas of mainland China, and these numbers are expected to double by 2100. Husnayaen et al. (2018) assessed the Semarang coast in Indonesia and showed that 20% of the total coastline (48.7 km) is very highly vulnerable. Mangroves continue to face threats due to pollution, conversion for aquaculture, agriculture, apart from climate-based threats like SLR and sea erosion (Richards and Friess, 2016; Romañach et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018b; Friess et al., 2019). Hypersalinity, storm effects on sediment deposition, fishery development and land erosion are responsible for most of the Sunderban mangrove degradations leading to loss of livelihood (Uddin, 2014; Paul, 2017). In the Sunderbans of Asia, climate change is expected to increase river salinisation, which in turn could significantly negatively impact the valued timber species, Heritiera fomes (Dasgupta et al., 2017b). Augmented potential for honey production is also predicted, which could increase the conflict between humans and wildlife (Dasgupta et al., 2017b).Destruction by natural hazards was found to remove the above-ground C pool, but the sediment C pool was found to be maintained (Chen et al., 2018b). In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami severely impacted mangrove habitats at the Nicobar Islands (Nehru and Balasubramanian, 2018), although new inter-tidal habitats suitable for mangrove colonisation did develop. Mangrove species with a wide distribution and larger propagules showed high colonisation potential in the new habitats compared with other species (Nehru and Balasubramanian, 2018). Mangrove sites in Asia are predominantly minerogenic, so continued sediment supply is essential for the long-term resilience of Asia’s mangroves to SLR (Lovelock et al., 2015; Balke and Friess, 2016; Ward et al., 2016a; Ward et al., 2016b).
