There is growing empirical evidence of conditions enabling and constraining urban adaptation (Table 10.3) with relatively more literature from South, Southeast and East Asia. Governance and capacity-related deficits are repeatedly identified as significant barriers to urban adaptation (robust evidence, high agreement ) and interact with financial and informational constraints to mediate adaptation action.Table 10.3 | Barriers and enablers to climate adaptation across Asian citiesIndicatorAs an enablerAs a barrierGovernance and planningNational policy directives to adapt: for example, strong national climate commitments in China, India and Thailand (Dulal, 2019); and dedicated public–private councils on climate change in Seoul, Republic of Korea (Lee and Painter, 2015)Participatory planning, co-producing solutions and engaging multiple stakeholders: for example, Surat (Anguelovski et al., 2014; Karanth and Archer, 2014; Chu et al., 2017) and Guwahati (Archer et al., 2014) in India; Bandar Lampung and Semarang in Indonesia (Archer et al., 2014); and Seoul, Republic of Korea (Lee and Painter, 2015)Devolving decision making to city governments (ADB, 2013) and strong political leadership helps to institutionalise adaptation programmes (Anguelovski et al., 2014; Friend et al., 2014; Lee and Painter, 2015): for example, in Moscow where the city mayor has spearheaded climate action (van der Heijden et al., 2019).Mainstreaming climate adaptation  in city plans (UN-HABITAT and UNESCAP, 2018)Low accountability and transparency in planning processes with inadequate spaces for public dialogue (Friend et al., 2014) and limited accountability to the most economically and politically marginalised people within cities (Garschagen and Marks, 2019)Of 180 urban adaptation interventions across Asia, 65% are reactive in nature (Dulal, 2019), thus missing opportunities for risk prevention and preparedness (Francisco and Zakaria, 2019).Lack of forward-looking, learning-oriented processes constrain adaptation with short-term development priorities often overshadowing long-term climate-action needs (Friend et al., 2014; de Leon and Pittock, 2017; Gajjar et al., 2018; Khaling et al., 2018; Garschagen and Marks, 2019; Jain et al., 2021).Fragmented governance, lack of mainstreaming  between CCA and DRR (Fuhr et al., 2018; Khaling et al., 2018):  for example, in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia (Friend et al., 2014) and greater Manila (Meerow, 2017)InformationKnowledge sharing through transnational municipal networks such as C40, ACCRN and A-PLAT (Fünfgeld, 2015)City-level knowledge creation and knowledge-transfer institutions (Lee and Painter, 2015)Data gaps on projected climate risks and impacts in certain sub-regions and small settlements (Revi et al., 2014)Numerous tools for assessing vulnerability and adaptation planning (Nordgren et al., 2016)Technology and infrastructureEarly warning systems, climate information and modelling studies inform adaptation decision making (Reed et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2018a)Inadequate regional downscaled data at the city scale (ADB, 2013; Khaling et al., 2018);inadequate cost–benefit analyses of different adaptation strategies (Khaling et al. 2018)Capacity and awarenessA focus on learning, experimentation, awareness and capacity building leads to more sustained, legitimate and inclusive adaptation (ADB, 2013; Anguelovski et al., 2014; Reed et al. (2015) . Limited access to, and capacity to use, risk assessment tools (ADB, 2013; Shaw et al., 2016b)FinanceDedicated adaptation financing (e.g., in Beijing, adaptation spending is 0.33% of the city’s GDP) (Georgeson et al., 2016); steering international and local funding to leverage adaptation benefits in urban development programmes such as in Surat (India) (Cook and Chu, 2019); mainstreaming climate adaptation into development programming to leverage developmental finance for adaptation action (Cuevas et al., 2016; Narender and Sethi, 2018)Inadequate adaptation funding and lack of financial devolution to city governments (Fuhr et al., 2018; Garschagen and Marks, 2019)
