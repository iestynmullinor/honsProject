By 2050, urban areas are expected to add 2.5 billion people, 90% of whom will be in Asia and Africa (UNDESA, 2018). Critically, this urban population increase will be concentrated in India, China and Nigeria, with India and China adding 416 million and 255 million urban dwellers, respectively, between 2018 and 2050 (UNDESA, 2018).Asia is home to 54% of the world’s urban population, and by 2050, 64% of Asia’s 3.3 billion people will be living in cities. Asia is also home to the world’s largest urban agglomerations: Tokyo (37 million inhabitants), New Delhi (29 million) and Shanghai (26 million) are the top three with Cairo, Mumbai, Beijing and Dhaka home to nearly 20 million people each (UNDESA, 2018). By 2028, New Delhi is projected to become the most populous city in the world. In certain parts of Asia (e.g., some cities in Japan and the Republic of Korea), a steep decline in urban population is projected, mainly due to declining birth rates (Hori et al., 2020). Within Asia, rates of urban­­isation differ sub-regionally. Eastern Asia has seen the most rapid urban growth with the percentage of urban population having more than tripled from 18 to 60% between 1950 and 2015, while rates of urbanisation have decreased in West Asia and remained steady in Central Asia (UNDESA, 2018).Asian cities are seeing growing income inequality, with rural poverty being replaced by urban poverty (ADB, 2013). Regional studies show high and growing inequality within Indian and Chinese urban areas and decreasing rural–urban income gaps in Thailand and Vietnam (Baker and Gadgil, 2017; Imai and Malaeb, 2018). Critically, East Asia and the Asia–Pacific in general continue to house the world’s largest population of slum dwellers at 250 million, with most of them in China, Indonesia and the Philippines, and the highest rates of urban poverty in Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Indonesia and the Lao PDR (McIlreavy, 2015; Baker and Gadgil, 2017). A lot of urbanisation, especially in South Asia, is also ‘hidden’ due to poor, competing definitions of what is ‘urban’ and limited data (Ellis and Roberts, 2016).
