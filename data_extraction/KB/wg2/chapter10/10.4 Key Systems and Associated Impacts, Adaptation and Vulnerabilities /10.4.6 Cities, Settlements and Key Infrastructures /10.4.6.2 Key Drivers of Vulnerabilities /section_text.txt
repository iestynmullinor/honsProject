In Asian cities, climatic hazards such as changes in precipitation and, during the Asian monsoon, SLR, cyclones, flooding, dust storms, heatwaves and permafrost thawing (Byers et al., 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Rogelj et al., 2018; Shiklomanov, 2019), as well as non-climatic vulnerabilities such as non-climatic hazards (e.g., seismic hazards), inadequate infrastructure and services, unplanned urbanisation, socioeconomic inequalities and existing adaptation deficits (Johnson et al., 2013; Araos et al., 2016; de Leon and Pittock, 2017; Meerow, 2017; Dulal, 2019) interact to shape overall urban risk (Shaw et al., 2016a; Rumbach and Shirgaokar, 2017; Dodman et al., 2019). Caught at the intersection of high exposure, socioeconomic vulnerability and low adaptive capacities, informal settlements in urban and peri-urban areas are particularly at risk (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Meerow, 2017; Rumbach and Shirgaokar, 2017; Byers et al., 2018).
