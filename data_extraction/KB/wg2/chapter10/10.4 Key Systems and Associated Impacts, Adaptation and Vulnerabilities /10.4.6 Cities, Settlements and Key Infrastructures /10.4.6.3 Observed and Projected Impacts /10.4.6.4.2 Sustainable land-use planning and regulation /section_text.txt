Land use in cities impacts resource use (e.g., water, energy), risk (a function of population density, service provision and hazard exposure) and adaptive capacity, all of which influence the efficacy of urban adaptation (de Coninck et al., 2018). Locally suited land-use planning and regulation (such as appropriate zoning or building codes and safeguarding land rights) can have adaptation co-benefits (Mitchell et al., 2015; Dhar and Khirfan, 2016): for example, strict building regulations can protect urban wetlands and associated ecosystem services (Jiang et al., 2015); appropriate land zoning can safeguard green spaces, ensure improvements in permeability and obviate new development in risk-prone locations (Duy et al., 2019); and ensuring tenurial security or regularising informal settlements can incentivise improvements to housing quality, thereby alleviating vulnerability of the most marginal people (Mitchell et al., 2015).Land tenure arrangements strongly shape urban dwellers’ vulnerability and their adaptive capacities (Roy et al., 2013; Michael et al., 2018). For example, in Khulna (Bangladesh), Roy et al. (2013) found significant differences between the adaptive strategies of homeowners and renters in low-income settlements, a finding echoed in Bangalore (India) (Deshpande et al., 2018) and Phnom Penh (Cambodia) (Mitchell et al., 2015). In Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), land-based adaptation strategies include land zoning to control population and building density, demarcating environmental protection zones, and sub-urbanisation (Nahiduzzaman et al., 2015; Rahman et al., 2016). In many Asian cities, land subsidence control can serve as an adaptation strategy since it is estimated to significantly reduce relative SLR (high confidence). This has an important implication in that subsidence control would be a good and complementary measure to climate mitigation and climate adaptation in many coastal urban settings in Asia (Cao et al., 2021; Nicholls et al., 2021). Urban land-use planning, if used proactively, can incentivise adaptation–mitigation synergies and obviate unintended negative consequences of urbanisation as Xu et al. (2019) have shown in Xiamen.
