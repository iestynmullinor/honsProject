Over one-third of Asian cities and about 932 million urban dwellers live in areas with high risk of flooding (Gu et al., 2015). Of 437 cities at low risk of flood exposure but highly vulnerable to flood-related economic losses, approximately half are in Asia (Gu et al., 2015).Globally, China and India have the highest AALs associated with riverine floods, with a magnitude of 13 and 6 billion USD, respectively. Other countries from Asia among the top ten of absolute AALs are Japan, Bangladesh and Thailand. There is an increased flood risk for habitations on the deltas influenced by both riverine and coastal drivers of flooding (Szabo et al., 2016a), globally exposing 9.3% more people annually to riverine flooding than otherwise estimated without the compounded influence (Eilander et al., 2020). Simultaneously, SLR and subsidence are also expected to increase the risk due to frequent flood events for these delta regions than the longer-return periods otherwise associated with SLR (Yin et al., 2020).
