Of the multi-hazard global average annual loss (AAL)4  of 293 billion USD, 170 billion USD (58%) is in the Asia Pacific region (UNISDR, 2017). Of the top ten highest AALs associated with multi-hazards, six are in Asia (Japan, China, Republic of Korea, India, the Philippines and Taiwan, Province of China) (UNISDR, 2017). As per Gu et al. (2015), 56% of cities with populations greater than 300,000 in 2014 are exposed to at least one of the six physical hazards (cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides and volcanic eruptions). Cities in areas highly exposed and vulnerable to multiple hazards were also the ones that grew rapidly in population between 1950 and 2014, implying greater infrastructural investments in climate-sensitive areas. Among 27 cities highly exposed to multiple disasters, 13 cities had a population of 1 million or more in 2014. Among them were three megacities, Tokyo (Japan), Osaka (Japan) and Manila (the Philippines), with more than 10 million inhabitants exposed to three or more hazards. Seven other cities with 1 million inhabitants or more in Asia were at high risk of three or more types of disaster. Manila is highly vulnerable to economic losses and disaster-related mortality from all six types of disasters. Moscow (Russia) is the only megacity not exposed to the risk of any of the six types of physical hazards analysed (cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides and volcano eruptions). Of the eight megacities most vulnerable to disaster-related mortality, seven–Tokyo, Osaka, Karachi, Kolkata, Manila, Tianjin and Jakarta, totalling 143 million people–are in Asia (Gu et al., 2015).
