Understanding the motivations and processes underpinning decisions to adapt or not is key to enabling adaptation (see Section 17.2.2.1; Clayton et al., 2015; de Coninck et al., 2018; Taylor, 2019; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019a; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019b), because how and why certain people adapt is shaped by sociocultural factors, ways of making sense of risks and uncertainty, and personal motivations to undertake action (Nguyen et al., 2016; Mortreux and Barnett, 2017; Singh et al., 2018b; van Valkengoed and Steg, 2019b). The IPCC’s Assessment Report 5 was critiqued for silences on how perceptions shape climate action and the behavioural drivers of adaptation responses (Lorenzoni and Whitmarsh, 2014). Addressing this gap and assessing the growing literature from social sciences, notably psychology, behavioural economics and risk perception studies, the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C (de Coninck et al., 2018) comprehensively assessed behavioural dimensions of CCA for the first time; however, compared with studies on mitigation behaviour, the literature on what motivates adaptation remains incomplete (Lorenzoni and Whitmarsh, 2014; Clayton et al., 2015).
