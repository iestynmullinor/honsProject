Overall, understanding behavioural factors shaping adaptation implementation and uptake is important (medium evidence, high agreement ). While there is a growing literature on behavioural drivers of adaptation at the individual and household levels, gaps remain in understanding how socio-cognitive factors affect adaptation behaviour at higher scales (e.g., at local or subnational government, in the private sector, etc.)13. 12 More empirical evidence is needed in sectors beyond agriculture and disaster risk management (e.g., factors motivating urban adaptation) and better coverage across Asiaâ€™s sub-regions. Importantly, there are no studies on the behavioural aspects of adaptation from Central Asia.
