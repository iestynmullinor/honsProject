Changes in current lifestyles and consumption patterns are acknowledged as critical to climate action (de Coninck et al., 2018; IGES, 2019). With rapidly changing diets and increasing purchasing power, lifestyle changes in countries across Asia, especially those with large populations such as China and India, will be critical to contributing to global climate solutions (IGES, 2019). Lifestyle shifts that can contribute towards adaptation include:Engaging in urban agriculture through rooftop gardening, community gardens in urban and peri-urban areas and so forth (with implications for food-associated footprints but also nutritional, livelihood and well-being benefits) (Mohanty et al., 2012; Ackerman et al., 2014; Padgham and Dietrich, 2015)Shifts towards organic farming and creating demand for organically sourced food and other materialsShifts towards water-saving behaviour such as rainwater harvesting, water conservation, reducing water usage and so forth
