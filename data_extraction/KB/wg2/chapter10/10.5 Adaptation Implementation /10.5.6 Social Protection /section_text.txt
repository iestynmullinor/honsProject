Government SP can attenuate the negative impacts in facing disasters, depending on the differences in political systems and the focus put on sociopolitical measures (medium evidence, medium agreement ), not only in restoring livelihoods but also in easing mental burdens faced by rural households in developing countries (Dalton et al., 2016; Kosec and Mo, 2017; Liebenehm, 2018). However, limited government capacities and fiscal feasibility may impede the expansion and effective implementation of SP as developing countries need further support to design, adjust and implement SP schemes effectively (Klonner, 2014; Schwan and Yu, 2017). Most countries have comprehensive strategies for both SP and climate change, but few have attempted to align them, as in practice they remain in separate institutional homes, governed by their own intra-sector coordination groups and funding channels (Steinbach et al., 2016; Bank, 2018b). Thus, significant knowledge gaps remain in terms of understanding the potential of SP to build long-term resilience to climate change (Ulrichs et al., 2019). Future efforts should be geared to develop climate-responsive SP policies that consider a broad range of issues including urbanisation and migration, the impact of green policies on the poor, access to essential health care and risks to socially marginalised groups (Aleksandrova, 2019). Along with strengthening links to climate information and EWS, finance for enabling SP systems to address climate-related shocks and stresses dynamically needs to be scaled up (Kuriakose et al., 2013; Ulrichs et al., 2019).
