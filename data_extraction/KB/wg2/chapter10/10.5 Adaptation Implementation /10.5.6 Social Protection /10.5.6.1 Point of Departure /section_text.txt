Social protection (SP) encompasses initiatives that involve transfer income or assets to the poor, protect the vulnerable against risks to their livelihood, and enhance the social status and rights of the marginalised (Béné et al., 2014; Kothari, 2014). Social protection offers a wide range of instruments (e.g., cash transfers, insurance products, pension schemes and employment guarantee schemes) that can be used to support households that are exposed to climate changes (Bank, 2015). It also presents an opportunity to develop inclusive comprehensive risk management strategies to address L&D from climate change as well as a means to CCA (Aleksandrova, 2019).Social protection programmes assist individuals and families, especially the poor and vulnerable, cope with crises and shocks, finds jobs, improve productivity, invest in the health and education of their children, and protect the ageing population (Bank, 2018b). Social protection that is well designed and implemented in a more long-term approach can enhance human capital and productivity, reduce inequalities, build resilience and empowerment, and end the inter-generational cycle of poverty (medium evidence, medium agreement ) as indicated from various experiences in the region such as (a) cash transfer programmes in Indonesia (Kwon and Kim, 2015), (b) the Benazir Income Support Programme in Pakistan (Watson et al., 2017), (c) the Chars Livelihoods Programme in Bangladesh (Pritchard et al., 2015) and (d) Minsei-in designated volunteer social workers in Japan (Boeckmann, 2016). A key consideration in strengthening resilience through SP programmes is to design with climate and disaster risk considerations in mind and implement in close synergy with existing programmes, such as on sustainable livelihoods, EWS and financial inclusion (Coirolo et al., 2013; Bank, 2018a).
