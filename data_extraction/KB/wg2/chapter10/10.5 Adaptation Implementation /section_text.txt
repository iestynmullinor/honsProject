Capacity building at national and local levels still needs to address gaps in research and practice, such as impacts and results of different preparedness measures (Alcayna et al., 2016). Ad-hoc and localised documentations and monitoring of efforts to build adaptive capacities has rendered it difficult to assess success (Cinner et al., 2018). Recommendations for strengthened capacity building are sometimes made or understood in isolation from the underlying structural issues shaping vulnerability, or without adequately recognising the political relationships that mediate the ways in which particular technical interventions result in differentiated outcomes for different groups (Archer and Dodman, 2015). Thus, design- and decision-based tools, such as rapid assessment for community resilience to climate change as well as rapid approach to monitor the effectiveness of aid projects, support the community-based adaptation to climate change to analyse using a multi-dimensional approach, procedural, distributional, rights and responsibilities (Nkoana et al., 2018; Jacobson et al., 2019).As a model of communication and engagement, citizen science has the potential to promote individual and collective climate-change action (Groulx et al., 2017). More than information provision is needed to mobilise public action on climate change (Kyburz-Graber, 2013). Citizen science links communication and engagement in a manner that holds important lessons on ways to promote collective responses to climate (Wals et al., 2014; Bonney et al., 2016). The power of science-based citizen engagement lies in citizen group contribution in drawing upon their local knowledge to enrich the knowledge base required for management decisions (Sayer et al., 2015). Scientific evidence may be less attuned to the complexity of local realities in managing climate change; thus, citizen science has the potential in bridging this gap and has many advantages for climate mitigation and adaptation practice and policy (Ford et al., 2016). While citizen science uses citizens as policy-passive objects for research in conducting measurements for big datasets, citizen social science is gaining momentum where it repositions citizens as central co-learners who can widen the climate-science evidence base to achieve a more holistic understanding for the benefit of all (Kythreotis et al., 2019).
