The need to develop tailored climate communication and education strategies for individual nations as public awareness and risk perceptions towards climate change vary greatly (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Lee et al., 2015a). Improving on, and investing in, basic education, climate literacy and location-based strategies of climate change are vital to enhance public engagement, societies’ adaptive capacity and support for climate action (Lutz et al., 2014c; Hu and Chen, 2016). As stated in the IPCC Special Report 1.5°C, sustainable development has the potential to significantly reduce systemic vulnerability, enhance adaptive capacity and promote livelihood security for poor and disadvantaged populations (Roy et al., 2018). Hence, various concepts are introduced to foster awareness, understanding, knowledge, participation as well as commitment towards managing climate change in a sustainable manner. One such concept is education for sustainable development (ESD), which is aimed at integrating the principles and practices of sustainable development in all aspects of education, and training individuals who will contribute to the realisation of a more sustainable society (Kitamura, 2017).Climate-change education (CCE) is also now addressed in the context of ESD and allows for learners to understand the causes and consequences of climate change, and teaches them how to take action (Mochizuki and Bryan, 2015). Both ESD and CCE are gaining broader attention, for instance, in China (Han, 2015) and the Republic of Korea (Sung, 2015); however, development of policies and implementation of initiatives regarding ESD and CCE still face a handful of challenges which require a strong political will and consensus of key stakeholders (Læssøe and Mochizuki, 2015). Effective communication on CCE particularly for younger-generation engagement is also essential, as they are our future leaders as climate change is an inter-generational equity issue (Corner et al., 2015). Action for Climate Empowerment of Article 6 of the UNFCCC target youth as a major group for effective engagement in the formulation and implementation of decisions on climate change (UNFCCC, 2015). Increasing attention from countries in Asia, such as Thailand and India, will encourage innovative ways to provide adequately in educating and engaging youth in climate-change issues (Narksompong and Limjirakan, 2015; Dür and Keller, 2018).An integrated approach to knowledge about climate change embraces both the importance in bridging knowledge of climate science and respecting IKLK, and should be at the heart of any effort to educate citizens to have a deeper understanding of the causes and consequence of climate change in a holistic manner (Aswani et al., 2018). Indigenous Peoples, comprising about 6% of the global population, play a crucial role in the fight against climate change for two interlinked reasons. First, they have a particular physical and spiritual relationship with land, water and associated ecosystems, and tend to be among the most vulnerable group to climate change (Magni, 2017). Second, they have a specialised ecological and traditional knowledge relevant to finding the best solutions to climate change (Rautela and Karki, 2015). Indigenous knowledge systems and resource management practices are important tools for both mitigating and adapting to climate change (Fernandez-Llamazares et al., 2015). Indigenous knowledge is increasingly recognised as a powerful tool for compiling evidence of climate change over time (Ahmed et al., 2016a). Knowledge of CCA and DRR provide a range of complementary approaches in building resilience and reducing the vulnerability of natural and human systems to the impacts of climate change and environmental hazards (Mall et al., 2019). The adaptation dimension involves developing knowledge and utilising existing IKLK, skills and dispositions to better cope with already evident and looming climate impacts (Aghaei et al., 2018). It is also important to ensure inclusive efforts in DRR across different nations and communities as well as increasing skills and capacities of women towards DRR efforts (Alam and Rahman, 2014; Drolet et al., 2015; Islam et al., 2016b; Reyes and Lu, 2016; Hemachandra et al., 2018). More effective and efficient teaching and learning strategies, as well as collaborative networks, are needed to increase preparedness and DRR activities across various levels of community (Oktari et al., 2015; Takahashi et al., 2015; Tuladhar et al., 2015b; Shiwaku et al., 2016; Gampell et al., 2017).Table 10.6 shows education and capacity-building aspects affecting adaptation by sub-region examples.Table 10.6 | Education and capacity-building aspects affecting adaptation by sub-regions examplesSub-regionSectorsAdaptation interventionsEducation and capacity-building factors affecting adaptationSupporting referencesNorth AsiaHuman well-beingPEEX (Pan Eurasian Experiment) originating from a bottom-up approach by the science communities aiming at resolving major uncertainties in Earth system science and global sustainability issues concerning the Arctic and boreal pan-Eurasian regions, as well as ChinaEducating the next generation of multidisciplinary experts and scientists capable of finding tools in solving future environmental, socioeconomic and demographic development problems of the Arctic and boreal regions, as well as ChinaPan Eurasian regions, as well as China (Kulmala et al., 2015)West AsiaAgricultureSmallholder farmers’ vulnerability assessmentHigh level of education, more human capacity and adaptive capacity, less vulnerabilityIran (Jamshidi et al., 2019)Central AsiaAgriculture, water resources and energyCarrying out the selection and cultivation of drought-tolerant, salt-tolerant crops, preservation of the upper watershed of the rivers, improving climate resilience of hydro-facilitiesPlacing the focal point for the preparation and implementation of programmes for climate change at the regional level, increasing capacity of professionals in targeted areas and networking between them, and strengthening institutional, technical and human resources to promote adaptation and research in fields of climate and hydrological investigations, geographic information systems, environmental impact assessment, and protection and re-cultivation of landsKazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan mountain societies in Central Asia (Schmidt-Vogt et al., 2016;
