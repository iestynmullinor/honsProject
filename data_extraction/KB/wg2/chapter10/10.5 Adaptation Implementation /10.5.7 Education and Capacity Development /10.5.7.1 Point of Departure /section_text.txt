Asian areas with the least capacity to respond, such as the Himalayan region and densely populated deltas, are hit first and hardest by climate impacts (De Souza et al., 2015; Khan, 2017). Acknowledging the limitations in terms of capacity and coping mechanisms towards climate change, education, training and awareness building is central to sustaining long-term capacity building (Clemens et al., 2016). Education has a lot more to offer in terms of improvements in addressing climate change, particularly in the climate hotspots of Asia where mostly poor, disadvantaged communities vulnerable to climate change reside (Mani et al., 2018). In particular, when disseminated, climate-change awareness and information need more explanation (Steg et al., 2014; Wi and Chang, 2018; Cho, 2020). In addition, international and national support through institutions and financing is critical for successful capacity building (Hemachandra, 2019), which must be designed for the long term and be self-sustaining (Gustafson et al., 2018). National ownership by recipient countries and members of communities of capacity-building efforts is key to ensuring their success (Roberts and Pelling, 2016; Mikulewicz, 2017).
