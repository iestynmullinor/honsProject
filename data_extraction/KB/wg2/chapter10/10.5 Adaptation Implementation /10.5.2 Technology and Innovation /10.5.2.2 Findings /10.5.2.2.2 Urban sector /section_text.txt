In the urban sector, a wide variety of sensor technologies are being used to monitor urban land-use and climate changes over time, and to better understand the potential impacts of future changes. These sensors range from large optical–thermal–radar satellite instruments with (near) global coverage–for example, Landsat (US Geological Service), Sentinel (European Space Agency), ALOS (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and MethaneSAT–to portable sensors embedded in mobile phones (e.g., phone cameras or temperature sensors) whose data are collected into centralised databases through crowdsourcing (Fenner et al., 2017; Meier et al., 2017). To combine and extract useful information from these heterogeneous sensor data–for example, for conducting climate risk assessments (Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Bechtel et al., 2019) and/or simulations of future land-use or climate changes in urban areas (Bateman et al., 2016; Iizuka et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017c)–AI technologies (e.g., machine-learning algorithms) are now being widely adopted (Johnson and Iizuka, 2016; Joshi et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2017). Thanks to advances in cloud-computing technology, which allows for online processing of massive volumes of remote sensing data, high-resolution (~30 m) global urban-area maps from the late 1990s to 2018 are now available from several different sources (Gong et al., 2020). Using these historical maps, researchers have been able to generate maps of future urban land-use changes at the global level to 2100 (Chen et al., 2020a), which can help to elucidate the potential impacts of this future urban expansion and identify adaptation needs. Technology also plays a major role in urban planning and design in the context of adaptation. To mitigate rising urban temperatures and reduce the impacts of climate-related hazards, many new ‘grey’ infrastructure and ‘green’ infrastructure technologies are being adopted in urban areas in Asia, for example, cool (i.e., high solar reflectance) rooftops and pavements as well as green (i.e., vegetated) rooftops to mitigate high temperatures; and porous pavements to mitigate flooding (Akbari and Kolokotsa, 2016).
