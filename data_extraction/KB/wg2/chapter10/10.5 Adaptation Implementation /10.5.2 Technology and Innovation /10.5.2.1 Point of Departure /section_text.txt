Much like any other field, CCA is greatly facilitated by science, technology and continuous innovation. These range from the application of existing science, to the development of new scientific tools and methods, to the utilisation of Indigenous knowledge and citizen science. Many of the pressing problems in Asia, including water scarcity, rapid urbanisation, loss of natural habitats, biodiversity, rising coastal and river basin hazards, and agricultural loss can be effectively minimised through the adoption of suitable scientific and technological methods. Despite the current challenges in the region, many significant advances in science and technology have been made, and the future prospects look bright. The following sections outline the present status and future prospects of science and technology in scaling up adaptation actions in four key sectors, namely (a) DRR, (b) urbanisation, (c) water and agriculture, and (d) forests and biodiversity.
