Climate-change governance is characterised by a scalar/stakeholder turn which includes: (a) acknowledgement of the importance of both subnational and transnationalâ€“regional scales along with the global scale; (b) involvement of diverse stakeholders in decision-making systems; (c) reliance on bottom-up architectures of governance that are supported by the framework given by the SDGs; (d) emphasis on developmental and environmental co-benefits; (e) recognition of diverse experiences of marginalisation and social stratification, and their impacts on participation in governance-related activities; and (f) greater decentralisation and strengthening of local institutions.
