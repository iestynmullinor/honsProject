Risk insurance approaches and tools have significantly evolved during recent years. The emphasis has been mainly on mitigating the adverse selection and moral hazard that have been the limitations of traditional area-based crop insurance approaches (He et al., 2019). This has been achieved by shifting the indemnity calculations on to the specific weather parameters and developing a weather index (Greatrex et al., 2015; Fischer, 2019). Technological applications in the development of insurance products have seen significant progress, including that of the blockchain and smart contracts (Gatteschi et al., 2018). There are technological developments in loss estimation, which has been a major limitation in the traditional insurance approaches in the past that either delayed the indemnity payment or misjudged the losses. Application of multi-model and multi-stage decision support systems has begun to make crop loss assessments for insurance more efficient (Aggarwal et al., 2020). Technological applications also include remote sensing (Di et al., 2017) and mobile phone app technologies (Meena et al., 2018) to provide accurate and quick damage assessments, and application of Internet-based indemnity approvals have enabled quick payment of indemnities (OECD, 2017b).
