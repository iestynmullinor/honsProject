Adaptation follows knowledge on risks, and literature exists that systematically identifies and characterises exposure and vulnerability, but gaps still exist. Decision making under uncertainty is challenged by the lack of data for adapting to current and uncertain future climate, the different perceptions of risk, and the potential solutions across different cultures and languages (van der Keur et al., 2016). Lack of downscaled climatic data, diverse institutional structures, and missing links in policies, are among the challenges in South Asia (Mall et al., 2019). In agriculture, there are gaps in the use of advanced farming techniques such as drought-resistant crops, and information on climate change to support farming households in making adaptation decisions (Akhtar et al., 2019; Khanal et al., 2019; Ullah et al., 2019). Better understanding of effective water management is crucial due to conflicts for shared water in ARA (Shaban and Hamze, 2017; UNDP, 2018). For delta regions, gaps identified are methodologies and approaches appropriate for understanding social vulnerability at various scales, pathways required for adaptation policy and response in the deltas that transcend development, and the lessons from implemented policy and how practice can build on these lessons in the deltas, among others (Lwasa, 2015). Approaches in tackling the challenges of climate change and disasters in the cities of developing countries could be better understood, and shared between cities so they can learn from one another (Filho et al., 2019).
