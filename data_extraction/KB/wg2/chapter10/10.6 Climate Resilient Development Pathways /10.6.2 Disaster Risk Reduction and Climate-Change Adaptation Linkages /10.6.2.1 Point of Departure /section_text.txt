There is growing evidence on the interconnectedness of extreme weather, climate change and disaster impacts (Asia, 2017; Reyer, 2017). In Asia, climate-related disasters have become more recurrent and destructive in terms of both economic and social impacts (Bhatt et al., 2015; Aich et al., 2017; Vij et al., 2017). Projections of increasing frequency, intensity and severity of climate-related disasters call for better integration of CCA and DRR (Sapountzaki, 2018) in policy development to address risks efficiently (Rahman et al., 2018) and to promote sustainable development pathways for reduced vulnerability and increased resilience (Seidler et al., 2018). Connecting CCA and DRR efforts in both policy and practice continue to be a challenge, however, because the convergence of national policy and planning processes on CCA and DRR within Asia is in its early stages (Cousins, 2014) and structural barriers persist (Mall et al., 2019). Both CCA and DRR have developed as separate policy domains because of the different temporal and spatial scales considered, the diversity of actors involved, the policies and institutional frameworks adopted and the differences in tools and methodological approaches used. This has resulted in the CCA and DRR communities, and the knowledge and research they produce to support planning and decision making, not always being well connected (Street et al., 2019).
