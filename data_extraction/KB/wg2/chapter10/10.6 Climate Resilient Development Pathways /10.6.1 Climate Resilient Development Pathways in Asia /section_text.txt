Climate resilient development pathways (CRDPs) are ‘trajectories that strengthen sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while promoting fair and cross-scalar adaptation to and resilience in a changing climate’ (Roy et al., 2018). Moving beyond a business-as-usual scenario, CRDPs involve not only adaptation and mitigation choices but also sustainable development implications and societal transformation (Roy et al., 2018). This basic understanding of CRDPs explicitly reflects that climate action (mitigation and adaptation) and sustainable development are fundamentally integrated and interdependent.There is high confidence that currently implemented climate action in Asia (such as climate-smart agriculture, ecosystem-based DRR and investing in urban blue–green infrastructure) can meet adaptation, mitigation and SDGs simultaneously, presenting opportunities for climate resilient development (CRD). However, there also exist significant barriers to CRD such as fragmented, reactive governance; inadequate evidence on which actions to prioritise and how to sequence them; and finance deficits. Some Asian countries and regions offer solutions to overcome these barriers: through use of advanced technologies (in situ observation and remote sensing, a variety of new sensor technologies, citizen science, AI and machine learning tools); regional partnerships and learning; improved forecasting capabilities; and better risk awareness (high confidence).Asian countries are repeatedly identified as the most vulnerable to climatic risks with key sectors such as agriculture, cities and infrastructure, and terrestrial ecosystems expected to see high exposure to multiple hazards (Section 10.3). Owing to rapid development and large populations, Asian countries have large and growing GHG emissions: in 2018, five of the top ten emitters in the world were Asian–China (1), India (3), Japan (5), the Republic of Korea (8) and Indonesia (10) (Friedlingstein et al., 2019)–although it is critical to note that per-capita emissions and cumulative emissions are relatively lower than in developed economies (Raupach et al., 2014). However, in the 2020 Sustainability Index and Dashboard, only two Asian countries made it into the top 30 countries in the world: Japan (17) and the Republic of Korea (20) (Sachs et al., 2020). Finally, Asia has varied capacities to adapt with high heterogeneity in adaptation progress across the region.Given this context of high risks, growing emissions and varied adaptive capacities in Asia, CRDPs can enable (a) reducing existing vulnerability and inequality, (b) sustainable development and meeting the SDGs and (c) managing multiple and often concurrent risks, including climate-change and disaster risks. Potentially, combinations of adaptation and mitigation options will be required to lead to CRD (see Figure 18.1 on CRDPs ), and some of them are shown in Table 10.7. For example, climate-smart agriculture strengthens food security (SDG 2, Zero Hunger) (Aggarwal et al., 2019); urban disaster management, such as the Jakarta Disaster Risk Reduction Education Initiative, contributes to SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities) (Ajibade et al., 2019).Table 10.7 | Adaptation options that can have mitigation and SDG synergies and trade-offs, providing opportunities for the triple wins necessary for climate resilient development pathwaysAdaptation optionMitigation impacts (H/M/L/NA)aImplications on SDGsReferencesPositiveNegativeWetland protection, restorationMedium synergyCarbon sequestration through mangrovesSDGs 8, 14, 15Southeast Asia: Griscom et al.

Other specific agricultural practices that have adaptation and mitigation synergies include between-tillage and residue management, alternate wetting and drying, site-specific nutrient management, crop diversification for less-water-intensive crops, such as maize, and improved livestock management (Aryal et al., 2020a).(c) Risk management strategies in agriculture include crop insurance, index insurance, social networking and community-based adaptation, collective international action and integrated agro-meteorological advisory services (Aryal et al., 2020b).The following subsections examine CRDPs through three approaches that are particularly important in Asia and have a large body of evidence to assess implications for adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development. The three illustrative approaches are: (a) disaster risk management and adaptation synergies, (b) the food–water–energy nexus and (c) poverty alleviation and meeting equity goals.
