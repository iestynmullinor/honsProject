The food–water–energy nexus can be evaluated in the two-way interactions between water–food, water–energy and food–energy (Taniguchi et al., 2017a). The water–energy nexus includes water for energy and energy for water (Rothausen and Conway, 2011; Hussey and Pittock, 2012; Byers et al., 2014), the water–food nexus includes water for food and the impact of food production on water (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012) and the energy–food nexus includes energy consumption for food production and food crops for biofuel production (Tilman et al., 2009). The food–water–energy–land nexus has diverse implications at the sub-regional level in Asia. The increase in the water-supply gap raises questions about the sustainability of the main mode of electricity generation in South Asia. Thermal power generation and hydropower generation are both threatened by water shortages in South Asia (Luo, 2018b; Mitra et al., 2021). Furthermore, policy-mismatch-driven anthropogenic causes lead to unsustainable water use for food production in India. For example, subsidised electricity supply for watering agriculture plays a key role in losing groundwater’s buffer capacity against the various changes including climate variabilities (Badiani et al., 2012; Mitra, 2017). In the Mekong River basin of Southeast Asia, massive and rapid export-oriented hydropower development will have direct implications on regional food security and livelihoods through a major negative effect on the aquatic ecosystem (Baran and Myschowoda, 2009; Dugan et al., 2010; Arias et al., 2014). Similarly, in Central Asia, the shifting of water storage for irrigation to power development has increased risks on reliable water supply and quality of water (Granit et al., 2012). Deforestation-driven agro-environmental changes have led to a decreased forest water supply, an increased irrigation water demand and a negative effect on cropland stability and productivity (Lim et al., 2017a; Lim et al., 2019b).
