Food, energy, water and land are vital elements for sustainable development as well as enhancing resilience to both climatic and non-climatic shocks. All these resources are highly vulnerable to climate change (Sections 10.3.1, 10.3.4). Poor people are most affected due to changes in resources availability and accessibility. Food, water and energy security are interconnected (Bizikova et al., 2013; Ringler et al., 2013; Rasul, 2014; Chang et al., 2016; Ringler et al., 2016). Although adapting to climate change is one of the core components of the global, regional, national and subnational agendas, the focus of adaptation action has remained sectoral. Undermining the interlinkages of food, energy and water security may increase trade-offs between sectors or places, which may lead to maladaptation (Barnett and O’Neill, 2010; Howells et al., 2013; Lele et al., 2013). Therefore, focusing on the nature of trade-offs and synergies across the food–water–energy nexus for integrated management of resources is a potential strategy for adaptation to both climatic and non-climatic challenges (Bhaduri et al., 2015; Zaman et al., 2017). Due to its importance to the Paris Agreement and SDGs, the food–water–energy nexus approach has gotten increasing attention in terms of capturing synergies and minimising trade-offs in this interconnected system, which is also critical for enhancing adaptation together (Bazilian et al., 2011; Lawford et al., 2013; UNESCAP, 2013; FAO, 2014; Rasul and Sharma, 2014; Taniguchi et al., 2017a; Sukhwani et al., 2019; Sukhwani et al., 2020).
