Many challenges remain in both scientific research and policy actions at the global, regional, national and subnational levels. The scientific challenges include data, information and knowledge gaps in understanding the food, energy, water and land interlinkages, and lack of systematic tools to address trade-offs (Liu et al., 2017a). Until very recently, implementation of the food–energy–water nexus focused primarily on technical solutions, whereas governance (i.e., the institutions and processes governing the food–energy–water nexus) has not received much consideration (Scheyvens and Shivakoti, 2019). At the policy end, the common challenges for implementation of the water–energy–food–land nexus are absence of sectoral coordination (Pahl-Wostl, 2019), the influence of political priorities on decisions and lack of processes for scientific knowledge to shape decisions, lack of capacity to understand interlinkages between sectors, lack of multi-stakeholder engagement in planning and decision-making processes, and lack of incentive mechanisms and adequate finance to support the approach (Bao et al., 2018; Scheyvens and Shivakoti, 2019).
