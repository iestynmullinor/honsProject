Limited evidence about climate impacts exists for valuable non-food aquatic materials. Ocean warming and acidification harm red coral (Corallium rubrum) (Bramanti et al., 2013) and communities hosting black coral (Antipatharian spp.), both used for jewellery (Ross et al., 2020). While no-take MPAs (Section 3.6.3.2) enhance red-coral structural complexity, they only weakly compensate for warming effects (Cerrano et al., 2013; Montero-Serra et al., 2019). Antipatharian spp. are not well studied or monitored (Gress and Andradi-Brown, 2018). Acidification and warming negatively impact pearl oysters (Welladsen et al., 2010; Liu and He, 2012; Liu et al., 2012; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2019b). For example, projected climate impacts for 2035 would decrease the average net present value of French Polynesia’s pearl aquaculture industry by 29.1% compared with the present (Hilsenroth et al., 2021). Climate impacts on ornamental species sought by aquarists have not been well studied (Dee et al., 2019b).Decreasing the vulnerability of renewable-energy installations, particularly wind turbines, to climate risks (Table 3.26; Bindoff et al., 2019a) could include technological adaptations (Section 3.6.2.2) such as storm ‘survival mode’ settings (Penalba et al., 2018); preparation for hazards such as icing, SLR, drifting sea ice and wave activity (Neill et al., 2018; Goodale and Milman, 2019; Solaun and Cerdá, 2019); and biofouling (medium confidence) (Want and Porter, 2018; Joyce et al., 2019; Vinagre et al., 2020), which is expected  to increase in response to warming and acidification (medium confidence) (Dobretsov et al., 2019; Khosravi et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020d; Lamim and Procópio, 2021). Macroalgae and fish-processing byproducts are being tested for biofuel use (Greene et al., 2016; Alamsjah et al., 2017; Saifuddin and Boyce, 2017; Sakthivel et al., 2018; Sudhakar et al., 2019; Nguyen et al., 2020; Ramachandra and Hebbale, 2020; Tan et al., 2020), but weather variability could pose financial risk to this sector (Kleiman et al., 2021).
