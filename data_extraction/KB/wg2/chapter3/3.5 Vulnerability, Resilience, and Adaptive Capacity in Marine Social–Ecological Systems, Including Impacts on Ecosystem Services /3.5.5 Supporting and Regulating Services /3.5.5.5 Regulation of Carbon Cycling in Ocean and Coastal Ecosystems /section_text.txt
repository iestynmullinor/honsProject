Current and future total carbon storage and cycling in the ocean are governed by past and future CO2 emissions trajectories (Table 3.26), but regional ocean and coastal carbon stocks and cycling vary over time and space due to processes being altered by climate, including ocean circulation, sea ice cover, coastal upwelling and thermal stratification (Section 3.2.2.3); ocean primary production and export (Sections 3.2.3, 3.4.4); and marine ecosystem biodiversity (high confidence) (Section 3.5.2; Figure 3.22). Quantifying regional carbon fluxes and stocks is still challenging and relies on indirect measures (e.g., Fennel et al., 2019; Clay et al., 2020), especially in coastal ecosystems where drivers interact. Carbon cycling and storage co-occurs with other regulating services such as habitat provision, water-quality maintenance and coastal protection (Ouyang et al., 2018), particularly in vegetated coastal ecosystems (see Box 3.4). Adaptations to support regional carbon cycling and storage generally focus on area-based management and conservation (Section 3.6.3.2), but interventions to enhance ocean carbon storage are being explored for mitigation (WGIII AR6 Chapter 7).
