Coastal ecosystems physically protect people and property from storms and flooding, and climate change threatens this protection function (Figure 3.22; Table 3.26). Increasingly detailed models show how warm-water coral reefs (Reguero et al., 2019; Storlazzi et al., 2019; Reguero et al., 2021) mangroves (Blankespoor et al., 2017; Menéndez et al., 2020; Trégarot et al., 2021) and wetlands (Sun and Carson, 2020) prevent billions of US dollars of direct and indirect damage to private and public property and shield millions of people from flooding each year. Protection by mangroves provides more economic benefits in higher-income nations and shields more people in lower-income nations (Menéndez et al., 2020). Seagrasses (James et al., 2020; James et al., 2021), kelp (Morris et al., 2020b; Zhu, 2020), suspended shellfish aquaculture (Gentry et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020a), oyster reefs (Chowdhury et al., 2019), coastal wetlands (Möller, 2019; Keimer et al., 2021) and sandy coastlines (Section 3.4.2.6) Hérivaux et al., 2018) also measurably decrease wave energy. Non-climate drivers [e.g., invasive species (James et al., 2020), sediment-supply changes (Ganju, 2019; Ladd et al., 2019; Ilia, 2020), erosion and storm damage (Mehvar et al., 2019; Bacopoulos and Clark, 2021)], acting together with climate-induced drivers and associated impacts [e.g., SLR (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3), changes in plant biodiversity (Section 3.5.2; Lee Smee, 2019; Silliman et al., 2019; Schoutens et al., 2020), MHWs (Section 3.4.3.7) and acidification (Section 3.4.2.1)], compromise physical protection by coastal ecosystems (very high confidence). (See Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3 and Sections 3.6.3.1 and 3.6.3.2.2 for assessment of adaptations that address this ecosystem service.)
