Climate regulation by the ocean depends on physical and biogeochemical processes (Sections 3.2â€“3.4) that create, move, and store heat, water vapour and other climate-active compounds including CO2, methane and dimethyl sulphide (WGI AR6 Chapter 6; Szopa et al., 2021). Over the 21st century, ocean heat and CO2 uptake will continue (WGI AR6 SPMB4.1, B5.1; IPCC, 2021b) and sea ice loss from warming will allow some additional CO2 uptake (Armstrong et al., 2019), but the ocean will take up a smaller fraction of CO2 emissions as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise (high confidence) (Table 3.26; WGI AR6 SPM B4.1; IPCC, 2021b).There is very limited evidence on climate-driven air-quality changes in the coastal zone. Increased humidity decreases the lifetime of ozone and increases particulate matter and indoor mould levels (USGCRP, 2016), potentially affecting near-shore air quality. However, coastal-zone air pollution can enhance coastal-climate impacts by increasing the risk of acid rain, which worsens ocean acidification (nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and mercury; Doney, 2010; Northcott et al., 2019).
