Climate impacts have already altered ocean and coastal habitats (Section 3.4.2; Table 3.26; Gissi et al., 2021) in ways that have led to species range shifts, biodiversity changes, phenology changes and regime shifts (Section 3.4.3) from the surface ocean to the seafloor (very high confidence) (see Box 3.3; Figure 3.22). Continued ocean and coastal habitat impacts are projected, and their severities will depend on emissions scenario and co-occurring drivers (Section 3.4.3; Qiu et al., 2019) or extremes (e.g., Babcock et al., 2019). Warming and physical circulation are projected to change larval dispersal, a habitat-related service (Bashevkin et al., 2020), but identifying probable outcomes remains challenging owing to the high variability among species, locations and recruitment (Schilling et al., 2020; King et al., 2021; Le Corre et al., 2021; Raventos et al., 2021). Climate risks to habitat can be decreased by reducing non-climate drivers, preserving ecosystems or restoring habitat (Sections 3.6.2, 3.6.3.2). Risk to larval dispersal cannot be meaningfully addressed at scale by human-implemented adaptations; instead, declines in this service will pressure natural systems to adapt via physiological plasticity or evolution (Section 3.3; Bashevkin et al., 2020).Figure 3.22 | Observed global influence of climate-induced drivers on ecosystem services.  Symbols show whether the observed impact of the climate-induced drivers on a group of ecosystem services is positive (beneficial), negative (detrimental) or mixed (usually resulting from location, the presence of interacting drivers or changing effects over time). The ‘observed impact’ indicates the total effect of all climate-induced drivers on a specific ecosystem service, using expert judgement based on summary statements throughout Section 3.5. Tick marks represent the presence of co-occurring drivers non-climate drivers that affect the service. No assessment indicates that not enough evidence is available to assess the direction of impact.Open figure
