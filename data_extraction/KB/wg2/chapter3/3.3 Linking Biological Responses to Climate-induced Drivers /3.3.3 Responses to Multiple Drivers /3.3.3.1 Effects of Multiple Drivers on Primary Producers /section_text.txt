Warming and rising CO2 concentrations enhance growth and/or photosynthetic rates in many species of cyanobacteria, picoeukaryotes, coccolithophores, dinoflagellates and diatoms (high confidence) (Fu et al., 2007; Sett et al., 2014; Hoppe et al., 2018a; Wolf et al., 2018; Brandenburg et al., 2019), and the optimum pCO2 for growth and/or primary production shifts upward under warming (medium confidence) (Sett et al., 2014; Hoppe et al., 2018a). Warming and ocean acidification appear to jointly favour the proliferation and toxicity of harmful algal bloom (HAB) species (limited evidence, high agreement ) (Section 3.5.5.3; Bindoff et al., 2019a; Brandenburg et al., 2019; Griffith et al., 2019a; Wells et al., 2020), but a 2021 analysis found no uniform global trend in HABs or their distribution over 1985–2018 once field data were adjusted for regional variations in monitoring effort (Hallegraeff et al., 2021). The predominantly detrimental impacts of ocean acidification on coccolithophores can partly be offset by warming (Seifert et al., 2020) but also be exacerbated, depending on the magnitudes of drivers (D’Amario et al., 2020). For non-calcifying macroalgae, responses are highly species specific and often indicate synergistic interactions between warming and acidification (Kram et al., 2016; Falkenberg et al., 2018). Ocean acidification poses a large risk for coralline algae that is further amplified by warming (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.2.2; Cornwall et al., 2019). However, temperatures up to 5°C above ambient do not decrease calcification (Cornwall et al., 2019), and there is limited evidence that some species have the physiological capacity to resist acidification via pH upregulation at the calcification site (Cornwall et al., 2017a). For seagrass, warming beyond a species’ thermal tolerance will limit growth and impact germination, but ocean acidification appears to increase thermal tolerance of some eelgrass species by increasing the photosynthesis-to-respiration ratio (medium confidence) (Egea et al., 2018; Scalpone et al., 2020; Zimmerman, 2021).Thermal sensitivity of pelagic primary producers changes with nutrient supply (high confidence) (Thomas et al., 2017; Marañón et al., 2018; Fernández et al., 2020). Phosphorus limitation lowers the temperature optimum for growth of phytoplankton, making these organisms more prone to heat stress (Thomas et al., 2017; Bestion et al., 2018). This trend may hold for open-ocean phytoplankton, which are often iron-limited (medium confidence) (Boyd, 2019). Such temperature-nutrient interactions might be especially relevant during summer MHWs (Section 3.2.2.1; Cross-Chapter Box EXTREMES in Chapter 2; IPCC, 2018; Holbrook et al., 2019; DeCarlo et al., 2020; Hayashida et al., 2020), when primary producers are often nutrient-limited and near their thermal limits. Increasingly frequent and intense MHWs along with projected decreases in nutrient availability (Section 3.2.3.3) may push some primary producers beyond tolerance thresholds. Temperature–nutrient interactions can also alter the photosynthesis-to-respiration ratio in phytoplankton (Marañón et al., 2018). Overall, rising metabolic rates due to warming will be restricted to primary producers in high-nutrient regions (medium confidence) (Thomas et al., 2017; Marañón et al., 2018). For zooxanthellae-containing corals, nutrient supply from upwelling or from runoff can increase coral susceptibility to bleaching during warm-season MHWs (DeCarlo et al., 2020; Wooldridge, 2020).The effects of ocean acidification on growth, metabolic rates or elemental composition of primary producers changes with nutrient availability and light conditions (high confidence) (Gao et al., 2019; Seifert et al., 2020). While interactions with nutrients are often additive in phytoplankton, diatoms revealed predominantly synergistic interactions (Seifert et al., 2020). Growth or photosynthesis of some diatom and HAB species, for instance, are stimulated by ocean acidification only if nutrients are replete (Hoppe et al., 2013; Boyd et al., 2015b; Eberlein et al., 2016; Griffith et al., 2019a). Interactions with light are more complex because relative effects of ocean acidification are larger under limiting irradiances, while saturating light levels decrease beneficial or detrimental effects on these processes (Kranz et al., 2010; Garcia et al., 2011; Rokitta and Rost, 2012; Heiden et al., 2016). For the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, for example, the impacts of ocean acidification are less detrimental under high light availability, which could partly explain why this species is moving poleward (Winter et al., 2014; Kondrik et al., 2017; Neukermans et al., 2018), although acidification is more pronounced in polar waters (Section 3.2.3.1; Cross-Chapter Paper 6). Under excess light, however, the detrimental impacts of ocean acidification are amplified for many species (high confidence) (Gao et al., 2012; Li and Campbell, 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Kottmeier et al., 2016; Gafar et al., 2019). Lowered photo-physiological capacity to cope with high-light stress and avoid photodamage (Gao et al., 2012; Li and Campbell, 2013; Hoppe et al., 2015; Kvernvik et al., 2020) is also consistent with observations that dynamic light regimes can become more stressful under ocean acidification (Jin et al., 2013; Hoppe et al., 2015). Given the expected mixed-layer shallowing in some regions (Section 3.2.2.3), the exposure to overall higher mean irradiances could shift the effects of acidification from beneficial to detrimental for some primary producers, depending on species and organismal traits (medium confidence) (Gao et al., 2019; Seifert et al., 2020).Studies investigating two drivers provide most of the information on the wide range of interactive effects of drivers on phytoplankton (Gao et al., 2019; Seifert et al., 2020), although climate change alters several oceanic drivers concurrently (Section 3.2). The few experimental studies that have addressed three or more drivers (Xu et al., 2014; Boyd et al., 2015b; Brennan and Collins, 2015; Brennan et al., 2017; Hoppe et al., 2018b; Moreno-Marín et al., 2018) indicate that one or two drivers generally dominate the cumulative outcome, with others playing a subordinate role (medium confidence). In these studies, temperature had a disproportionately large influence, while other drivers differed in importance, depending on the type of primary producer, ecosystem characteristics and selected driver values.
