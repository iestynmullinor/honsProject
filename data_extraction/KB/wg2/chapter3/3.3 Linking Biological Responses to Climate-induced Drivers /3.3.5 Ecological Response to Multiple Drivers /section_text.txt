Assessing ecological responses to multiple climate-induced drivers requires a combination of approaches, including laboratory- and field-based experiments, field observations (e.g., natural gradients, climate analogues), study of paleo-analogues and the development of mechanistic and empirical models (Clapham, 2019; Gissi et al., 2021). Experimental studies of food-web responses are often limited to an individual driver, although recent manipulations have used a matrix of >1000-l mesocosms to explore ecological responses to both warming and acidification (see Box 3.1; Nagelkerken et al., 2020). Hence, complementary approaches are needed to indirectly explore the mechanisms underlying ecosystem responses to global climate change (Parmesan et al., 2013). Observations from time series longer than modes of natural variability (i.e., decades) are essential for revealing and attributing ecological responses to climate change (e.g., Section 3.4; Barton et al., 2015b; Brun et al., 2019). Also, paleorecords provide insights into the influence of multiple drivers on marine biota (Cross-Chapter Box PALEO in Chapter 1; Reddin et al., 2020). Specifically, associations between vulnerabilities and traits of marine ectotherms in laboratory experiments correspond with organismal responses to ancient hyperthermal events (medium confidence) (Reddin et al., 2020). This corroboration suggests that responses to multiple drivers inferred from the fossil record can help provide insights into the future status of functional groups, and hence food webs, under rapid climate change.Multi-species and integrated end-to-end ecosystem models are powerful tools to explore and project outcomes to the often-interacting cumulative effects of climate change and other anthropogenic drivers (Section 3.1; Kaplan and Marshall, 2016; Koenigstein et al., 2016; Peck and Pinnegar, 2018; Tittensor et al., 2018; Gissi et al., 2021). These models can integrate some aspects of the knowledge accrued from manipulation experiments, paleo- and contemporary observations, help test the relative importance of specific drivers and driver combinations, and identify synergistic or antagonistic responses (Koenigstein et al., 2016; Payne et al., 2016; Skogen et al., 2018; Tittensor et al., 2018). As these models are associated with wide-ranging uncertainties (SM3.2.2; Payne et al., 2016; Trolle et al., 2019; Heneghan et al., 2021), they cannot be expected to accurately project the trajectories of complex marine ecosystems under climate change; hence, they are most useful for assessing overall trends and in particular for providing a plausible envelope of trajectories across a range of assumptions (Fulton et al., 2018; Peck et al., 2018 ; Tittensor et al., 2018). On a global scale, ecosystem models project a −5.7 ± 4.1% (very likely range) to −15.5 ± 8.5% decline in marine animal biomass with warming under SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, by 2080–2099 relative to 1995–2014, albeit with significant regional variation in both trends and uncertainties (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.3.4; Tittensor et al., 2021). Biological interactions may exacerbate or buffer the projected impacts. For instance, trophic amplification (strengthening of responses to climate-induced drivers at higher trophic levels) may result from combined direct and indirect food-web-mediated effects (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.3.4; Lotze et al., 2019). Alternatively, compensatory species interactions can dampen strong impacts on species from ocean acidification, resulting in weaker responses at functional-group or community level than at species level (medium confidence) (Marshall et al., 2017; Hoppe et al., 2018b; Olsen et al., 2018; Gissi et al., 2021). Globally, the projected reduction of biomass due to climate-induced drivers is relatively unaffected by fishing pressure, indicating additive responses of fisheries and climate change (low confidence) (Lotze et al., 2019). Regionally, projected interactions of climate-induced drivers, fisheries and other regional non-climate drivers can be both synergistic and antagonistic, varying across regions, functional groups and species, and can cause nonlinear dynamics with counterintuitive outcomes, underlining the importance of adaptations and associated trade-offs (high confidence) (Sections 3.5.3, 3.6.3.1.2, 4.5, 4.6; Weijerman et al., 2015; Fulton et al., 2018; Hansen et al., 2019; Trolle et al., 2019; Zeng et al., 2019; Holsman et al., 2020; Pethybridge et al., 2020; Gissi et al., 2021).Given the limitations of individual ecological models discussed above, model intercomparisons, such as the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP; Tittensor et al., 2018) show promise in increasing the robustness of projected ecological outcomes (Tittensor et al., 2018). Model ensembles include a greater number of relevant processes and functional groups than any single model and thus capture a wider range of plausible responses. Among the global Fish-MIP models, there is high (temperate and tropical areas) to medium agreement  (coastal and polar regions) on the direction of change, but medium (temperate and tropical regions) to low agreement  (coastal and polar regions) on magnitude of change (Lotze et al., 2019; Heneghan et al., 2021). Although model outputs are validated relative to observations to assess model skills (Payne et al., 2016; Tittensor et al., 2018), the Fish-MIP models under-represent some sources of uncertainty, as they often do not include parameter uncertainties and do not usually include impacts of ocean acidification, oxygen loss or evolutionary responses because there remains high uncertainty regarding the influences of these processes across functional groups. Ensemble model investigations like Fish-MIP have also identified gaps in our mechanistic understanding of ecosystems and their responses to anthropogenic forcing, leading to model improvement and more rigorous benchmarking. These investigations could inspire future targeted observational and experimental research to test the validity of model assumptions (Payne et al., 2016; Lotze et al., 2019; Heneghan et al., 2021). The state of the art in such experimental research is presented in Box 3.1.
