The majority of the examples in Section 3.3 are from studies mimicking projected conditions in the year 2100 that report the responses of an individual species or strain to multiple drivers. This powerful generic experimental approach has largely been restricted to single species because it is logistically complex to conduct experiments that straddle multiple trophic levels, and that also include more than two drivers (see Figure Box 3.1.1b); the need for multiple replicates, drivers and treatment levels greatly increase the work required (Parmesan et al., 2013; Boyd et al., 2018). It is challenging to apply this experimental approach to communities or ecosystems (see Figure Box 3.1.1). To date, most research on community or ecosystem response to climate-induced drivers has been in large-volume (>10,000 l) mesocosms (Riebesell and Gattuso, 2014), or at natural analogues such as CO2 seeps, in which only one driver (ocean acidification) is altered (see (4) in Figure Box 3.1.1). Only very recently have two drivers been incorporated into climate-change manipulation studies examining responses of primary producers to secondary consumers (see (5) in Figure Box 3.1.1a; Nagelkerken et al., 2020). Therefore, ‘natural experiments’ from the geological past (Reddin et al., 2020) provide insights into how food webs and their constituents respond to complex change involving multiple drivers. Contemporary observations are occasionally long enough (>50 years) to capture community responses to complex climate change. For example, Brun et al. (2019) reported a shift in zooplankton community structure in the North Atlantic (1960–2014), with major biogeochemical ramifications.Conducting sufficiently long manipulation experiments to study the effect of adaptation on organisms is equally difficult (see Figure Box 3.1.1b), with much research restricted to multi-year studies of the microevolution of fast-growing (more than one division per day) phytoplankton species responding to single drivers (Lohbeck et al., 2012; Schaum et al., 2016). In a few experimental evolution studies (see (7) in Figure Box 3.1.1a; Brennan et al., 2017), multiple drivers have been used, but none have used communities or ecosystems (see Figure Box 3.1.1b). Nevertheless, the fossil record provides limited evidence of adaptations to less rapid (relative to present day) climate change (Jackson et al., 2018). Despite the need to explore ecological or biogeochemical responses to projected future ocean conditions, logistical challenges require that assessments of climate-change impacts at scales larger than mesocosms use large-scale, long-term in situ observational studies (as documented in Section 3.4).Figure Box 3.1.1 | Knowledge gaps between current scientific understanding and that needed to inform policy. The conceptual space relating driver number, (Driver axis), ecological organisation (Space axis) and evolutionary acclimation state (Time axis), modified from Riebesell and Gattuso (2014). (a)  Spheres indicate suites of studies that illustrate the progress of research, including multiple drivers: (1) one species and one driver (Hutchins et al., 2013); (2) one species and multiple drivers (five; Boyd et al., 2015a). Ecology: (1) one driver, one species; (3) one driver, planktonic community (Moustaka-Gouni et al., 2016); (4) one driver (high-CO2 seep) and (benthic) ecosystem (Fabricius et al., 2014); (5) two drivers and nearshore ecosystem (Nagelkerken et al., 2020). Evolution: (1) acclimated organism and one driver; (6) adapted organisms and one driver (Listmann et al., 2016); (7) adapted organism and multiple drivers (Brennan et al., 2017). (b)  Trends in research trajectories since 2000 from a survey of 171 studies (Boyd et al., 2018). Note the dominance of multiple-driver experiments at the species level (lower left cluster); the focus on acclimation (red triangle) rather than adaptation (blue dot); and the focus of investigation on three or fewer drivers.
