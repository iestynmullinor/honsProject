Epipelagic isotherms have recently (1980–2015) deepened at an average of 6.6 ± 18.8 m per decade (Pinsky et al., 2019), but there is low agreement  on whether species move deeper in pursuit of thermal refuge. Prior studies suggested range shifts to depth (Dulvy et al., 2008; Pinsky et al., 2013; Yemane et al., 2014), but increasing evidence suggests that fish and planktonic communities across large parts of the North Atlantic, sub-Arctic and northeast Pacific Ocean redistribute horizontally with horizontal climate velocity, except where vertical temperature gradients are particularly steep. There is low confidence for temperature-driven depth shifts in the epipelagic zone (Burrows et al., 2019; Campana et al., 2020; Caves and Johnsen, 2021). At the same time, decreasing oxygen concentrations and the vertical expansion of OMZs have already decreased suitable habitat of pelagic fishes, including tuna and billfishes, by ~15% primarily due to vertical compression of environmental niches (Stramma et al., 2012; Deutsch et al., 2015).
