Responses to abrupt climate change in the geological past suggest that adaptive capacity is limited for marine animals (Cross-Chapter Box PALEO in Chapter 1). Temperatures during the last Interglacial (~125 ka), which were warmer than today, led to poleward range shifts of reef corals (medium confidence) (Kiessling et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2019a). Temperature has also driven marine range shifts over multi-million-year time scales (medium confidence) (Gibbs et al., 2016; Reddin et al., 2018). Warming climates, even with low ocean-warming rates, inevitably decreased tropical marine biodiversity compared with middle latitudes (high confidence) (Mannion et al., 2014; Crame, 2020; Yasuhara et al., 2020; Raja and Kiessling, 2021).The paleorecord confirms that marine biodiversity has been vulnerable to climate warming both globally and regionally (very high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box PALEO in Chapter 1; Stanley, 2016). In extreme cases of warming (e.g., >5.2°C), marine mass extinctions occurred in the geological past, and there may be a relationship between warming magnitude and extinction toll (medium confidence) (Song et al., 2021b). A combination of warming and spreading anoxia caused marine extinctions in ancient episodes of rapid climate warming (high confidence) (Bond and Grasby, 2017; Benton, 2018; Penn et al., 2018; Them II et al., 2018; Chen and Xu, 2019). The role of ocean acidification in ancient extinctions is yet to be resolved (low confidence) (Clapham and Payne, 2011; Clarkson et al., 2015; Jurikova et al., 2020; Müller et al., 2020).
