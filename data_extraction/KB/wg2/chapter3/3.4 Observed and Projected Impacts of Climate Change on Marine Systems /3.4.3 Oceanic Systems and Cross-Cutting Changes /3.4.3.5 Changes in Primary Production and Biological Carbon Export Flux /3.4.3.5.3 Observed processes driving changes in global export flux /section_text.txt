The SROCCmedium confidence assessment that warming, stratification, declines in productivity and changes in plankton community in the epipelagic zone result in reduced export of primary production to deeper layers (Table 3.24) is supported by subsequent literature (Bach et al., 2019; Leung et al., 2021). Particulate organic carbon export efficiency is constrained by altered mixing and nutrient availability (Boyd et al., 2019; Lundgreen et al., 2019), particle fragmentation (Briggs et al., 2020) as well as viral, microbial and planktonic community structure (Fu et al., 2016; Guidi et al., 2016; Flombaum et al., 2020; Kaneko et al., 2021) and metabolic rates (Cavan et al., 2019). These processes are strongly interlinked, and their net effect on primary production export from the upper ocean remains difficult to quantify observationally (Boyd et al., 2019). Since SROCC, there is increasing evidence that ocean deoxygenation can alter zooplankton community structure (Wishner et al., 2018), zooplankton respiration rates (Cass and Daly, 2014; Cavan et al., 2017) and patterns of diel vertical migration (Aumont et al., 2018), which may focus remineralisation of organic carbon at the upper margins of OMZs (Section 3.4.3.4 on depth shifts due to OMZ; Bianchi et al., 2013; Archibald et al., 2019).Data on export flux from the upper ocean are limited either in coverage and consistency (ship-board sampling) or duration (sediment traps), and are subject to considerable spatial variability (as shown in satellite observations (Boyd et al., 2019). As a result, trends are weak, inconsistent and often not statistically significant (Lomas et al., 2010; Cael et al., 2017; Muller-Karger et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2019). Deep-ocean fluxes are similarly equivocal (Smith et al., 2018; Fischer et al., 2019; Fischer et al., 2020). In coming years, an increasing number of Argo floats equipped with bio-optical sensors should help improve estimates of particle flux spatio-temporal variability (e.g., Dall’Olmo et al., 2016).Projected changesSROCC and WGI AR6 reported global declines in POC export flux, from −8.9 to −15.8% by 2100 relative to 2000 under RCP8.5 in CMIP5 models, and −2.5 to −21.5% (median value: −14%) between 1900 and 2100 under SSP5-8.5 in CMIP6 models (Table 3.24; WGI AR6 5.4.4.2; Bindoff et al., 2019a; Canadell et al., 2021). In CMIP5 model runs, the decrease in the sinking flux of organic matter from the upper ocean into the ocean interior was strongly related to the changes in stratification that reduce net nutrient supply (Fu et al., 2016; Bindoff et al., 2019a), especially in tropical regions, and the projections for global export production changes are reported with medium confidence. Increasing model complexity with more widespread representation of ocean biogeochemical processes between CMIP5 and CMIP6, and inclusion of more than one or two classes of phyto- and zooplankton, will provide opportunities to improve assessments of how climate-induced drivers affect different components of biological carbon pump in the epipelagic ocean, as well as changes in the efficiency and magnitude of carbon export in the deep ocean (high confidence) (see Box 3.3; Le Quéré et al., 2016; Séférian et al., 2020; Wright et al., 2021).
