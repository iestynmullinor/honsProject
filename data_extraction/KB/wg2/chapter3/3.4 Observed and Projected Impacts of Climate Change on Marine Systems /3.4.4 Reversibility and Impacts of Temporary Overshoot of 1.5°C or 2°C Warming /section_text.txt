Scenarios limiting warming to the 1.5°C and 2°C limits in the Paris Agreement can involve temporarily exceeding those warming levels before declining again (WGI AR6 Section 4.6.2.1; Lee et al., 2021). The effect of such ‘overshoot’ on marine and coastal ecosystems depends on the reversibility of both the response of climate-induced drivers and the response of organisms and ecosystems to the climate impact-drivers during the overshoot period. WGI AR6 assessed that temporary overshoot of a 2°C warming threshold has irreversible effects on global mean sea level and also effects on ocean heat content that persist beyond 2100 (WGI AR6 Section 4.6.2.1; Lee et al., 2021). Model results indicate that sea surface temperatures (high confidence), Arctic sea ice (high confidence), surface ocean acidification (very high confidence) and surface ocean deoxygenation (very high confidence) are reversible within years to decades if net emissions reach zero or below (WGI AR6 Table 4.10; Lee et al., 2021). Although changes in these surface ocean variables are reversible, habitat-forming ecosystems, including coral reefs and kelp forests, may undergo irreversible phase shifts with >1.5°C warming (Sections 3.4.2.1, 3.4.2.3), and are thus at high risk this century in 1.5°C or 2°C scenarios involving overshoot (Tachiiri et al., 2019). In an overshoot scenario in which CO2 returns to 2040 levels by 2100 (SSP5-3.4-OS; O’Neill et al., 2016), SST and Arctic sea ice do not fully return by 2100 to levels prior to the CO2 peak (medium confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 4.6.2.1; Lee et al., 2021), suggesting that reversal of marine ecological impacts from 21st century climate impacts would extend into the 22nd century or beyond (McManus et al., 2021). Models also indicate that global sea level rise, as well as warming, ocean acidification and deoxygenation at depth, are irreversible for centuries or longer (very high confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 4.6.2.1 and Table 4.10; Palter et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020c; Lee et al., 2021).
