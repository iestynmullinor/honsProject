Sea ice is a key driver of polar marine life, hosting unique ecosystems and affecting diverse marine organisms and food webs through its impact on light penetration and supplies of nutrients and organic matter (Arrigo, 2014). Since the late 1970s, Arctic sea ice area has decreased for all months, with an estimated decrease of 2 million km 2 (or 25%) for summer sea ice (averaged for August, September and October) in 2010–2019 as compared with 1979–1988 (WGI AR6 Section 9.3.1.1; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). For Antarctic sea ice there is no significant global trend in satellite-observed sea ice area from 1979 to 2020 in either winter or summer, due to regionally opposing trends and large internal variability (WGI AR6 Section 9.3.2.1; Maksym, 2019; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).CMIP6 simulations project that the Arctic Ocean will likely  become practically sea ice free (area below 1 million km 2) for the first time before 2050 and in the seasonal sea ice minimum in each of the four emission scenarios SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 (Figure 3.7; WGI AR6 Section 9.3.2.2; Notze and SIMIP Community, 2020; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). Antarctic sea ice area is also projected to decrease during the 21st century, but due to mismatches between model simulations and observations, combined with a lack of understanding of reasons for substantial inter-model spread, there is low confidence in model projections of future Antarctic sea ice changes, particularly at the regional level (WGI AR6 Section 9.3.2.2; Roach et al., 2020; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021).
