Paleoclimatology observations are useful to assess multiple hazards of environmental change while excluding direct anthropogenic impacts (Section 3.4.3.3). Ancient intervals of rapid climate warming that occurred between 300 and 50 million years ago (Ma) were triggered by the release of greenhouse gases (high confidence). The sources of greenhouse gases varied but include volcanic degassing from continental flood basalts and methane hydrates stored in marine sediments and soils (Foster et al., 2018). Six extreme ancient hyperthermal events are known from the last 300 Ma, when tropical SSTs reached 1.5°C–10°C warmer than pre-industrial conditions, and with substantial impacts on ancient life (Cross-Chapter Box PALEO in Chapter 1). Warming and deoxygenation in the oceans were closely associated in hyperthermal events (high confidence), with anoxia reaching the photic zone and abyssal depths (Kaiho et al., 2014; Müller et al., 2017; Penn et al., 2018; Weissert, 2019), whereas ocean acidification has not been demonstrated consistently (medium confidence) (Hönisch et al., 2012; Penman et al., 2014; Clarkson et al., 2015; Harper et al., 2020a; Jurikova et al., 2020; Müller et al., 2020).Greenhouse gases also contributed substantially to shaping the longer-term climate trends over the past 50 million years, although changes in continental configuration and ocean circulation as well as planetary orbital cycles were equally important (WGI AR6 Cross-Chapter Box 2.1 in Chapter 2; Westerhold et al., 2020; Gulev et al., 2021). There is little evidence for ocean acidification in the past 2.6 Ma (low confidence) (Hönisch et al., 2012), but ocean ventilation was highly sensitive to even modest warming such as observed in the past 10,000 years (medium confidence) (Jaccard and Galbraith, 2012; Lembke-Jene et al., 2018).
