Ocean deoxygenation, the loss of oxygen in the ocean, results from ocean warming, through a reduction in oxygen saturation, increased oxygen consumption, increased ocean stratification and ventilation changes (Keeling et al., 2010; IPCC, 2019a). In recent decades, anthropogenic inputs of nutrients and organic matter (Section 3.1) have increased the extent, duration and intensity of coastal hypoxia events worldwide (Diaz and Rosenberg, 2008; Rabalais et al., 2010; Breitburg et al., 2018), while pollution-induced atmospheric deposition of soluble iron over the ocean has accelerated open-ocean deoxygenation (Ito et al., 2016). Deoxygenation and acidification often coincide because biological consumption of oxygen produces CO2. Deoxygenation can have a range of detrimental effects on marine organisms and reduce the extent of marine habitats (Sections 3.3.2, 3.4.3.1; Vaquer-Sunyer and Duarte, 2008; Chu and Tunnicliffe, 2015).Changes in ocean oxygen concentrations have been analysed from compilations of in situ data dating back to the 1960s (Helm et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2017; Schmidtko et al., 2017). SROCC concluded that a loss of oxygen had occurred in the upper 1000 m of the ocean (medium confidence), with a global mean decrease of 0.5–3.3% (very likely range) over 1970–2010 (Bindoff et al., 2019a). Based on new regional assessments (Queste et al., 2018; Bronselaer et al., 2020; Cummins and Ross, 2020; Stramma et al., 2020), WGI AR6 assesses that ocean deoxygenation has occurred in most regions of the open ocean since the mid-20th century (high confidence), but it is modified by climate variability on interannual and inter-decadal time scales (medium confidence) (WGI AR6 Sections 2.3.3.6, 5.3.3.2; Canadell et al., 2021; Gulev et al., 2021). New findings since SROCC also confirm that the volume of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) are expanding at many locations (high confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 5.3.3.2; Canadell et al., 2021).The most recent estimates of future oxygen loss in the subsurface ocean (100–600 m), using CMIP6 models, amount to −4.1 ± 4.2 (very likely range), −6.6 ± 5.7, −10.1 ± 6.7 and −11.2 ± 7.7% in 2081–2100 relative to 1995–2014 for SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, respectively (Figure 3.5; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). Based on these CMIP6 projections, WGI AR6 concludes that the oxygen content of the subsurface ocean is projected to decline to historically unprecedented conditions over the 21st century (medium confidence) (WGI AR6 Section 5.3.3.2; Canadell et al., 2021). These declines are greater (by 31–72%) than simulated by the CMIP5 models in their Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) analogues, a likely  consequence of enhanced surface warming and stratification in CMIP6 models (Figure 3.5; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). At the regional scale and for subsurface waters, projected changes are not spatially uniform, and there is lower agreement  among models than they show for the global mean trend (Bopp et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2020). In particular, large uncertainties remain for these future projections of ocean deoxygenation in the subsurface tropical oceans, where the major OMZs are located (Cabré et al., 2015; Bopp et al., 2017).
