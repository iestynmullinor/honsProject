Climate change exposes ocean and coastal ecosystems to changing environmental conditions, including ocean warming, SLR, acidification, deoxygenation and other climatic impact-drivers (CIDs), which have distinct regional and temporal characteristics (Gruber, 2011; IPCC, 2018). This section aims to build on the WGI AR6 assessment (Table 3.2) to provide an ecosystem-oriented framing of CIDs. Updating SROCC, projected trends assessed here are based on a new range of scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, SSPs), as used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6; Section 1.2.2).Table 3.2 | Overview of the main global ocean climatic impact-drivers and their observed and projected trends from WGI AR6, with corresponding confidence levels and links to WGI chapters where these trends are assessed in detailClimatic impact-drivers (hazards)Observed trends over the historical periodWGI sectionProjected trends over the 21st centuryWGI sectionOcean temperatureOcean warming‘At the ocean surface, temperature has on average increased by 0.88 [0.68–1.01] °C from 1850–1900 to 2011–2020.’2.3.3.1, 9.2.1(Fox-Kemper et al., 2021;
