Marine-focused adaptations show promise in helping achieve social SDGs, especially when they are designed to achieve multiple benefits (medium confidence) (Figure 3.26; Ntona and Morgera, 2018; Claudet et al., 2020a). Technology- and infrastructure-focused adaptations (Section 3.6.2.2) can help relieve coastal communities from risks associated with poverty (SDG1), hunger (SDG2), health and water sanitation (SDG3 and SDG6), and inequality (SDG10) by supporting aquaculture (Sections 3.5.3, 3.6.3.1), alerting the public about poor water quality (Sections 3.5.5.3, 3.6.3.1) and empowering marginalised groups, such as women and Indigenous Peoples, with decision-relevant information (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Sections 3.5.5.3, 3.6.3.1). Effectively implemented and managed marine NbS (Section 3.6.2.3) contribute to attainment of social SDGs by: (a) preserving biodiversity (Carlton and Fowler, 2018; Warner, 2018; Scheffers and Pecl, 2019), which benefits most ocean and coastal ecosystem services (Section 3.5.3; Figure 3.22); (b) increasing marine fishery and aquaculture sustainability (Section 3.6.3); (c) including vulnerable people and communities in management (Section 3.6.3.2.1); (d) lowering risk of flooding from storms and SLR (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Sections 3.6.3.1.1); and (e) implementing spatial-management tools that make room for new uses like renewable-energy development (Section 3.6.3.3.4). Nature-based solutions can therefore help support achievement of No Poverty (SDG1) (Ntona and Morgera, 2018), Zero Hunger (SDG2), Good Health and Well-Being (SDG3) (Duarte et al., 2020), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7) (Fuso Nerini et al., 2019; Levin et al., 2020) and Reduced Inequality (SDG10). Socio-institutional marine adaptations (Section 3.6.2.2) that support current livelihoods and help develop alternatives can contribute to attainment of social SDGs by enhancing social equity and supporting societal transformation (medium confidence) (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2019; Pelling and Garschagen, 2019; Nash et al., 2021). Even societal changes that are not directly marine related can decrease human vulnerability to ocean and coastal climate risks by improving overall human adaptive capacity (Section 1.2).Marine adaptation also shows promise for helping support achievement of economic SDGs (medium confidence) (Figure 3.26). Marine NbS could help blue-economy frameworks achieve Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG8) (Lee et al., 2020) by sustainably and equitably incorporating ecosystem-based fisheries management, restoration or conservation (Sections 3.6.3.1.2, 3.6.3.2.1, 3.6.3.2.2; Voyer et al., 2018; Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2019; Okafor-Yarwood et al., 2020). Nature-based solutions that involve active restoration or accommodation can contribute to Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11) and Infrastructure (SDG9) (Section 3.6.3.1.1). Newly developed marine industries and livelihoods associated with NbS might support attainment of Sustainable Communities (SDG11) (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2019). Finance and market mechanisms to support disaster relief or ocean ecosystem services, such as blue carbon or food provisioning, and innovations (SDG9) including new technologies like vessel-monitoring systems (Kroodsma et al., 2018), can contribute to Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG12) (Sumaila and Tai, 2020). Blue-economy growth that includes sustainable shipping, tourism, renewable ocean energy and transboundary fisheries management (Pinsky et al., 2018) have the potential to contribute to Economic Development (SDG8), affordable and clean energy (SDG7) as well as global mitigation efforts (SDG13) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019b; Duarte et al., 2020). Participatory approaches and co-management systems (Section 3.6.2.1) in many maritime sectors can contribute to SDG11 and SDG12 while helping align the blue economy and the SDGs (high agreement ) (Lee et al., 2020; Okafor-Yarwood et al., 2020).Developing marine adaptation pathways that offer multiple benefits requires transformational adaptation (high confidence) (Claudet et al., 2020a; Friedman et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2020b; Nash et al., 2021) that avoids risky and maladaptive actions (Magnan and Duvat, 2018; Ojea et al., 2020). Ocean and coastal extreme events and other hazards disproportionately harm the most vulnerable communities in SIDS, tropical and Arctic regions, and Indigenous Peoples (Chapter 8.2.1.2). Presently implemented adaptation activity, at the aggregate level, adversely affects multiple gender targets under SDG5 (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18). Although women make up over half of the global seafood production workforce (fishing and processing sectors), provide more than half the artisanal landings in the Pacific region (Harper et al., 2013), dominate some seafood sectors such as seaweed (Howard and Pecl, 2019) and shellfish harvesting (Turner et al., 2020a) and account for 11% of global artisanal fisheries participants (Harper et al., 2020b), they are often not specifically counted in datasets and excluded from decision making and support programmes (Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18; Harper et al., 2020b; Michalena et al., 2020). Targeted efforts to incorporate knowledge diversity, and include artisanal fishers, women and Indigenous Peoples within international, regional and local policy planning, promote marine adaptation that supports achievement of gender equality (SDG5) and reduces inequalities (SDG10) (limited evidence, high agreement ) (FAO, 2015). Integrated planning, financing and implementation can help overcome these limitations (Section 3.6.3.3.2; Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17), ensuring that marine adaptations do not compromise overall human equity or specific SDGs (Ã–sterblom et al., 2020; Nash et al., 2021), but are in fact fully synergistic with these goals (Bennett et al., 2021).
