The intricacy, scope, time scales and uncertainties associated with climate change challenge ocean governance, which already is extremely complex because it encompasses a variety of overlapping spatial scales, concerns and governance structures (see Figure CB3.1 in SROCC Chapter 1; Prakash et al., 2019). Assessment of how established global agreements and regional, sectoral or scientific bodies address climate adaptation and resilience, and how current practices can be improved, is found in SM3.5.3.There is growing momentum to include the ocean in international climate policy (robust evidence), paving the way for a more integrated approach to both mitigation and adaptation. Following adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the UN SDGs (Table 3.31) came into force in 2016, including SDG14 specifically dedicated to Life Below Water (Table 3.31). In 2017, the first UN Ocean Conference was held (United Nations, 2017), the UNFCCC adopted the Ocean Pathway to increase ocean-targeted multilateral climate action (COP23, 2017) and the UN Assembly declared 2021–2030 the Decade for Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (Visbeck, 2018; Lee et al., 2020). Next, 14 world leaders formed the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy to produce the New Ocean Action Agenda, founded on 100% sustainable management of national ocean spaces by 2025 (Ocean Panel, 2020). All of these initiatives position oceans centrally within the climate-policy and biodiversity-conservation landscapes and seek to develop a coherent effort and common frameworks to achieve marine sustainability (Visbeck, 2018; Lee et al., 2020), new economic opportunities (Konar and Ding, 2020; Lee et al., 2020), more equitable outcomes (Österblom et al., 2020) and decisive climate mitigation and adaptation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a), to achieve truly transformative change (Claudet et al., 2020a).Table 3.31 |  Sustainable Development Goals, grouped into broader categories as discussed in this section aCategoryGoalSocietySDG1: No PovertySDG2: Zero HungerSDG3: Good Health and Well-BeingSDG4: Quality EducationSDG5: Gender EqualitySDG6: Clean Water and SanitationSDG7: Affordable and Clean EnergyEconomySDG8: Decent Work and Economic GrowthSDG9: Industry, Innovation and InfrastructureSDG10: Reduced InequalitySDG11: Sustainable Cities and CommunitiesSDG12: Responsible Consumption and ProductionEnvironmentSDG13: Climate ActionSDG14: Life Below WaterSDG15: Life on LandGovernanceSDG16: Peace and Justice Strong InstitutionsSDG17: Partnerships to Achieve the Goals(a) See http://sdgs.un.org/goals There is high confidence in the literature that multilateral environmental agreements need better alignment and integration to support achievement of ambitious international development, climate mitigation and adaptation goals (Swilling et al., 202; Duarte et al., 2020; Friedman et al., 2020; Conservation International and IUCN, 2021; Pörtner et al., 2021b; Sumaila et al., 2021). The ocean targets of the CBD (e.g., the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework), the SDGs (Agenda 2030) and the Paris Agreement are already inclusive and synergistic (Duarte et al., 2020). However, specific policy instruments and sectors within them could be additionally integrated, especially to address such cross-cutting impacts as ocean acidification and deoxygenation (Gallo et al., 2017; Bindoff et al., 2019a), increasing plastic pollution (Ostle et al., 2019; Duarte et al., 2020), high-seas governance (Johnson et al., 2019; Leary, 2019) or deep-sea uses (Wright et al., 2019; Levin et al., 2020; Orejas et al., 2020). National adaptation plans present opportunities to synergistically build on mitigation to support equitable development (Morioka et al., 2020), economic planning (Dundas et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2020) and ocean stewardship (von Schuckmann et al., 2020). Alignment of multilateral agreements is expected to increase mitigation impact as well as increase adaptation options (Section 3.6.3; Figure 3.25; Roberts et al., 2020). Opportunities to improve multilateral environmental agreements and policies beyond UNFCCC and CBD processes are discussed in SM3.5.3, and an assessment of commercial species-management initiatives and needs is in Chapter 5.
