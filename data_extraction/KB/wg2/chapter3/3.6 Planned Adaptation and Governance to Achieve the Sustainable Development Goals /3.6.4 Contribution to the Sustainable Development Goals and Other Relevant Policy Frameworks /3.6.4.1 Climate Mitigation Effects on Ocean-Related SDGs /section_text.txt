SROCC underscored the need for ambitious mitigation to control climate hazards in the ocean to achieve SDGs (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Bindoff et al., 2019a; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). Delays in achieving ocean-dependent SDGs observed in SROCC and SR15 can be addressed with ambitious planned adaptation and mitigation action (high agreement ) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019b). Since the ocean can contribute substantially to the attainment of mitigation targets aiming to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019b), and to adaptation solutions facilitating attainment of social and economic SDGs, climate policy is treating the ocean less as a victim of climate change and more as a central participant in solving the global climate challenge (Cooley et al., 2019; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a; Dundas et al., 2020).Relationships between Climate Action (SDG13) targets and SDG14 targets are mostly synergistic (Figure 3.26; Fuso Nerini et al., 2019). Responding to climate-change impacts requires transformative governance (high confidence) (Chapters 1, 18; Collins et al., 2019a; Brodie Rudolph et al., 2020; Claudet et al., 2020a), especially for extreme events and higher-impact scenarios (e.g., higher emissions) (Fedele et al., 2019), and for achieving SDGs through one of the global ecosystems transitions (Chapter 18; Sachs et al., 2019; Brodie Rudolph et al., 2020). Opportunities to transform ocean governance exist in developing new international and local agreements, regulations and policies that reduce the risks of relocating ocean and coastal activities (Section 3.6.3.1.1) or in reinventing established practices (Section 3.6.3.3.3). Policy transformations improving ocean sustainability under SDG14 also help address SDG13 (Brodie Rudolph et al., 2020; Dundas et al., 2020; Claudet, 2021; Sumaila et al., 2021). Emergent situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may provide opportunities to implement transformative ‘green recovery plans’ that support achievement of the SDGs and NDCs (Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7).Figure 3.26 | Synergies and trade-offs between SDG13 Climate Action, SDG14 Life Below Water and social, economic and governance SDGs. Achieving SDG13 provides positive outcomes and supports the achievement of all SDG14 targets. In turn, meeting SDG14 drives mostly positive interactions with social, economic and governance SDGs. The interaction types, ‘Indivisible’ (inextricably linked to the achievement of another goal), ‘Reinforcing’ (aids the achievement of another goal), ‘Enabling’ (creates conditions that further another goal), ‘Consistent’ (no significant positive or negative interactions) and ‘Constraining’ (limits options on another goal), follow Nilsson et al.’s (2016) scoring system based on the authors’ assessment, and agreement denotes consistency across author ratings.
