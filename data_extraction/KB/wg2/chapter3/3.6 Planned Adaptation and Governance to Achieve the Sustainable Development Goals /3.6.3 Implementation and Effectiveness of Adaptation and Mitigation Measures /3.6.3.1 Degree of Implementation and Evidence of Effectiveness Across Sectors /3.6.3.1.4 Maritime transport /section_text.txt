Increased maritime transport and cruise-ship tourism in the Arctic are already impacting local and Indigenous Peoples, revealing conflicts over the uses of the ocean and the governance needed to support local people and a sustainable blue economy (high confidence) (Debortoli et al., 2019; Palma et al., 2019; Berman et al., 2020; Dundas et al., 2020). While shipping and its associated environmental impacts are projected to grow (Palma et al., 2019; Dawson et al., 2020), adaptation efforts are only at the planning stage (Debortoli et al., 2019). Increased Arctic traffic due to ice loss can benefit trade, transportation and tourism (medium confidence), but will also affect Arctic marine ecosystems and livelihoods (high confidence) (Palma et al., 2019; Dawson et al., 2020). Increasing search-and-rescue activities (Ford and Clark, 2019) reveal capacity gaps to support future demands (Ford and Clark, 2019; Palma et al., 2019). The Low-Impact Shipping Corridors initiative has been developed as an adaptation strategy in the Arctic, although with limited inclusion of IKLK (Dawson et al., 2020).Relative SLR and the increased frequency and severity of storms are already affecting port activity, infrastructure and supply chains, sometimes disrupting trade and transport (Monios and Wilmsmeier, 2020), but these hazards are not systematically incorporated into adaptation planning (medium evidence) (Monios and Wilmsmeier, 2020; O’Keeffe et al., 2020). Climate-change impacts that increase food insecurity, income loss and poverty can exacerbate maritime criminal activity, including illegal fishing, drug trafficking or piracy (medium evidence) (Germond and Mazaris, 2019). A transformational adaptation approach to address climate impacts on maritime activities and increase security (Germond and Mazaris, 2019) would relocate ports, change centres of demand, reduce shipping distances or shorten supply chains (medium agreement ) (Walsh et al., 2019; Monios and Wilmsmeier, 2020) as well as decrease marginalisation of vulnerable groups, develop polycentric governance systems and eliminate maladaptive environmental policies and resource loss (Belhabib et al., 2020; O’Keeffe et al., 2020).
