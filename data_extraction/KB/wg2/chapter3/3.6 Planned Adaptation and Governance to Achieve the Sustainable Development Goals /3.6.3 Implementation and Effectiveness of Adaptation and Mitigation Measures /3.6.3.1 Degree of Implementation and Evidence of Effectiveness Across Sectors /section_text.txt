Health-focused adaptations to climate-driven changes in ocean and coastal water quality (Section 3.5.5.3) leverage mainly technology and infrastructure (Section 3.6.2.2) to improve water-quality monitoring and forecasting to inform socio-institutional adaptation (Section 3.6.2.1) and NbS (Section 3.6.2.3). Seafood quality and safety are decreasing due to climate-driven increases in marine-borne diseases (Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2), toxic HABs or toxin bioaccumulation (high agreement ) (Karagas et al., 2012; Krabbenhoft and Sunderland, 2013; Rafaj et al., 2013; Curtis et al., 2019; Schartup et al., 2019; Thackray and Sunderland, 2019). Future exposure to seafood-borne contaminants also depends partly on consumers’ seafood preferences (Elsayed et al., 2020) and seafood supply (Sunderland et al., 2018). Reducing this risk by decreasing seafood consumption increases the risk of eating less nutritious foods, and loss of cultural practices (Chapter 5; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING SPECIES in Chapter 5; Donatuto et al., 2011; Bindoff et al., 2019a). Models incorporating high-resolution satellite images, field survey data, meteorological observations and historical records can provide early-warning forecasts of HABs or conditions that favour microbial pathogen outbreaks (Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2; Semenza et al., 2017; Franks, 2018; Hattenrath-Lehmann et al., 2018; Borbor-Cordova et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2019; Campbell et al., 2020a; Davidson et al., 2021). Forecasts facilitate preventive public health measures (World Health Organisation and United Nations Children’s Fund, 2017), or seafood harvest guidance (Maguire et al., 2016; Leadbetter et al., 2018; Anderson et al., 2019; Bolin et al., 2021), reducing risks of disease outbreaks, waste and contaminated seafood entering the market (medium confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2; Nichols et al., 2018). Monitoring of water quality and seafood safety (Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2), paired with effective public communication and education (Ekstrom et al., 2020), inform individual and local adaptations, including use of (a) personal protective equipment, (b) seafood selection and preparation (Elsayed et al., 2020; Froelich and Daines, 2020; Fielding et al., 2021), (c) income diversification (Section 3.6.2.1; Moore et al., 2020b), (d) public education (Borbor-Cordova et al., 2019) or (e) community-level actions to decrease risk from coastal aquifer and soil salinisation (Slama et al., 2020; Mastrocicco and Colombani, 2021), HAB toxins (Ekstrom et al., 2020) and other contaminants (e.g., methylmercury, metals, persistent organic pollutants) in seafood (Chan et al., 2021). A full assessment of climate-change impacts on human health is found in Chapter 7 and Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2.
