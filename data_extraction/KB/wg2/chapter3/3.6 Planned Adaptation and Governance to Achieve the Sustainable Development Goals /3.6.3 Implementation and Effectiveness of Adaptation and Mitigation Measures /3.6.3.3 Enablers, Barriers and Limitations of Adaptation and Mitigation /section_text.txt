Ocean and coastal NbS can contribute to global mitigation efforts, especially with ocean renewable energy and restoration and preservation of carbon ecosystems (see Box 3.4; Section 3.6.2.3). Technological, economic and financing barriers presently hamper development of renewable ocean energy (AR6 WGIII Chapter 6). Such development could help small nations reliant on imported fuel meet their climate-mitigation goals and decrease risk from global fuel-supply dynamics (Millar et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018a), but progress is limited by lack of investment (Millar et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2020) or equipment (Aderinto and Li, 2018; Rusu and Onea, 2018). Wave-energy installations, possibly co-located with wind turbines (Perez-Collazo et al., 2018), are promising for both low- to middle-income nations and areas with significant island or remote coastal geographies (Lavidas and Venugopal, 2016; Bergillos et al., 2018; Jakimaviƒçius et al., 2018; Kompor et al., 2018; Penalba et al., 2018; Saprykina and Kuznetsov, 2018; Lavidas, 2019). Wave-energy capture may also diminish storm-induced coastal erosion (Abanades et al., 2018; Bergillos et al., 2018). Tidal energy is a relatively new technology (Haslett et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Neill et al., 2018) with limiting siting requirements (Mofor et al., 2013). Ocean renewable-energy expansion faces other technological obstacles including lack of implementable or scalable energy-capture devices, access to offshore sites, competing coastal uses, potential environmental impacts and lack of power-grid infrastructure at the coast (Aderinto and Li, 2018; Neill et al., 2018).
