Every coastal community values marine ecosystems for more than the material and intangible resources they deliver, or the physical protection they offer (Díaz et al., 2018). Cultural services that provide identity, spiritual and cultural continuity, religious meaning or options for the future (e.g., genetic or mineral resources) (Bindoff et al., 2019a) are not substitutable. Furthermore, interactions between climate impacts and existing inequalities can threaten the human rights of already-marginalised peoples by disrupting livelihoods and food security, which further erodes people’s social, economic and cultural rights (Finkbeiner et al., 2018). For instance, European colonisation and ongoing development blocked the Cucapá Indigenous People’s access and rights to resources in the Colorado River Delta, USA, over the 20th century. Recent reallocation of water rights and fishing access is allowing the Cucapá people to reconstruct their cultural identity (Sangha et al., 2019), but future climate-change impacts could reverse the community’s recovery of their cultural heritage. Adaptations that consider local needs may help sustain cultural services (Ortíz Liñán and Vázquez Solís, 2021).Interactions with oceans are fundamental to the identities of many coastal Indigenous Peoples (Norman, 2017), and this influences Indigenous responses to climate hazards and adaptation. Around 30 million Indigenous Peoples live along coasts (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2016). Seafood consumption among Indigenous Peoples is much higher than for non-Indigenous populations, and marine species support many cultural, medicinal and traditional activities contributing to public health (Section 3.5.3.1; Kenny et al., 2018). Perpetuation of Indigenous cultures depends on protecting marine ecosystems and on adapting to changes in self-led ways (Section 3.5.6; Sangha et al., 2019) that promote self-determination (von der Porten et al., 2019). Indigenous resurgence, or reinvigorating Indigenous ways of life and traditional management, can include marine resource protection and ocean-sector development founded on culturally appropriate strategies and partnerships that are consistent with traditional norms and beneficial to local communities (von der Porten et al., 2019). Successful adaptation would simultaneously improve ecosystem health and address current and historical inequities (Bennett, 2018). Examples include practicing traditional resource management, protecting traditional territories, engaging with monitoring, collaborations with non-Indigenous partners and reinvesting benefits into capacity-building within communities (von der Porten et al., 2019; Equator Initiative, 2020). The legitimacy of different adaptation strategies depends on local and Indigenous Peoples’ acceptance, which is based on cultural values (Adger et al., 2017); financial gain cannot compensate for loss of IK or LK (Wilson et al., 2020b). Palau’s recent goal of shifting seafood consumption away from reef fishes (Remengesau Jr., 2019) as well as limiting and closely monitoring the expansion of ecotourism was prompted by the cultural importance of protecting these reefs and associated traditional fisheries for local consumption, a recognition of the importance of tourism and the hazard of climate change (Wabnitz et al., 2018a).Adaptations implemented at the local level that consider IKLK systems are beneficial (high confidence) (Nalau et al., 2018; Sultana et al., 2019). Studies in SIDS and the Arctic have shown how IKLK facilitate the success of EbA (Nalau et al., 2018; Peñaherrera-Palma et al., 2018; Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel, 2018), reinforce and improve institutional approaches and enhance the provision of ecosystem services (Ross et al., 2019; Terra Stori et al., 2019). Perspectives on adaptation also vary among groups of age, race, (dis)ability, class, caste and gender (Wilson et al., 2020b), so engaging different groups results in more robust and equitable adaptation to climate change (Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18; McLeod et al., 2018). Some coastal communities have developed substantial social capital and dense local networks based on trust and reciprocity (Petzold and Ratter, 2015), with individual and community flexibility to learn, adapt and organise themselves to help local adaptation governance (Silva et al., 2020). Recent evidence suggests that policies supporting local institutions can improve adaptation outcomes (medium confidence) (Berman et al., 2020). Coastal communities can be engaged using novel approaches to co-generate adaptation solutions (van der Voorn et al., 2017; Flood et al., 2018) that benefit education (Koenigstein et al., 2020) and engagement in adaptation processes (Rumore et al., 2016). Successful adaptation implementation in line with climate resilient development pathways (WGII Chapter 18) depends on bottom-up, participatory and inclusive processes (Section 3.6.1.2.1) that engage diverse stakeholders (Basel et al., 2020; McNamara et al., 2020; Ogier et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2020) and protect Indigenous customary rights (Farbotko and McMichael, 2019; Ford et al., 2020), empower women and give rights to climate refugees (McLeod et al., 2018).
