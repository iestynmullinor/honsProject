Ocean governance has become increasingly complex as new initiatives, new international agreements, institutions and scientific evidence arise at global, national and subnational scales (high agreement ) (Bindoff et al., 2019a; Scobie, 2019b), limiting the present effectiveness of adaptation (IPCC, 2019c). Marine climate governance is within the normatively contested marine governance space (Fraz√£o Santos et al., 2020), which is influenced by geopolitics (Gray et al., 2020) and profit maximisation (Flannery et al., 2016; Haas et al., 2021) in ways that can entrench exclusionary processes in decision making, science management and funding (Levin et al., 2018). This limits just and inclusive ocean governance (Bennett, 2018), perpetuates historical and cultural extractive practices and climate inaction, and leaves little space for Indigenous-led adaptation frameworks and approaches (Nursey-Bray et al., 2019). At the national level, ocean governance for climate-change adaptation is often transversal, requiring consideration of biophysical and environmental conditions (Furlan et al., 2020) while fitting into existing economic (Kim, 2020) and political processes. Adaptation governance that couples existing top-down structures with decentralised and participatory approaches generates shared goals and unlocks required resources and monitoring (Gupta et al., 2016; Haas et al., 2021).Communities and governments at all levels increasingly use decision-making frameworks (e.g., structured decision making) or decision-analysis tools to evaluate trade-offs between different responses, rather than applying generic best practices to different physical, technical or cultural contexts (high confidence) (Watkiss et al., 2015; Haasnoot et al., 2019; Palutikof et al., 2019). Increased effort has also been devoted to developing climate services (actionable information and data products) that bridge the gap between climate prediction and decision making (Hewitt et al., 2020). Climate services have the potential to inform decision making related to disaster-risk reduction, adaptation responses, marine environmental management (e.g., fisheries management and MPA management) and ocean-based climate mitigation (e.g., renewable-energy installations) (Le Cozannet et al., 2017; Gattuso et al., 2019; Gattuso et al., 2021). Although improving observational and modelling capacity is important to developing ocean-focused services, particularly in high-risk regions like SIDS where regional climate projections are scarce (WGI AR6 Chapter 9; Morim et al., 2019; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021), data are not the only limiting factor in decision making (Weichselgartner and Arheimer, 2019). Focusing on user engagement, relationship building and the decision-making context ensures that climate services are useful to, and used by, different stakeholders (high confidence) (Soares et al., 2018; Mackenzie et al., 2019; Weichselgartner and Arheimer, 2019; Findlater et al., 2021; West et al., 2021).
