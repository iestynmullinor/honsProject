Finance is a key barrier globally for ocean health, governance and adaptation to climate change (high agreement ) (Annex II: Glossary; Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17; Hinkel et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2018; Wabnitz and Blasiak, 2019; Woodruff et al., 2020; Sumaila et al., 2021). Global adaptation finance was estimated to total 30 billion USD yr –1 in 2017–2018, or 5% of all climate finance (CPI, 2019), with no tracking specifically for coastal or marine adaptation in low- to middle-income countries. Marine-focused adaptation finance is difficult to trace and label due to the cross-sectoral nature of many projects (Blasiak and Wabnitz, 2018) and the lack of clear definitions about what qualifies as adaptation or as new and additional finance (Donner et al., 2016; Weikmans and Roberts, 2019). Finance for marine conservation from Overseas Development Assistance doubled between 2003 and 2016, reaching 634 million USD in 2016, similar to the level provided by philanthropic foundations (Berger et al., 2019). Yet coastal adaptation to SLR alone is projected to cost hundreds of billions of USD yr –1, depending on the model and emission scenario (e.g., Wong et al., 2014; Nicholls et al., 2019). Economic and financing barriers to marine adaptation are often higher in low- to middle-income countries, where resources influence governance and constrain options for implementation and maintenance (high confidence) (Hinkel et al., 2018; Klöck and Nunn, 2019; Tompkins et al., 2020), and impacts on their coastal and marine ecosystems could total several percentage points of their gross domestic product (Wong et al., 2014). Current financial flows are insufficient to meet the costs of coastal and marine impacts of climate change (very high confidence) and ocean-focused finance is unevenly distributed, with higher flows within, and to, developed countries (very high confidence).Development assistance can help resolve resource constraints, but additional governance and coordination challenges can arise from short-term, project-based funding, shifting the priorities of donor institutions and the pressures placed on human resources in the receiving nation (Parsons and Nalau, 2019; Nunn et al., 2020). Innovative policy instruments, such as concessional loans, tax-policy reforms, climate bonds and public-debt forgiveness, can supplement traditional financial instruments (Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018; McGowan et al., 2020). Mechanisms for solving the persistent problem of securing upfront investments for coastal protection and other adaptation measures (Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018; Moser et al., 2019; Kok et al., 2021) include integrating adaptation investments into insurance schemes (Reguero et al., 2020) and using debt financing to bridge the time until benefits are realised (Ware and Banhalmi-Zakar, 2020). Insurance mechanisms that link payments to losses from a trigger event (e.g., MHW) can confer resilience to marine-dependent communities (Sumaila et al., 2021). All innovative financial instruments are most effective when they are inclusive and reach vulnerable groups and marginalised communities (low evidence, high agreement ) (Claudet et al., 2020a; Sumaila et al., 2021).Countries with large ocean areas within their EEZs have opportunities to develop ‘blue–green economies’ to reduce emissions and finance adaptation pathways (Chen et al., 2018a; Lee et al., 2020). Shifting from grants to results-based financing can help attract more private capital to ocean adaptation (Lubchenco et al., 2016; Claudet et al., 2020a). Public–private partnerships can also increase ocean adaptation finance (Goldstein et al., 2019; Sumaila et al., 2021). For example, the financial benefits that biodiversity conservation confers to seafood harvest resilience could be used to leverage industry participation in adaptation and conservation finance (Barbier et al., 2018). Connecting restoration of blue carbon ecosystems with offset markets (e.g., Vanderklift et al., 2019) shows potential, but uncertainties remain about the international emissions trading under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and climate impacts on blue carbon ecosystems (Section 3.6.3.1.6; Lovelock et al., 2017a; Macreadie et al., 2019).Transparency, coherence between different actors and initiatives, and project monitoring and evaluation enhance success in adapting and achieving SDG14 (Life Below Water) (Blasiak et al., 2019). Maladaptation (WGII Chapter 16; Magnan et al., 2016) is a common risk of current project-based funding due to the pressure to produce concrete results (medium confidence) (Parsons and Nalau, 2019; Nunn et al., 2020; Nunn et al., 2021). Maladaptation can be avoided through a focus on building adaptive capacity, community-based management, drivers of vulnerability and site-specific measures (low confidence) (Magnan and Duvat, 2018; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2020; Schipper, 2020). More research is needed to identify ways that governance and financing agreements can help overcome financial barriers and sociocultural constraints to avoid maladaptation in coastal ecosystems (high confidence) (Hinkel et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2018; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2020; Schipper, 2020).
