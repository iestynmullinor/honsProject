Restoration of degraded ecosystems is a common NbS increasingly deployed at local scales in response to climate change (Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2; Duarte et al., 2020; Bertolini and da Mosto, 2021; Braun de Torrez et al., 2021). Despite covering limited areas and having uncertain efficacy under future climate change (Gordon et al., 2020), these actions have successfully restored marine populations and ecosystems at regional to global scales (Duarte et al., 2020), and enhanced livelihoods and the well-being of coastal peoples as well as the biodiversity and resilience of ecological communities (Silver et al., 2019; Gordon et al., 2020; Braun de Torrez et al., 2021). Technology-based approaches, such as active restoration, assisted evolution and ecological forecasting, can aid in moving beyond restoring ecosystems (Section 3.6.2.3) towards enhancing resilience, reviving biodiversity and guarding against loss of foundational, ornamental or iconic species (Bulleri et al., 2018; Collins et al., 2019a; da Silva et al., 2019; National Academies of Sciences, 2019; Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020; Fredriksen et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020c; Kleypas et al., 2021).Local restoration projects often target vegetated ecosystems like mangroves, seagrasses and salt marshes that are valued and used by coastal communities (Veettil et al., 2019; Duarte et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020a; Bertolini and da Mosto, 2021). Detail on mangroves and corals as EbA and protection/restoration hotspots is provided in SM3.8. Common and effective actions (Sasmito et al., 2019; Duarte et al., 2020; Oreska et al., 2020) include securing accommodation space (Sections 3.4.2.4–3.4.2.5), restoring hydrological (Kroeger et al., 2017; Al-Haj and Fulweiler, 2020) and sediment dynamics; managing harvesting (particularly in mangroves); reducing pollution (especially in seagrasses) (de los Santos et al., 2019); and replanting appropriate species in suitable environmental settings (Wodehouse and Rayment, 2019; Friess et al., 2020a). Although efficacy is context dependent (Zeng et al., 2020; Krause-Jensen et al., 2021) and implementation is most often local (Alongi, 2018a), such projects facilitate tangible community engagement in climate action. Moreover, because these ecosystems sequester disproportionate amounts of carbon (blue carbon) (Annex II: Glossary; see Box 3.4), restoration supports climate-change mitigation (Lovelock and Reef, 2020; Gattuso et al., 2021). Yet, constraints remain. For instance, Southeast Asia has 1.21 million km 2 of terrestrial, freshwater and mangrove area biophysically suitable for reforestation, which could mitigate 3.43 ± 1.29 Pg CO2 e yr −1 through 2030; however, reforestation is only feasible in a small fraction of this area (0.3–18%) given financial, land-use and operational constraints (Zeng et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the multiple benefits offered by ecosystem restoration will likely  outweigh competing costs and increase its relevance as part of adaptation-strategy portfolios (Silver et al., 2019; Wedding et al., 2021), national carbon-accounting systems and nationally determined contributions by parties to the Paris Agreement (Friess et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 2020a).Restoration efficacy of coral reefs, kelp forests and other habitat-forming coastal ecosystems (Sections 3.4.2.2–3.4.2.6) are jeopardised by the near-term nature of climate-driven risks (McLeod et al., 2019; National Academies of Sciences, 2019; Coleman et al., 2020b). Modelling studies indicate that available practices will not prevent degradation of coral reefs from >1.5°C of global average surface warming (Figure 3.25; National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine, 2019; Condie et al., 2021; Hafezi et al., 2021). Proposed interventions include assisted migration (Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020; Fredriksen et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020c), assisted evolution (Bay et al., 2019; National Academies of Sciences, 2019) and other engineering solutions like artificial shading and enhanced upwelling (Condie et al., 2021; Kleypas et al., 2021).Figure 3.25 | Implemented and potential future adaptations in ocean and coastal ecosystems.

(Underlying data are available in Tables SM3.4–3.6.)Open figure Transplanting heat-tolerant coral colonies can increase reef resistance to bleaching (Morikawa and Palumbi, 2019; Howells et al., 2021) but potentially lower species diversity and alter ecosystem function (Section 3.4.2.1). Genetic manipulation or assisted evolution that propagates genes from heat-tolerant populations could enhance restoration of corals (Anthony et al., 2017; Epstein et al., 2019) and kelp (medium agreement, limited evidence) (Coleman and Goold, 2019; Coleman et al., 2020b; Fredriksen et al., 2020; Wade et al., 2020). Managed breeding of corals has also had limited success in the laboratory and at small local scales (National Academies of Sciences, 2019). There is also limited evidence that physiological interventions, such as algal-symbiont or microbiome manipulation, could increase coral thermal tolerance in the field (National Academies of Sciences, 2019). Employing the natural adaptive capacity of species or individuals in active restoration for corals and kelps with current technology involves fewer risks than assisted evolution or long-distance relocation (high confidence) (Filbee-Dexter and Smajdor, 2019; National Academies of Sciences, 2019). More ambitious engineered interventions like reef shading remain theoretical and not scalable to the reef level (Condie et al., 2021). Debate continues on how to apply planned adaptation in cost-effective ways that will accomplish the intended goals (National Academies of Sciences, 2019; Duarte et al., 2020; Kleypas et al., 2021).Models show that a combination of available management approaches (restoration, reducing non-climate drivers) and speculative interventions (e.g., enhanced corals, reef shading) can contribute to sustaining some coral reefs beyond 1.5°C of global warming with declining effectiveness beyond 2°C of global warming (medium confidence) (Figure 3.25; WGII Chapter 17). These proposed interventions are also currently theoretical and impractical over large scales; for example, engineered solutions like reef shading are untested and not scalable at the reef level (Condie et al., 2021). Existing projects suggest that restoration and ecological interventions to habitat-forming ecosystems have the additional benefits of raising local awareness, promoting tourism, and creating jobs and economic benefits (Fadli et al., 2012; Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020; Hafezi et al., 2021), provided communities are involved in planning, operation and monitoring (Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020).
