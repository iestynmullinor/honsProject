Human adaptation comprises an array of measures (adaptation options; IPCC, 2014a) that modulate harm or exploit opportunities from climate change (Section 1.2.1.3). Adaptation options that respond to key ocean and coastal risks (Section 3.4) focus on individuals, livelihoods and economic sectors that benefit from ocean and coastal ecosystem services (Section 3.5). AR5 concluded that local adaptation measures would not alone be enough to offset global effects of increased climate change on marine and coastal ecosystems, and that mitigation of emissions would also be necessary (high confidence) (Table 3.27; Pörtner et al., 2014; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). SROCC assessed that ecosystem-based adaptation, including MPAs (high confidence) (Bindoff et al., 2019a) and adaptive management, are effective to reduce climate-change impacts (IPCC, 2018; IPCC, 2019b), but that existing marine governance is insufficient to provide an effective adaptation response in the marine ecosystem (high confidence) (IPCC, 2019c).Table 3.27 | Conclusions from previous IPCC assessments about implemented adaptation, enablers and limits, and contribution to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)AR5SR15SROCCDegree of implementation (Section 3.6.3.1)‘The analysis and implementation of coastal adaptation towards climate-resilient and sustainable coasts has progressed moresignificantly in developed countries than in developing countries (high confidenc e)’(Wong et al., 2014).‘Adaptation (to SLR) isalready happening (high confidence) and will remain important overmulti-centennial time scales’(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a).‘A diversity of adaptation responses to coastal impacts and risks have been implemented around the world, but mostly as a reaction to current coastal risk or experienced disasters (high confidence)’(Oppenheimer et al., 2019).Conservation and restoration(Section 3.6.3.2)‘With continuing climate change, local adaptation measures (such as conservation) or a reduction in human activities (such asfishing) may not sufficiently offset global-scale effects on marine ecosystems (high confidence)’(Pörtner et al., 2014).‘Existing and restored natural coastal ecosystems may be effective in reducing the adverse impacts of rising sea levels and intensifying storms by protecting coastal and deltaic regions (medium confidence)’(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a).‘Ecosystem restoration may be able to locally reduce climate risks (medium confidence) but at relatively high cost and effectiveness limited to low-emissions scenarios and to less-sensitive ecosystems (high confidence)’(Bindoff et al., 2019a).Enablers, barriers and limits of adaptation (Section 3.6.3.3)‘Adaptation strategies for ocean regions beyond coastal waters are generally poorly developed but will benefit from international legislation and expert networks, as well as marine spatial planning (high agreement )’(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014).‘Lower rates of change [associated with a 1.5°C temperature increase] enhance the ability of natural and human systems to adapt, with substantial benefits for a wide range of terrestrial, freshwater, wetland, coastal and ocean ecosystems (including coral reefs) (high confidence)’(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018a).‘There are a broad range of identified barriers and limitsfor adaptation to climate change in ecosystems and human systems (high confidence). Limitations include [...] availability of technology, knowledge and financial support, and existing governance structures (medium confidence)(Bindoff et al., 2019a).Existing ocean-governance structures are already facing multi-dimensional, scale-related challenges because of climate change [...] (high confidence)’(Bindoff et al., 2019a).SDGs and other policy frameworks (Section 3.6.4)‘Overall, there is a strong need to develop ecosystem-based monitoring and adaptation strategies to mitigate rapidly growing risks and uncertainties to the coastal and oceanic industries, communities and nations (high agreement )’(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014).‘Adaptation strategies can result in trade-offs with and among the SDGs (medium evidence, high agreement )’(Roy et al., 2018).‘Achieving [the SDGs] and charting Climate Resilient Development Pathways depends in part on ambitious and sustained mitigation efforts to contain SLR coupled with effective adaptation actions to reduce SLR impacts and risk (medium evidence, high agreement )’(Oppenheimer et al., 2019).This section builds on the SROCC assessment of the portfolio of available solutions, their applicability and their effectiveness in reducing climate-change-induced risks to ocean and coastal ecosystems. Section 3.6.2 assesses the set of planned adaptation measures. Section 3.6.3 assesses implementation of adaptation solutions and the enablers, barriers and limitations that affect their feasibility. Section 3.6.4 evaluates the contribution of planned adaptation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other policy-relevant frameworks, and Section 3.6.5  synthesises emerging evidence about best practices.
