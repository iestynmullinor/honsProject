Engineering and technology support marine and coastal adaptation (Table 3.29). Built infrastructure includes engineered solutions that protect, accommodate or relocate coastal assets using hard engineering, like seawalls, and soft engineering, such as beach and shore nourishment (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3). Technological tools include early-warning systems for extreme events (Bindoff et al., 2019a; Collins et al., 2019a), improved forecast and hindcast models (Winter et al., 2020; Davidson et al., 2021; Spillman and Smith, 2021) and environmental monitoring (Claudet et al., 2020a; Wilson et al., 2020a; Melbourne-Thomas et al., 2021) that support informed decision making (Tommasi et al., 2017; Rilov et al., 2020; A. Maureaud et al., 2021). Emerging adaptation technologies, such as habitat development, active restoration and assisted evolution (Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020; Kleypas et al., 2021), intend to accelerate recovery of damaged ecosystems and promote ecological adaptation to climate change (Jones et al., 2018a; Boström-Einarsson et al., 2020; Kleypas et al., 2021).Table 3.29 | Assessment of built infrastructure and technology solutions to reduce mid-term climate impacts in oceans and coastal ecosystems aSolutionConfidence in solution (mid-term potential)Contribution to adaptationSelected referencesExamples of implementationAccommodation and relocationHigh confidenceAsset modification and relocation of livelihoods to adapt to sea level rise, extreme events and coastal erosion.Hanson and Nicholls (2020); Monios and Wilmsmeier (2020); Zickgraf (2021)Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3, coastal development (Section 3.6.3.1.1)Protection and beach and shore nourishmentMedium confidenceProtection of coastal ecosystems with interventions, such as beach and shore nourishment, is a common response to beach erosion around the world, and an alternative to hard protection structures such as seawalls.Pinto et al.
