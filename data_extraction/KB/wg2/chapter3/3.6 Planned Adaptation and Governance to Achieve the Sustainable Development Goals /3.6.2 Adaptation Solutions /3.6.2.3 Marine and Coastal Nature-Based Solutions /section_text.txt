The ocean and coastal adaptation portfolio (Figure 3.23) also includes marine and coastal NbS (Table 3.30). NbS that contribute to climate adaptation, also known as ecosystem-based adaptations (EBA), are cross-cutting actions that harness ecosystem functions to restore, protect and sustainably manage marine ecosystems facing climate-change impacts, while also benefiting social systems and human security (Abelson et al., 2015; Barkdull and Harris, 2019) and supporting biodiversity (high confidence) (Annex II: Glossary; Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2; Seddon et al., 2021). NbS are expected to contribute to global adaptation and mitigation goals (high confidence) (Beck et al., 2018; Cooley et al., 2019; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019b; Men√©ndez et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020a) by protecting coastal environments from SLR and storms (Cross-Chapter Box SLR; Reguero et al., 2018), and by storing substantial quantities of carbon (Sections 3.4.2.5, 3.6.3.1.5; WGIII AR6 Chapter 7; Howard et al., 2017; Chow, 2018; Smale et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2019b; Soper et al., 2019). Marine NbS are cost-effective, can generate social, economic and cultural co-benefits, and can contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the near- to mid-term (high confidence) (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, 2009; Gattuso et al., 2018; Barkdull and Harris, 2019; McLeod et al., 2019).
