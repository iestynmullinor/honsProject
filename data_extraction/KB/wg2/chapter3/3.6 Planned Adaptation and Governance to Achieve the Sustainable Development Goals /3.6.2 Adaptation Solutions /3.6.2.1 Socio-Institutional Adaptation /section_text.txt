Increasing evidence shows that an effective solution portfolio includes social and institutional adaptation (Figure 3.23, top; Table 3.28). Social adaptation to climate change is already occurring, as people use strategies ranging from accommodating change, to coping, adapting and transforming their livelihoods (Béné and Doyen, 2018; Fedele et al., 2019; Galappaththi et al., 2019; Barnes et al., 2020; Ojea et al., 2020; Green et al., 2021c). Although management and institutions have major roles in adaptation (Gaines et al., 2018; Barange, 2019), marine governance is impeded by increasing numbers of often-competing users and uses (Boyes and Elliott, 2014); sector-led, fragmented efforts (Nunan et al., 2020); and a legal framework less clear than those on land (Crespo et al., 2019; Guggisberg, 2019). Future social responses depend on warming levels and on the institutional, socioeconomic and cultural constructs that allow or limit livelihood changes (medium confidence) (Chapter 18; Galappaththi et al., 2019; Ford et al., 2020; Green et al., 2021c). Both social and institutional transformations are needed to change the structures of power, culture, politics and/or identity associated with marine ecosystems (Section 1.5.2; Wilson et al., 2020b). Ideally, institutional and social adaptation will work together to sustain knowledge systems and education, enhance participation and social inclusion, facilitate livelihood support and transformational change of dependent coastal communities, provide economic and financial instruments, and include polycentric and multi-level governance of transboundary management (Fedele et al., 2019; Fulton et al., 2019).Table 3.28 | Assessment of socio-institutional adaptation solutions to reduce mid-term climate impacts in oceans and coastal ecosystems aSolutionConfidence in solution (mid-term potential)Contribution to adaptationSelected referencesExamples of implementationKnowledge diversityHigh confidenceConsideration of IK and LK systems is beneficial to communities, increases their resilience and is relevant and transferable beyond the local scale.Norström et al.

Migration could be considered an adaptation solution for some coastal and island populations in the cases of extreme events, but also as a response to more gradual changes (e.g., coastal erosion from sea level rise).Maharjan et al.
