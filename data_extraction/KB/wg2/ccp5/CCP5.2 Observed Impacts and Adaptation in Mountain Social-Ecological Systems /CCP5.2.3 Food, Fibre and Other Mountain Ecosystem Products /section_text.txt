There is high confidence that climate change is largely negatively impacting food, fibre and other ecosystem products, including agriculture (Porter et al., 2014; Ingxay et al., 2015; Upgupta et al., 2015; Chirwa et al., 2017; Rojas-Downing et al., 2017; Chitale et al., 2018; Pretzsch et al., 2018; Barberán et al., 2019; Sultan et al., 2019; Huang and Hao, 2020; Godde et al., 2021), and ecosystem services (Grêt-Regamey and Weibel, 2020) across many different mountainous regions, for example in Africa (Bondé et al., 2019; Musakwa et al., 2020), Asia (Guo et al., 2018; Sunderland and Vasquez, 2020), Europe (Nair, 2019), North America (Hupp et al., 2015; Prevéy et al., 2020) and South America (Herman-Mercer et al., 2020) (Sections 5.4, 5.4.1, 5.5.1, 5.6.2, 5.7, 5.11.1.1).Ecosystem products are vital to support the livelihoods and economic prospects for communities living in and around mountains (Figure CCP5.3). For instance, collection and trade of caterpillar fungus contributed to 53.3–64.5% annual household cash income in Nepal (Shrestha and Bawa, 2014; Shrestha et al., 2019); 40–80% in Bhutan (Thapa et al., 2018) and 60–78% in Uttarakhand, India (Laha et al., 2018; Yadav et al., 2019) (Section 5.7.1). Livelihood support from ecosystem products in southern Malawi (Pullanikkatil et al., 2020), southwestern Ethiopian mountains (Nischalke et al., 2017), Southern China (Min et al., 2017), Himalayan mountains (Nepal et al., 2018) and South Africa (Ngwenya et al., 2019) has been reported. Additionally, the sacredness of mountains in different religions and cultures is widely acknowledged (Ceruti, 2019; Benedetti et al., 2021).Figure CCP5.3 | Impact of climate change on mountain social-ecological systems, including ecosystem services and products, livelihoods of mountain people and examples of adaptation options to address direct and indirect impacts. Open figure Climate change and its associated impacts on multiple ecosystem services and related products (timber production, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and protection against natural hazards) have been observed across European mountains, for example in the central Iberian Mountains (Spain), Western and Eastern Alps (France, Austria) and Dinaric Mountains (Slovenia) (Mina et al., 2017). Dumont et al. (2015) demonstrated that climate change negatively affects forage nitrogen (N) content by 8% but increases total non-structural carbohydrate content by 25% in European mountains. Positive impacts have been reported on mushroom productivity in the mountains of Spain (Karavani et al., 2018) (Section 5.7.3.3), yet negative impacts have been reported on the Ophiocordyceps in the Himalayan region (Hopping et al., 2018), as well as on apple production in Himachal Pradesh, India, which declined by 9.4 t per hectare in the past two decades (Das, 2021). Shifts in the richness of crop wild relatives from south to north and an increase in the numbers of threatened taxa with an increase of 1.5°C and 3°C temperature rise have been observed in European mountains (Phillips et al., 2017).Medicinal and aromatic plants and their secondary metabolites are also observed to be affected by climate change (medium confidence) (Das et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019a). Phenological changes like early flowering and reduced vegetative phase are negatively affecting the productivity of such plants (Harish et al., 2012; Gaira et al., 2014; Maikhuri et al., 2018). While increasing atmospheric temperature and CO2 are reported to improve the biomass of Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Chang et al., 2016) (Section 5.7.3.3), they adversely affect its antioxidant compounds/activity, health-promoting properties and phytochemical content (Gairola et al., 2010; Das et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2020). Experimental trials have shown that when medicinal plants are stressed by drought, phytochemical content increases, either by a decrease in biomass or by an increase in the actual production of metabolites (medium confidence) (Selmar and Kleinwächter, 2013; Al-Gabbiesh et al., 2015). The strong effects of climatic and non-climatic factors have been observed to affect the distribution of selected medicinal plant species in northern Thailand (Tangjitman et al., 2015), as well as in Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, Spain, Central Himalaya, China and Nepal, with some species at risk of extinction (Munt et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2017; Brunette et al., 2018; Chitale et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Applequist et al., 2020). Negative climate-related impacts on the distribution range of 41 medicinal plant species have been predicted for Spanish and Asian mountains (Munt et al., 2016) (Section 5.7.3.3), as has a decreasing size of fruits of Myrica esculenta in the Himalaya (Shah and Tewari, 2016).
