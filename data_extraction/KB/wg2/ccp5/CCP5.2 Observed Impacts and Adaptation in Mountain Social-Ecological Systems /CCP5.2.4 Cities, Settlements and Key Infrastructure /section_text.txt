Mountain settlements and people are globally distributed and represent a significant proportion of the total global population that is exposed to the effects of climate change (Section CCP5.1, SMCCP5.1). Cities with one or several million inhabitants located in mountainous environments or at high elevations are predominantly found in Latin America (e.g., El Alto and La Paz, Bolivia; Quito, Ecuador; Mexico City, Mexico; and Bogota, Colombia), Asia (e.g., Kabul, Afghanistan; Kathmandu, Nepal; Srinagar and Dehradun, India; Peshawar and Quetta, Pakistan; and Xining and Kunming, China) and Africa (e.g., Harare, Zimbabwe; and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia) (Wang and Lu, 2018; Balderas Torres et al., 2021; Ehrlich et al., 2021). Mountain regions are also host to many settlements with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants (Alfthan et al., 2016). In many cases, particularly in developing countries, portions of the population also reside in informal and low-income settlements (French et al., 2021), where rates of poverty and inequality exacerbate peopleâ€™s vulnerability and exposure to climate-related hazards such as landslides (Alfthan et al. 2018) (Section CCP5.2.5.1), environmental pollution or even pandemic diseases (Marazziti et al., 2021).In many mountain regions, particularly in developing countries, the increasing urban population has put considerable pressure on water services and basic amenities for urban dwellers (Singh et al., 2021), for example in cities such as La Paz (Kinouchi et al., 2019), which are regions already under pressure due to the negative effects of climate change, coupled with poor water availability and governance (Chapter 4; CCP5.2.2.1; FAQ CCP5.1; Hock et al. 2019). In many areas of the HKH region, water demand far exceeds municipal supply, and people cope with water insecurity in a variety of ways (Bharti et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2020), such as by resorting to interbasin water transfers and deep pumping, to supply their water needs (Ojha et al., 2020). Additionally, influxes of migrants, tourists and retirees, combined with the growth of the incumbent population, place considerable stress on urban infrastructures that must supply adequate clean water and provide for sewage disposal (Prakash and Molden, 2020), which is also observable in other regions (Chapter 4; Section 6.4.7; Case Study 6.1 in Chapter 6). Energy provision in and around mountain settlements is another key sector affected by climate-related impacts (Hock et al., 2019; CCP5.2.2.2), which bears relevance for the adaptation prospects for urban mountain settlements (medium confidence).
