The risk of intangible losses and loss of cultural values is associated with the decline of ice and snow cover and temperature increase, as well as the increase in intangible harm from hazards such as floods and droughts (high agreement, medium evidence) (Diemberger et al., 2015; Jurt et al., 2015; Vuille et al., 2018; Tschakert et al., 2019; Vander Naald, 2020). Losses are intangible because they characterise aspects which are difficult to quantify, i.e., loss of identity, loss of self-reliance, loss of rituals and traditions and place attachment (Allison, 2015; Baul and McDonald, 2015; Motschmann et al., 2020a; Schneiderbauer et al., 2021). A global systematic analysis of case studies shows that this risk is more prevalent in the Andes, the Himalaya and the Alps (Tschakert et al., 2019). Often mentioned across studies is the loss of intrinsic memories and culture related to changes in world heritage landscapes and iconic sites (Jurt et al., 2015; Sherry et al., 2018; Bosson et al., 2019). Changes in hazard landscapes are also reported to contribute to the loss of peace of mind and loss of well-being (Diemberger et al., 2015). Overall, there is limited evidence but medium agreement  that the risk of intangible losses and the loss of cultural identity will rapidly increase and that consequences will go from reversible damage to irreversible losses (Tschakert et al., 2019).
