Since AR5, many cities and other settlements, particularly unplanned and/or informal in Asia and Africa, have continued to grow at rapid rates (van den Berg , Otto and Fikresilassie 2021). Elsewhere, in Latin America in particular, while growth is less rapid, inequality persists. As a result, cities and settlements are crucial both as sites of potential action on climate change, and sites of increased exposure to risk (medium evidence, high agreement ). Patterns and trends for urban population growth were described in detail in AR5. Between 2015 and 2020, urban populations globally have grown by more than 397 million people, with more than 90% of this growth taking place in less developed regions (UNDESA, 2018). The latest population projections from UNDESA (2018) reinforce the trends identified previously, with even higher estimates for global urban populations. The 2012 data used in AR5 projected a global urban population of 4984 million in 2030 and 6252 million in 2050; the 2018 revisions project 5167 million and 6680 million respectively. Particularly noteworthy is the higher projection provided for sub-Saharan Africa’s urban population: increasing from 596 million to 666 million in 2030, and from 1069 million to 1258 million in 2050. These figures highlight the continued trend toward larger urban populations, and the particular significance of this in areas which currently have relatively small proportions of their populations living in towns and cities; this is also true in some Small Island States (e.g., the Solomon Islands) (McEvoy  et al., 2020). The proportion of the global urban population living in megacities (with populations of more than 10 million people) is expected to continue growing slowly (to 16% of the urban total, or 862 million people, living in 48 agglomerations) by 2035 (UNDESA, 2018). The size and form of these megacities presents particular challenges with climate change impacts, in areas including air quality (Baklanov, Luisa and Molina, 2016), flooding (Januriyadi  et al., 2018), and temperature increase (Darmanto  et al., 2019) (see Section 6.2.3).While there are few analyses of urban trends at the global scale, an additional 2.5 billion people are projected to be living in urban areas by 2050, with up to 90% of this increase concentrated in the regions of Asia and Africa, particularly in India, China and Nigeria, where 35% of this urban growth is projected to occur (UNDESA, 2018). Growth rates are slowing down in North America, South America and Europe (UNDESA, 2018). Much global growth continues to outstrip the ability of governments or the private sector to plan, fund and provide for sustainable urban infrastructure and this is most marked in low-income and informal settlements (Angel  et al., 2016). Rural migration as a driver of urbanisation is discussed in 6.2.4.3, and literature has documented the way urban expansion and the conversion of agricultural land is also driven by investment incentives and weak planning policies (Colsaet, Laurans and Levrel, 2018; Woodworth and Wallace, 2017). At the same time, early evidence suggests that, at least in some locations, out-migration from cities occurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (Rajan, Sivakumar and Srinivasan, 2020), but the evidence is not clear and in some cases may have increased migration to other megacities (Chow  et al., 2021). There is also growing recognition that poor planning has exacerbated the concentrated of deprivation in specific locations, deepening a cycle of exclusion and marginalisation (UNDESA, 2020).One critical element of global urban trends which has received growing attention is informality (see also Prieur-Richard, Walsh and Craig, 2019). Informality is one of the key defining features of cities and settlements in the Global South (see Annex II: Glossary; Banks, Lombard and Mitlin, 2020; Myers, 2021; UN-Habitat, 2016c). In almost all nations in the Global South, more than half the urban workforce work in informal employment; the proportions are particularly high in South Asia (82% in informal employment) and sub-Saharan Africa (66%) (Chen, Roever and Skinner, 2016; Chen, 2014). The term ‘informal settlement’ refers to urban settlements or neighbourhoods that developed outside the formal system that is meant to record land ownership and tenure and without meeting a range of regulations relating to planning and land use, built structures and health and safety. Informality is a broader concept than ‘slums’, which are usually defined using measures of housing quality, provision of services and overcrowding. While most countries do not generate formal statistics on the number of people living in informal settlements, UN Habitat provides regional and global estimates of the number of urban households that are ‘slum’ households and therefore likely to include most residents of informal settlements. These estimates suggest that there were 1034 million slum dwellers in 2018, including some 56% of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa and more than 30% of the urban population of South Asia (UN-Habitat, 2020). Informality is particularly important in understanding climate risks and responses in cities and settlements, and also in relation to key infrastructure (Trundle, 2020; Taylor  et al., 2021).Evidence since AR5 confirms that occupants of informal settlements are particularly exposed to climate events given low-quality housing, limited capacity to adapt, and limited or no risk-reducing infrastructure (high confidence) (Melore and Nel, 2020; Twinomuhangi  et al., 2021; Satterthwaite  et al., 2020; Patel  et al., 2020a)(see Section 6.2 and case study). The impacts of COVID-19 are also increasingly impacting high-density informal and slum settlements where social distancing and access to water for handwashing are limited (Bhide, 2020; Pinchoff  et al., 2021; Tagliacozzo, Pisacane and Kilkey, 2021; Wilkinson, 2020). This compounds pre-existing vulnerability to climate change associated hazards. Box 6.1 expands on trends in informality as part of global urbanism, peri-urbanisation and suburbanisation, with implications for the global distribution of climate risks and adaptive capacity.Adaptation and related concepts of urban climate resilience are also concerns for the broader agenda of sustainable development (Wachsmuth, Cohen and Angelo, 2016). Urban areas can play a positive role in advancing sustainability, but the pace and scale of urban development can also undermine progress in SDGs (Barnett and Parnell, 2016; Maes  et al., 2019; Anarfi, Hill and Shiel, 2020) (high confidence). With careful planning, urbanisation can be a transformative force, enhancing equity and well-being through co-benefits and synergies between climate change adaptation, equitable urban development and mitigation (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Parnell, 2016a; Solecki  et al., 2015; Sharifi, 2020). Cities can be effective change agents when supported by networked local and national institutions, including professional bodies (high confidence) (Andonova, Hale and Roger, 2017; Brandtner and Suárez, 2021; Heidrich  et al., 2016; Kern, 2019; Farzaneh and Wang, 2020). Low Emission Development Strategies (LEDS) have developed effective science–policy interactions to support energy-system, environmental and economic development planning strategies in the city of Shanghai, China (Farzaneh and Wang, 2020). New literature is emerging about how adaptive changes at the urban level could integrate both far reaching rapid emission reduction and community protection in transformative ways (Wamsler and Raggers, 2018; Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2018; UN-Habitat, 2020; Ziervogel, 2019a). There is an increasing consensus about the need for integrated governance of urban areas within and across regions, so that urban risk management and adaptation happen hand in hand with more general processes of transition toward more sustainable urban regions (Simon, 2016; UN-Habitat, 2020).Since AR5, there has also been increasing recognition of the contribution of diverse knowledges including local and Indigenous knowledge in contributing to the development and interpretation of urban relevant climate change data and policy for effective action (Klenk  et al., 2017; Hosen, Nakamura and Hamzah, 2020; Makondo and Thomas, 2018). Indigenous and local knowledge inform coping strategies in urban adaptation planning and new directions for action (Nakashima, Krupnik and Rubis, 2018; Abudu Kasei, Dalitso Kalanda-Joshua and Tutu Benefor, 2019). Indigenous and local knowledge is also found to shape perceptions about urban climate risk awareness, its acceptable limits, causation and preferences for adaptation (see also Pyhälä et al., 2016 for a review; see Jaakkola, Juntunen and Näkkäläjärvi, 2018 for impacts on Indigenous peoples in the EU; Saboohi  et al., 2019). Local perceptions about climate change in turn influence adaptation behaviours in settlements and urban communities (Lee  et al., 2015; Larcom, She and van Gevelt, 2019). Engagement with Indigenous and local knowledge is an enabling condition for planning community-appropriate climate adaptation responses (Fernández-Llamazares  et al., 2015). Urban decision making that includes Indigenous and local knowledge has co-benefits for addressing indigenous dispossession, historical inequities and marginalisation of indigenous values that occurred (Parsons  et al., 2019; Carter, 2019; Maldonado  et al., 2016; Orlove  et al., 2014; Pearce  et al., 2015). Indigenous and local knowledge can help deliver culturally appropriate strategies and local choices for urban risk management through, for example community-based observation networks (Alessa  et al., 2016), integrating ecosystem-based adaptation strategies in institutional structures (Nalau  et al., 2018), using multiple evidence-based approaches (Tengö et al., 2014), and adopting forms of governance that centre Indigenous peoples in urban adaptation and decision making (Horn, 2018; Parsons, Fisher and Nalau, 2016).
