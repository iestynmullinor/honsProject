Apart from land subsidence from urbanisation (e.g., Case Study 6.2), substantial climate risks to urban sanitation arise from droughts, flooding and storm surges. Low flows from drought can lead to sedimentation, increase pollutant concentration and block sewer infrastructure networks (Campos and Darch, 2015). Flooding poses a greater risk for urban sanitation in low- and middle-income settings (Burgin  et al., 2019) where onsite systems are more common. Floodwater may wash out pits and tanks, mobilising faecal sludges and other hazardous materials leading to both direct and indirect exposure via food and contaminated objects and surfaces, and pollute streams and waterbodies (Howard  et al., 2016; Braks and de Roda Husman, 2013; Bornemann  et al., 2019). Floods also damage infrastructure; toilets, pits, tanks and treatment systems are all vulnerable (Sherpa  et al., 2014; UNICEF and WHO 2019).Sanitation systems coupled with floodwater management are at risk of damage and capacity exceedance from high rainfall (Thakali, Kalra and Ahmad, 2016; Kirshen  et al., 2015; Dong, Guo and Zeng, 2017). In England, the number of water and wastewater treatment plants at risk of flooding is projected to increase by 33% under a 4oC scenario (Sayers  et al., 2015), but risks are generally increasing for both formal and informal urban sanitation systems (Howard  et al., 2016).
