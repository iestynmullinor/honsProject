Healthcare facilities (hospitals, clinics, residential homes) will suffer increasing shocks and stresses related to climate variability and change (Corvalan  et al., 2020). Some may be sudden shocks from extreme weather events, which both threaten the facility, staff and patients and increase the number of people seeking health care. There are extensive reports of health facilities being damaged after major floods and windstorms (e.g., 2010 floods in Pakistan, Hurricane Sandy in the USA) which can be further exacerbated by power and water supply failures (Powell, Hanfling and Gostin, 2012). Disruption to services may persist for many months because of damage to buildings, loss of drugs and equipment, and damaged transport infrastructure significantly increasing travel time for patients (Hierink  et al., 2020). The impacts of climate change on the health of residents of ‘slum’ settlements will also compound the existing health burdens faced by these individuals, including infectious disease and other environmental public health concerns (Lilford  et al., 2016; Mberu  et al., 2016).
