For the urban housing sector, climate impacts such as flooding, heat, fire and wind assessed in Section 6.2.3 will likely  have detrimental effects on housing stock (including physical damage and loss of property value) and on residents exposed to climate risks (robust evidence, high agreement ).In the USA, for example, 15.4 million housing units fall within a 1-in-100-year floodplain (Wing  et al., 2018). Assessment of the Miami-Dade area in Florida noted that coastal inundation caused by tidal flooding (and to a lesser extent sea level rise) resulted in over USD 465 million in lost real-estate market value between 2005 and 2016 (McAlpine and Porter, 2018), although property values have increased from high-end housing construction and climate adaptation measures (Kim, 2020). Emergent risk reflecting novel research include aggravated moisture problems in buildings from wind driven rain (Nik  et al., 2015). Future risks from future sea level rise are elaborated in Section CCP2.2.1. Housing infrastructure are also susceptible to extreme heat and wind events (Stewart  et al., 2018). These risks are further elaborated on in Section 6.2.3, although it is important to note that heat risks, in particular, tend to be concentrated within communities with a higher proportion of social housing (Mavrogianni  et al., 2015; Sameni  et al., 2015) or low-cost government-built houses and informal settlements.
