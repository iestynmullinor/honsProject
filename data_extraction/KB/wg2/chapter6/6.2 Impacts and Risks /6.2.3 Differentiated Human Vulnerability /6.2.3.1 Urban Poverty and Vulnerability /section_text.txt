In both developed and less-developed regions, poverty in urban areas is frequently associated with higher levels of vulnerability (Huq  et al., 2020b). This is evident in both rural and urban settlements in a wide range of contexts, including the Philippines (Porio  et al., 2019; Valenzuela, Esteban and Onuki, 2020); Bangladesh (Matsuyama, Khan and Khalequzzaman, 2020); Brazil (Lemos  et al., 2016), Santiago, Chile (Inostroza, Palme and de la Barrera, 2016); and New York City (Madrigano  et al., 2015).For individuals in urban communities, new literature highlights how differences in vulnerability established by social and economic processes are further differentiated by household and individual variability and intersectionality (Kaijser and Kronsell, 2014; Kuran  et al., 2020).This includes differences in wealth and capacity (Romero-Lankao, Gnatz and Sperling, 2016); gender and non-binary gender (Michael and Vakulabharanam, 2016; Sauer and Stie√ü, 2021; Mersha and van Laerhoven, 2018); education, health, political power and social capital (Lemos  et al., 2016); age, including young and elderly, low physical fitness, pre-existing disability, length of residence and social and ethnic marginalisation (Inostroza, Palme and de la Barrera, 2016; Schuster  et al., 2017; Malakar and Mishra, 2017). An increasing proportion of refugees and displaced people now live in urban centres, and their characteristics also make them vulnerable to a range of shocks and stresses (Earle, 2016). While some individuals, including children, may be able to exercise agency to reduce their risk (Treichel, 2020), and some indicators are culturally specific, overall, poor, marginalised, socially isolated and informal urban households are particularly at risk (high confidence) (Brown and McGranahan, 2016; Kim  et al., 2020b; Huq  et al., 2020a; Huq  et al., 2020b).
