Particularly in low- and middle-income countries, much urban building occurs outside formal parameters and entails a high degree of urban informality. According to the United Nations statistics, the proportion of urban populations living in slums and informal settlements increased from 23% in 2014 to 23.5% in 2018 (United Nations, 2018). Informality is one pathway through which urbanisation generates differentiated vulnerability, tending to increase exposure and susceptibility of physical structures and their occupants to climate-related risks (Dodman  et al., 2017; Dobson, 2017) in contexts including Guadalajara, Mexico (Gran Castro and Ramos De Robles, 2019), Kampala, Uganda (Richmond, Myers and Namuli, 2018), Bengaluru, India (Kumar, Geneletti and Nagendra, 2016), and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (Yahia  et al., 2018). In addition to facing emerging water- and heat-related risks, such areas are also more vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change (Scovronick, Lloyd and Kovats, 2015).Even where formal planning is the norm, this has often remained oriented toward enabling value by adding construction or the protection of existing high-value physical assets, for example infrastructure and built cultural heritage, private residential) rather than enabling disaster risk reduction for all (Long and Rice, 2019). This tendency has been widely documented, including from cases in Australia, Thailand, Indonesia (King  et al., 2016), Canada (Stevens and Senbel, 2017), Amman, Moscow and Delhi (Jabareen, 2015), and South Africa (Arfvidsson  et al., 2017). Such inconsistencies between the delivery of land use planning and the aims of the SDGs combine with other social structures, economic pathways and governance systems to shape city risk profiles (Dodman  et al., 2017).
