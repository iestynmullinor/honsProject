Since the late 1990s, transnational municipal networks (TMNs) have increased awareness of climate change and served as a bridge for cities to access critical financial resources from private and philanthropic sources (Rashidi and Patt, 2018; Fünfgeld, 2015). Recently, TMNs have taken on more programmatic functions, working with cities to strategise, plan and incrementally improve their organisation functions in the face of climate change. For example, the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities program (2014–2019) provided a two-year salary for a Chief Resilience Officer (CRO) to be situated in a municipal authority to bridge silos, incentivise change and develop development strategies for resilience (Bellinson and Chu, 2019; Spaans and Waterhout, 2017). In these cases, external actors have enabled broad organisation change, resource mobilisation pathways and alternative forms of agenda-setting in cities (Chu, 2018; Hakelberg, 2014) (see also Case Study 6.2, Semarang).A range of TMNs also support and encourage cities and settlements to plan and implement adaptation actions. ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability has developed protocols and implemented projects for member cities. The C40 Climate Leadership Group has facilitated the coordination of both local governments and business actors at a global scale (Gordon, 2020). Policy coordination has been central to the signatories of the Covenant of Mayors (Domorenok  et al., 2020). Such networks can encourage the sharing of information about appropriate practices between urban areas; contribute to goal setting; support experimentation and development of new policy instruments; enhance stakeholder engagement; institutionalise climate agendas; and encourage policy integration across governance levels and sectors (Bellinson and Chu, 2019; Busch, Bendlin and Fenton, 2018; Fünfgeld, 2015; Busch, 2015; Papin, 2019; Rashidi and Patt, 2018). However, participation in TMNs is biased toward cities in the Global North (Bansard, Pattberg and Widerberg, 2017; Haupt and Coppola, 2019). A recent comparative study of 337 cities found out that cities that participation in TNMs are more likely to take adaptation action and that being part of multiple networks leads to higher levels of adaptation planning (Heikkinen  et al., 2020).
