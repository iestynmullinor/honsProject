Inclusive and sustainable adaptation can address the causes of systemic vulnerability (medium evidence, high agreement ). This points to the fundamental requirements of adaptation action in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Climate justice theories draw on the environmental justice movement experiences at the local level (Bickerstaff, 2012; Bickerstaff, Walker and Bulkeley, 2013; Perez  et al., 2015; Hall, Hards and Bulkeley, 2013). Slogans such as ‘leave no one behind’ embedded in international policy for cities and settlements recognise the connection between systems of oppression and exclusion that reproduce and perpetuate urban inequality and the delivery of urban services and security (Kabeer, 2016; Stuart and Woodroffe, 2016).Intersectional strategies of action seek to consider the multiple forms of structural oppression experienced at the local level (Grunenfelder and Schurr, 2015) and, in the context of adaptation, explain how they produce or exacerbate vulnerabilities. For example, intersectionality ties with the idea of how multiple deprivations shape access to services (from sanitation to health and education) and the exposition to environmental risks (Sicotte, 2014; Lau and Scales, 2016; Van Aelst and Holvoet, 2016; Lievanos and Horne, 2017; Raza, 2017; Yon and Nadimpalli, 2017; European Environment Agency, 2020) (see Box 6.6 on the participation of women in local decision making bodies). For example, fisherwomen in the western coast of India rely on a complex arrangement of relationships around categories of class, caste and gender that shapes their possibilities to draw political resources to maintain their livelihoods and, hence, influence the dynamics of transformation (Thara, 2016). Intersectionality is central to build resilience across communities, rather than in particular areas (Khosla and Masaud, 2010; Reckien  et al., 2017). Including intersectionality deliberately in partnerships with communities can empower socially excluded groups and highlight justice issues while aligning agendas with local development priorities (Castán Broto  et al., 2015a). Despite the high confidence on the growing importance of intersectionality concerns in the delivery of just environmental policies, there is limited evidence of its explicit inclusion in adaptation policies.
