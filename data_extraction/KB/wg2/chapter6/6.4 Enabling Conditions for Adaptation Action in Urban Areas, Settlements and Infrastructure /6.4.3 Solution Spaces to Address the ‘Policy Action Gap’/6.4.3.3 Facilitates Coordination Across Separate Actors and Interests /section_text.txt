Coordination of adaptation policy goals cuts across cities to integrate them into international processes of climate policy formulation; coordination in cities produces effective collective outcomes, cementation of common standards and methodologies for climate action (e.g., emission inventories) (high agreement , medium evidence) (Gordon and Johnson, 2017; Hsu and Rauber, 2021). A collective global response has become a significant concern in international climate policy (Chan  et al., 2015a). The UNFCCC has adopted a role as an orchestrator, including providing framework for city governments (Bäckstrand and Kuyper, 2017). Within cities, coordination can arise from active programming; for example, in Rotterdam and New York City, local authorities adopted long-term objectives and conditions for action, bringing together a multiplicity of actors across sectors to orient contributions, share knowledge and coordinate actions (Hölscher  et al., 2019). Where national politics is supportive, coordination between city and national government is an asset (Chan and Amling, 2019; Inch, 2019). The use of social media and digital mechanisms for coordination with public interest is ambiguous: in China, Weibo has facilitated an expansion of public engagement, although it remains top down and dominated by a few influencial actors (Liu and Zhao, 2017; Yang and Stoddart, 2021). The pilot project #OurChangingClimate is one example of engaging youth with an understanding of their communities and their resilience or vulnerability to climate change (Napawan, Simpson and Snyder, 2017).
