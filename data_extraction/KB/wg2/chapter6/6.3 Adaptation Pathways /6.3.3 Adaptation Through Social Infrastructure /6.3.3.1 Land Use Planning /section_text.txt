Land use planning plays a major role in the siting of settlements and infrastructure. In relation to climate change, it affects whether development takes place in locations that are exposed to hazards; similarly, it shapes the potential effects that the built environment can have on natural systems. Despite this, generally speaking, there is limited implementation of zoning and land use measures for climate adaptation from cities across diverse contexts (robust evidence, high agreement ), see for example Maputo (Castán Broto, 2014), sub-Saharan cities (Dodman  et al., 2017) and Amman, Moscow and Delhi (Jabareen, 2015). Certain countries, such as South Korea, have, however, recently begun to address disaster risk reduction within their land use planning systems (Han  et al., 2019).Conventional zoning regulations (in which only one kind of use is permitted in a given area) and land use planning range in scale from the regional to the local and can be deployed to minimise risks through protection, accommodation or retreat. Protection entails, in addition to allocating zones for protective urban infrastructure (such as seawalls, levees and dykes, and slope revetments), avoidance measures that restrict or prevent urban development (e.g., through growth containment and/or no-build zones). Accommodation involves land use modifications and/or conversions while retreat requires either compulsory or voluntary relocations and may entail buyouts (Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; León and March, 2016; Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018). Risk eliminating retreat measures are less widely adopted than other risk reducing zoning and land use measures (Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018). This is attributed to the controversies of relocation and to the complexities of buyouts (Butler, Deyle and Mutnansky, 2016; King  et al., 2016).Evidence from both richer countries and the Global South reveals that conventional zoning is more effective when governance systems facilitate the implementation of land use policies for climate adaptation that preclude negative human-nature interactions and that curb spatial inequity, both of which can trigger climate gentrification and increase the vulnerability of economically disadvantaged groups to climate-related risk (high confidence) (Marks, 2015; Liotta  et al., 2020; Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018). Cascading benefits of zoning and land use planning for climate adaptation are associated with the use of soft land cover, green infrastructure and improvement of livability through better conditions for walkability and cycling. This decreases auto-dependency and contributes to health and economic development (by attracting businesses and retail that stimulate economic prosperity and increase property values) (Larsen, 2015; Carter  et al., 2015). Such increases in property values have also been observed in zones and areas protected from risks (such as flooding), where it may trigger spatial inequity leading to climate gentrification (Marks, 2015; Votsis, 2017; Votsis and Perrels, 2016; Keenan, Hill and Gumber, 2018).Adaptation actions through zoning and land use are more effective when combined with other planning measures (high confidence), for example with ecosystem-based adaptations (e.g., for flood management and curbing the urban heat island effect) (Larsen, 2015; Nalau and Becken, 2018; Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Carter  et al., 2015; Tsuda and Duarte, 2018; Nolon, 2016); with community-based adaptations (trade-offs and valuations, i.e., which land uses are valued more) (Larsen, 2015; Nalau and Becken, 2018; Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Anguelovski  et al., 2016; Carter  et al., 2015; McPhearson  et al., 2018; Nolon, 2016); and with built form regulations and codes (León and March, 2016; Yiannakou and Salata, 2017; Perera and Emmanuel, 2018; Straka and Sodoudi, 2019; Larsen, 2015; Nolon, 2016). The imposition of planning-based tools such as scenario planning, flexible zoning and development incentivisation (among others) has the capacity to influence and encourage these adaptations (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2017). Local risk-reduction inputs can inform land use adaptation policies (accommodation and/or avoidance, specifically growth containment and no-build zones) that are better integrated within larger urban plans (Lyles, Berke and Overstreet, 2018; Nalau and Becken, 2018; Tsuda and Duarte, 2018) (limited evidence, high agreement ).Implementation of zoning and land use measures for climate adaptation from cities across diverse contexts remains limited (high agreement , robust evidence) owing to a range of challenges. A range of evidence from multiple locations indicates the challenges of mainstreaming land use planning for climate adaptation, including in Bangkok, Thailand (Marks, 2015), Legazpi City and Camalig Municipality in the Philippines (Cuevas  et al., 2016; Cuevas, 2016), the USA (Cuevas  et al., 2016; Cuevas, 2016), British Columbia, Canada (Stevens and Senbel, 2017), and Australia (Serrao-Neumann  et al., 2017). Mainstreaming is hindered by a lack of clarity of implementation strategies for climate adaptation, insufficient funding, competing priorities (especially among professional planners and politicians), institutional challenges (see Jabareen’s [2015] study of 20 cities globally) and the need to fill data gaps and continuously update weather statistics (Oberlack and Eisenack, 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement ). At the same time, however, limited evidence from cities around the world such as the urban regions of Stuttgart and Berlin in Germany (Larsen, 2015), Greater Manchester in the UK (Carter  et al., 2015), and Colombo in Sri Lanka (Perera and Emmanuel, 2018) reveals that risk reduction through zoning and land use can effectively protect and expand green infrastructure and soft land cover to alleviate pluvial flooding and decrease the urban heat island effect. This evidence points that one of the primary roles of land use planning is to guide the development of the urban form. As such, it underpins and establishes the basis for other infrastructure systems such as physical infrastructure and nature-based solutions (Morrissey, Moloney and Moore, 2018).
