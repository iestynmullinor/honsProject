Table 6.6 represents the contribution of 21 adaptation measures identified in this chapter to 17 components of climate resilient development (CRD). CRD brings together the aims of climate adaptation, climate mitigation, sustainable development and social justice (Singh and Chudasama, 2021). This provides a first assessment of the viability of adaptation to cities, settlements and key infrastructure as a part of global transition to sustainability (see also Cross-Chapter Box FEASIB in Chapter 18).Table 6.6 | Urban climate resilient developmentAdaption MeasureLand-use planning 6.3.2.1Livelihoods and social protection 6.3.2.2Emergency management and security 6.3.2.3Health 6.3.2.4Education & Comms. 6.3.2.5Cultural heritage & institutions 6.3.2.6Temp. regulation 6.3.3.1Air quality regulation 6.3.3.2Stormwater and sanitation 6.3.3.3Coastal flood protection 6.3.3.4Riverine flood impact reduction 6.3.3.5Water provisioning and management 6.3.3.6Food production and security 6.3.3.7Built form 6.3.4.1Housing and building design 6.3.4.2ICT 6.3.4.3Energy Inf. 6.3.4.4Transport 6.3.4.5Water and sanitation 6.3.4.6Flood management 6.3.4.7Coastal management 6.3.4.8Inf.

Supplementary Material provides a detailed analysis including definitions for each component of climate resilient development and for each of the 357 entries an underlying explanatory statement linked to key evidence. Analysis was by Chapter 6 Lead and Contributing Authors.Two overarching messages and one key consequence for planning arise from Figure 6.4. First, urban adaptation measures can offer a considerable contribution to CRD. Second, this potential is realised by adaptations that extend predominant physical infrastructure approaches to also deploy nature-based solutions and social interventions. The consequence for planning is support for comprehensive monitoring and joined-up evaluation across the multiple components of CRD, as well as between the sectors that contribute to adaptation.Table 6.6 shows that adapting key grey/physical infrastructure (built form and design, ICT, energy, transport, water and sanitation) is fundamental to CRD. This provides resilience to a range of hazards, with benefits to livelihoods, social capital and health, and provides benefits for the adaptation of other, connected infrastructure systems. Challenges to the contributions of grey/physical infrastructure, where adaptation through nature-based solutions and social policy offer alternatives are a lack of flexibility post-deployment constraining ability to flex as climate and vulnerability change; risk transferred to other people/places, not resolved; negative ecological consequences; and limited evidence of targeting marginality and inequality.The significance of a CRD lens for the evaluation of adaptation strategy can be seen in approaches to riverine and coastal flooding. This viewpoint brings physical (e.g., embankments and defenses), nature-based (e.g., mangrove stands) and social policy (livelihood and social protection) options together. The benefits of physical infrastructure interventions for strengthening existing livelihoods and protecting health, for being deployable at scale and supporting other infrastructures to adapt are recognised and set these against challenges including hazard generation and risk transfer, limited flexibility, ecological harm, carbon costs and an undermining of social inclusion and accountability. Final evaluations will be determined by individual contexts, raising the importance of comprehensive monitoring of existing urban systems adaptation interventions and their association with ongoing development processes and outcomes (see Section 6.4).The most consistent limit for all urban systems infrastructure types is in risk transfer. Current adaptation approaches in cities, settlements and key infrastructure have a tendency to move risk from one sector or place to others. With the exception of social infrastructure, the observed contribution of adaptation to social transformation is also limited. There are consequences for equity and sustainability as the impacts of climate change increase, and implications for evaluation and planning to work across adaptation interventions and connect with social and environmental policy and practice.
