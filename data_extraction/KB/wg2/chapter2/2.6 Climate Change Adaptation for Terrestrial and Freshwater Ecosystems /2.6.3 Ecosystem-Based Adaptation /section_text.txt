A study published in 2020 found that, out of 162 intended nationally determined contributions (covering 189 countries) submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as commitments to action under the Paris Agreement, 109 indicated ‘ecosystem-orientated visions’ for adaptation, but only 23 used the term ‘ecosystem-based adaptation’ (Seddon et al., 2020b).EbA includes a range of different approaches. Examples include restoring coastal and river systems to reduce flood risk and improve water quality, and the creation of natural areas within urban areas to reduce temperatures through shading and evaporative cooling. EbA is closely linked with a variety of other concepts such as ecosystem services, natural capital and disaster risk reduction (DRR). EbA was becoming a well-recognised concept at the time of AR5 but implementation was still at an early stage in many cases. Since then, pilot studies have been assessed and EbA projects have been initiated around the world. The evidence base continues to grow (Table 2.7), and this has led to increasing confidence in approaches which have been shown to work leading to further expansion in some countries (Table 2.7). However, this is not uniform and there is relatively little synthesis across disciplines and regions (Seddon et al., 2020a). Chausson et al. (2020) used a systematic mapping methodology to characterise 386 published studies. They found that interventions in natural or semi-natural ecosystems ameliorated adverse climate change impacts in 66% of cases, with fewer trade-offs than for more artificial systems such as plantation forest. However, the evidence base has substantial gaps. Most of the evidence has been collected in the Global North, and there is a lack of robust, site-specific investigations into the effectiveness of interventions compared to alternatives and more holistic appraisals that account for broader social and ecological outcomes.Restoring coasts, rivers and wetlands to reduce flood risk have probably seen the largest investment in EbA and it is becoming an increasingly accepted approach in some places (e.g., case studies in Sections 2.6.5.2, 2.6.5.7), although significant social, economic and technical barriers remain (Wells et al., 2020; Bark et al., 2021; Hagedoorn et al., 2021). Natural flood management (NFM) encompasses a wide range of techniques in river systems and at the coast and has been used in varied locations around the world. In tropical and subtropical areas, the restoration of mangroves to reduce the risk of coastal flooding is a widely advocated, evidence-based approach (e.g., (Høye et al., 2013; Sierra-Correa and Kintz, 2015; Powell et al., 2019)). In temperate regions, salt marsh is a similarly important habitat (Spalding et al., 2014). Both provide buffering against SLR and storm surges. Managed realignment of the coast, by creating new habitats, can lead to a loss of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, but it can protect them and the services they provide by reducing the risks of catastrophic failure from hard-engineered sea defences.Table 2.7 | Examples of key EbA measures with assessments of confidence.

restoring upstream wetlands or creating them in urban and peri-urban situations can store water during flood events if they are in the right place in a catchment (Acreman and Holden, 2013; Ameli and Creed, 2019; Wu et al., 2020). There is less data on the potential for NFM in tropical compared to temperate catchments. However, (Ogden et al., 2013) showed that flooding was reduced from a secondary forested catchment area compared to those which were pasture or a mosaic of forest, pasture and subsistence agriculture. EbA approaches to reduce flooding can be applied within urban areas as well as in rural catchments, as in Durban, South Africa (Section 2.6.5.7), but effectiveness will depend on EbA being implemented at a sufficient scale and in the right locations (Hobbie and Grimm, 2020; Costa et al., 2021). This may, in turn, provide protection to downstream urban communities.Protecting and restoring natural river systems and natural vegetation cover within catchments as well as integrating agro-ecological techniques into agricultural systems can also help to maintain and manage water supplies for human use, under climate change, including during periods of drought, by storing water in catchments and improving water quality (Taffarello et al., 2018; Agol et al., 2021; Khaniya et al., 2021). Lara et al. (2021) showed that replacing a non-native Eucalyptus plantation in Chile with native forest caused base flow to increase by 28–87% during the restoration period compared to pre-treatment, and found that it remained during periods with low summer precipitation.EbA can operate on a range of different scales, from local to catchment to region. On the local scale, there is a variety of circumstances in which microclimates can be managed and local temperatures lowered by the presence of vegetation (Table 2.7), and these EbA techniques are now being used more widely. In both urban and agricultural situations, shade trees are a traditional technique which can be applied to contemporary climate change adaptation. As reported in Section 2.6.2 above, shading of watercourses can lower temperatures, which can allow species to survive locally; as well as supporting diversity, it can help to maintain important fisheries, including those of salmonid fish (O’Briain et al., 2020). Within cities, green spaces, including parks, local nature reserves and green roofs and walls can also provide cooling as a result of evapotranspiration (Bowler et al., 2010a; Aram et al., 2019; Hobbie and Grimm, 2020), although this may be reduced in drought conditions.Wildfire is an increasing risk for people as well as to ecosystems in many parts of the world. As discussed in Section 2.4.4.2, this is the result not just of climate change but also past management practices, including fire suppression. Better fire management including reinstating more natural fire regimes can reduce risks.EbA is usually a place-specific approach and a number of studies have documented how attempts to implement it without an understanding of local circumstances and the full engagement of local communities have been unsuccessful (Nalau et al., 2018). Since AR5, a number of studies have considered the factors that are important for environment adaptation programmes and projects (UNFCCC, 2015; Nalau et al., 2018; Duncan et al., 2020; EPA Network and ENCA, 2020; Townsend et al., 2020). Considering these sources, others described above and the case studies presented in Section 2.6.5, a number of requirements for effective implementation of EbA can be identified, including the following:Targeting of the right EbA measure in the right locationDecision-making at the appropriate level of governance with participation from all affected communitiesIntegration of IKLK and capacity into decision-making and the management of projectsInvolvement of government and non-government stakeholdersFull integration of EbA with other policy areas including agriculture, water resources and protection of natural resourcesProtection and, if possible, improvement of incomes of local peopleEffective institutional support to manage finances and the implementation of projects and programmesTime—many EbA interventions take time to establish, for example, for trees to grow and wetlands to recoverMonitoring of intended outcomes and other impacts and the communication of resultsWhilst it is essential to develop place-specific EbA measures with the full engagement of local communities, it is worth noting that new opportunities may emerge that would not have been possible in the past. As the climate changes, novel ecosystems may emerge (with no present day analogue) which have the potential to provide different adaptation benefits, and societies may be more willing to adopt transformative approaches (Colloff et al., 2017; Lavorel et al., 2020).Increasingly, it is essential to integrate adaptation and the protection of biodiversity with land-based initiatives to mitigate climate change; this is discussed in more detail in Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter. The new IUCN standard (IUCN, 2020) offers a basis for assessing whether actions are true NbS and take into account the wider factors necessary for success.Whilst policy interest is growing and there is an increasing deployment of EbA, there is still a long way to go in delivering its full potential (Huq and Stubbings, 2015) and significant institutional and cultural barriers remain (Huq et al., 2017; Nalau et al., 2018). Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear that EbA can offer a portfolio of effective measures to reduce the risks for people of climate change at the same time as benefitting biodiversity (robust evidence, high agreement ), providing that such measures are deployed with careful planning in a way that is appropriate for local ecological and societal contexts (robust evidence, high agreement ). This chapter has identified risks to species, communities, ecosystems and ecosystem services from climate change, all of which increase with each increment of Global Warming Level (2.5.1, 2.5.2, 2.5.3, 2.5.4). There is therefore a risk to Ecosystem-based Adaptation measures in some circumstances and this risk increases progressively above 1.5°C of warming.
