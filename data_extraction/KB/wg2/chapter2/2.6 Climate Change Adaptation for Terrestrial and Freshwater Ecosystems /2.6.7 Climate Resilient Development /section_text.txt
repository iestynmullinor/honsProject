CRD is the subject of Chapter 18. This section briefly assesses some of the fundamental issues for CRD relating to ecosystems. An overview of the importance of specific ecosystem services for CRD is presented in Box 18.7 in Chapter 18. A large body of evidence has demonstrated the extent to which human life, well-being and economies are dependent on healthy ecosystems and also the range of threats that these are faced with (high confidence) (IPBES, 2019; Dasgupta, 2021; Pörtner et al., 2021). An analysis of 64 studies found a strong positive synergy among eight critical regulating services of healthy ecosystems, including climate regulation, water provisioning, pest and disease control and adjacent-crop pollination (Lee and Lautenbach, 2016). The health of ecosystems is, in turn, reliant upon the maintenance of natural levels of species’ richness and functional diversity (high confidence) (Lavorel et al., 2020) (see Section 2.5.4). A meta-analysis of 74 studies documented that the mechanism for increased ecosystem stability is increased asynchrony among species, which itself is a product of greater species diversity (Xu et al., 2021b). Responding to these threats requires the protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural ecosystems, together with sustainable management of other areas.The CBD set the Aichi 2020 Target at 17% of each country to be protected for biodiversity. Analyses suggest that 30% or even 50% of land and sea needs to be protected or restored to confer adequate protection for species and ecosystem services (high confidence) (Dinerstein et al., 2019; Woodley et al., 2019; Brooks et al., 2020; Hannah et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Sala et al., 2021). Hannah et al. (2020) estimated that limiting warming to 2°C and protecting 30% of high-biodiversity regions (in Africa, Asia and Latin America) reduced the risk of species’ extinctions by half (medium confidence). The placement of protected areas is as important as the total area (Pimm et al., 2018), and the quality of the protection (strictness and enforcement) is as important as the official land designation (Shah et al., 2021). Pimm et al. (2018) found that many small protected areas are successful because they are in areas of very high biodiversity containing species with small range sizes, while many large regions identified as wild are often of low biodiversity value even though they may have a high mitigation value (e.g., the high Arctic tundra). A global meta-analysis of 89 restoration projects found that biodiversity increased by 44% and ecosystem services by 25% after restoration but values remained lower than in intact reference systems (Rey Benayas et al., 2009).There is also increasing evidence, reported in this chapter, that the loss and degradation of natural and semi-natural habitats exacerbates the impacts of climate change and climatic extreme events on biodiversity and ecosystem services (high confidence) (e.g., in (Ogden et al., 2013; Eigenbrod et al., 2015; Struebig et al., 2015; Stevens et al., 2016; Oliver et al., 2017; McAlpine et al., 2018; Taffarello et al., 2018; Lehikoinen et al., 2019; Birk et al., 2020; Chapman et al., 2020; Agol et al., 2021; Khaniya et al., 2021; Lara et al., 2021; Lehikoinen et al., 2021). Considering these two sets of evidence together, it is clear that climate change adaptation and ecosystem degradation both need to be addressed if either is to be tackled successfully (robust evidence, high agreement ) as a number of recent publications concluded (Haddad et al., 2015; Hannah et al., 2020; Arneth et al., 2021; Pörtner et al., 2021). Taking this combined body of evidence, the assessment is that the protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural ecosystems are key adaptation measures (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Section 2.5.4).Large-scale protection and restoration of ecosystems can also make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation (Dinerstein et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2020a; Soto-Navarro et al., 2020). Globally, there is a 38% overlap between areas of high carbon storage and high intact biodiversity (mainly in the peatland tropical forests of Asia, the western Amazon and the high Arctic), but only 12% of this is protected (high confidence) (see also sections 2.4.4.4.1, 2.4.4.4.3, 2.5.3.4) (Soto-Navarro et al., 2020). Peatlands are particularly important carbon stores but are threatened by human disturbance, LULCC (Leifeld et al., 2019) and fire (sections 2.4.3.8, 2.5.2.8) (Turetsky et al., 2015). Restoration of peatlands is not only an efficient climate solution in terms of emissions of GHGs (Nugent et al., 2019), it may also increase ecosystem resilience (Glenk et al., 2021). Global restoration efforts are ongoing to target degraded temperate peatlands in the Americas and Europe (Chimner et al., 2017) in recognition of their importance for climate change mitigation (Paustian et al., 2016; Bossio et al., 2020; Humpenöder et al., 2020; Drever et al., 2021; Tanneberger et al., 2021). It has been estimated that the global GHG-saving potential of peatland restoration is similar to the most optimistic sequestration potential from all agricultural soils (Leifeld and Menichetti, 2018). However, the pressure on peatlands from human activity remains high in many parts of the world (Humpenöder et al., 2020; Tanneberger et al., 2021). Currently, the rapid destruction of tropical peatlands overshadows any current restoration efforts in temperate peatlands or any potential carbon gain from natural high-latitude peatlands (Roucoux et al., 2017; Wijedasa et al., 2017; Leifeld et al., 2019) (Sections 2.4.3.8, 2.4.4.4.2, 2.4.4.4.4, 2.5.2.8, 2.5.3.4).Recent studies have highlighted the importance of ensuring that ecosystem protection is not implemented in a way which disadvantages those who live in or depend on the most intact ecosystems (Mehrabi et al., 2018; Schleicher et al., 2019) or risk food security. The actual area of land to be protected and the balance between sustainable use and protection will need careful planning and targeting to where it can have the most benefit (Pimm et al., 2018). It will also be important to ensure that protection measures are effective in preventing damage (Shah et al., 2021).At a local level, EbA can often provide a wide range of additional benefits for sustainable development in both rural and urban areas (Wilbanks, 2003; Nelson et al., 2007; Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016; Hobbie and Grimm, 2020; Martín et al., 2020). A number of the case studies above, such as in Durban and at Bhojtal Lake, illustrate this (section 2.6.5). A key element of CRD is ensuring that actions taken to mitigate climate change do not compromise adaptation, biodiversity and human needs. This depends on choosing appropriate actions for different locations (Box 2.2, Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter). A particularly notable case of this is the creation of woodland described in Box 2.2: re-afforestation of previously forested areas can provide multiple benefits (Lee et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020) including those for climate change mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity. However, planting trees where they would not naturally grow can create multiple problems including the loss of native biodiversity and the disruption of hydrology (Box 2.2). It is also the case that protection of existing natural forest ecosystems is the highest priority for reducing GHG emissions (Moomaw et al., 2019) and restoration may not always be practical (see Section 2.6.5.10). (Sections 2.4.3.6, 2.4.3.7, 2.4.4.3, 2.4.4.4, 2.5.2.6, 2.5.2.7, 2.5.3.3, Box 2.2, Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in this chapter)In some cases, actions supported by international donors and presented as addressing climate change adaptation and mitigation in the natural environment can have damaging consequences for people and nature as well as failing to deliver adaptation and mitigation. One example of this was presented by Work et al. (2019), who reviewed three climate change mitigation and adaptation projects in Cambodia: an irrigation project, a protected-area forest management project and a reforestation project. In each case, they found evidence of the rights of local communities being violated, maladaptation and the destruction of biodiverse habitats. They concluded that the potential for maladaptation and adverse social and environmental impacts had been ignored by international donors and the national authorities, and that there was a need for much stricter accountability mechanisms. Moyo et al. (2021), using case studies from South Africa, documented greater success of ecosystem restoration projects when they embraced broader SDGs, particularly enhancement of people’s livelihoods. Better assessment of the impacts of adaptation and mitigation measures on people and ecosystems, before they are implemented, will be increasingly necessary to avoid unintended and damaging consequences as their deployment is scaled up (Larsen, 2014; Enríquez-de-Salamanca et al., 2017; Pour et al., 2017). This applies to ostensibly nature-based approaches as well as more engineering-based ones.Another aspect of the benefits to people from ecosystems that needs to be taken into account in CRD is increasingly strong evidence of the benefits of natural environments for human health and well-being beyond the provision of basic necessities such as food and water (Bratman et al., 2019; Marselle et al., 2021). Meta-analyses of 162 studies involving 51,738 people documented that individuals with high levels of contact with nature throughout their lives felt significantly happier, healthier and more satisfied with their lives, and engaged in more pro-nature behaviours than those with little or no contact with nature (high confidence) (Capaldi et al., 2014; Mackay and Schmitt, 2019; Pritchard et al., 2020; Whitburn et al., 2020). Meta-analyses of manipulative human trials across 65 studies documented a significant increase in positive feelings and attitudes and a decline in negative feelings after experimental treatments involving nature (medium confidence) (Bowler et al., 2010b; McMahan and Estes, 2015; Soga et al., 2017). In the context of CRD improving the extent to which humans see themselves as part of the natural world— known as human-nature connectedness (HNC)— increasing access to natural areas, particularly within urban areas, can provide additional health, cultural and recreation benefits of NbS as well as increasing public engagement and support (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Wilbanks, 2003; Nelson et al., 2007; Bowler et al., 2010b; Capaldi et al., 2014; McMahan and Estes, 2015; Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016; Soga et al., 2017; Mackay and Schmitt, 2019; Work et al., 2019; Hobbie and Grimm, 2020; Pritchard et al., 2020; Whitburn et al., 2020).
