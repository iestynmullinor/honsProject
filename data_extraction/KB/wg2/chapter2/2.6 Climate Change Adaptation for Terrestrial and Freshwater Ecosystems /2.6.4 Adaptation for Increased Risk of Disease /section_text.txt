Low-probability events can have a very high impact (e.g., the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from wild animals to humans, causing the Covid-19 pandemic ). A robust disease risk reduction policy would include utilising One Biosecurity (Meyerson and Reaser, 2002; Hulme, 2020; MacLeod and Spence, 2020) or One Health (Monath et al., 2010; Deem et al., 2018; Destoumieux-Garz칩n et al., 2018; Zinsstag et al., 2018) approaches with actions to reduce disease risk across multiple sectors and from a variety of anthropogenic drivers, including climate change, even if there is high uncertainty in projected risk (see Cross-Chapter Boxes ILLNESS in this chapter, COVID in Chapter 7 and DEEP in Chapter 17). Kraemer et al. (2019) found that vector importation was a key risk factor and that the focus should be on preventing the introduction of invasive species. Furthermore, many neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are also VBDs, and the UN SDG of good health and well-being explicitly calls for increased control and intervention with a focus on emergency preparedness and response (Stensgaard et al., 2019a).Online tools are being developed to warn conservation biologists when species of conservation concern are at a greater risk of disease outbreaks due to environmental changes, for example, for Hawaiian honeycreepers and avian malaria (Berio Fortini et al., 2020) and coral diseases (Caldwell et al., 2016). Forecasting models to warn of human disease outbreaks like malaria and dengue are also now available, with findings that multiple-model ensemble forecasts outperform individual models (Lowe et al., 2013; Lowe et al., 2014; Lowe et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2018; Johansson et al., 2019; Tompkins et al., 2019; Mu침oz et al., 2020; Col칩n-Gonz치lez et al., 2021; Petrova et al., 2021). Improving VBD and NTD public health responses will require multi-disciplinary teams capable of interpreting, analysing, and synthesising diverse components of complex ecosystem-based studies for effective intervention (Mills et al., 2010; Rubin et al., 2014; Valenzuela and Aksoy, 2018), broad epidemiological and entomological surveillance (Depaquit et al., 2010; Lindgren et al., 2012; Springer et al., 2016) as well as community-based disease control programmes that build local capacity (Andersson et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2020b).
