Scale: LocalIssue: Protection of water resources and biodiversityThe city of Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh state in central India, is dependent for its water supply on Bhojtal, a large man-made lake bordering the city (Everard et al., 2020). Bhojtal is also an important conservation site, with its wetlands protected under the Ramsar convention and diverse flora and fauna (WWF, 2006). It also provides a wide range of other benefits to people, including tourism, recreation, navigation and subsistence and commercial fisheries, supporting the livelihoods of many families (Verma, 2001).Climate change in Bhopal may pose ecological and socioeconomic stresses due to changes in rainfall and weather patterns (Ministry of Environment et al., 2019), and exacerbated by a series of problems such as waste-water discharge, illegal digging of bore wells and unsustainable water extraction/exploitation (Everard et al., 2020). Ecosystem service provision at Bhojtal was assessed using the Rapid Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem Services (RAWES) approach, including an analysis of the lake’s water quality. Information on the geology, hydrology and catchment ecology of the lake was collected and a baseline biodiversity assessment was conducted.The Lake Bhopal Conservation and Management Project (JICA, 2007) was developed with the following actions:Desilting and dredging; deepening and widening of spill channel; prevention of pollution (sewage scheme); management of shoreline and fringe area; improvement and management of water qualitySoil and water conservation measures using vegetative and engineering structures, particularly at upper ridges of watersheds; construction of small check dams or percolation tanks for recharge purposes in areas marked for ‘drainage line recharge measures’Afforestation initiativesImplementation of these measures with the help of local communities improved the lake’s health. NbS are more resilient adaptation measures towards climate change. Restoration not only reduced water stress but also provides multiple societal benefits in the urban area (Kabisch et al., 2016).
