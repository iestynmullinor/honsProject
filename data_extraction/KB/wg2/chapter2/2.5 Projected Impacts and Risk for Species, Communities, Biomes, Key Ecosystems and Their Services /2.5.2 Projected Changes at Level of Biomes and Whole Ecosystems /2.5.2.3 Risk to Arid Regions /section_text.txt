Shifts in arid system structure and functioning that have been observed to date (Section 2.4.3.3) are projected to continue  (medium confidence). These include widespread woody plant encroachment, notably in savanna systems in Africa, Australia and South America, and are attributed to interactions of LULCC, climate change and CO2 fertilisation effects (Fensholt et al., 2012; Fang et al., 2017; Stevens et al., 2017). Arid Mongolian steppe grassland did not respond to experimentally elevated CO2 (Song et al., 2019). Woody encroachment is projected to continue or not reverse in North American drylands (Caracciolo et al., 2016) and southern African arid ecosystems (Moncrieff et al., 2014b). Dryland woody encroachment may increase carbon stocks, depending on emissions scenario (Martens et al., 2021), but reduce soil water and biodiversity of grassland-dependent species diversity (Archer et al., 2017). Warm season (C4) grass expansion into arid shrublands risks sudden ecosystem transformation due to introduced wildfire (Bradley et al., 2016), a risk anticipated for grass-invaded desert ecosystems of Australia and the southwestern USA (Horn and St. Clair, 2017). Novel fire regimes in grassy shrublands have enhanced grass cover locally in the southern African Nama-Karoo (du Toit et al., 2015).Range retractions are projected for endemic plants in southern Africa (Young et al., 2016) and dry woodlands in Morocco (Alba-SÃ¡nchez et al., 2015). Increasing thermal stress is projected to increase woody plant mortality in the Sonoran Desert ecosystems (Munson et al., 2016) and facilitate perennial grass replacement by xeric shrubs in the southwestern USA (Bestelmeyer et al., 2018). Ecological effects may occur rapidly when extreme events compound long-term trends (Hoover et al., 2015), but evolve more slowly as opportunity costs accumulate due to warming (Cross-Chapter Paper 3) (Cunningham et al., 2021).
