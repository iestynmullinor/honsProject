The overall effect of climate change on the extent of northern peatlands is still debated (limited evidence, low agreement ). It is expected that climate change will drive the expansion of high-latitude peatlands poleward of their present distribution due to warming, permafrost degradation and glacier retreat, which could provide new land and conditions favourable for peat development (limited evidence, medium agreement ) (Zhang et al., 2017b), as seen during the last de-glacial warming (robust evidence, high agreement ) (MacDonald et al., 2006; Jones and Yu, 2010; Ratcliffe et al., 2018). Peatland area loss (shrinking) near the southern limit of their current distribution or in areas where the climate becomes unsuitable is also expected (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Section 2.3.4.3.2) (Finkelstein and Cowling, 2011 Gallego-Sala and Prentice, 2013; Schneider et al., 2016; Müller and Joos, 2020) (Müller and Joos, 2021), but they could persist if moisture is maintained via their capacity to self-regulate. In western Canada, a study suggests that peatlands may persist until 2100, even though the climate will be less suitable (Schneider et al., 2016). Simulations suggest that climate change-driven increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 could drive reductions in the northern peatland area up to 18% (SSP1–2.6), 41% (SSP2–4.5) and 61% (SSP5–8.5) by 2300 (Müller and Joos, 2020). This is in contrast with the findings of northern peatland persistence and expansion under RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 scenarios in 1861–2099 by another modelling study (Qiu et al., 2020). In the Tropics, the only available study suggests peatland area will increase until 2300, mainly due to increases in precipitation and the CO2 fertilisation effect (Müller and Joos, 2020; Müller and Joos, 2021).The combination of changes in climate and land use represents a substantial risk to peatland carbon stocks, but full assessment is impeded because peatlands are yet to be included in ESMs (limited evidence, high agreement ) (Loisel et al., 2021). It is expected that the carbon balance of peatlands globally will switch from sink to source in the near future (2020–2100), mainly because tropical peatland emissions, together with those from climate change-driven permafrost thaw, will likely surpass the carbon gain expected from climate change-driven enhanced plant productivity in northern high latitudes (Gallego-Sala et al., 2018; Chaudhary et al., 2020; Turetsky et al., 2020; Loisel et al., 2021) which are mainly caused by groundwater drawdown (robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Hirano et al., 2014; Brouns et al., 2015; Cobb et al., 2017; Itoh et al., 2017; Evans et al., 2021). The overall northern peatland carbon sink has been simulated to persist for at least 300 years under RCP2.6, but not under RCP8.5 (Qiu et al., 2020).Increases in the extent, severity and duration of fires are expected in all peatland regions in the future due to temperature increases (Section 4.3.1.1), changes in precipitation patterns (Section 4.3.1.2) and increases in ignition sources (e.g., lightning) (Section 5.4.3.2), with associated rapid carbon losses to the atmosphere (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Dadap et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021a; Nelson et al., 2021). For example, drought has been linked to fires in Southeast Asian peatlands (Field et al., 2009) and there are predicted decreases in mean summer precipitation (10–30%) for high and low RCPs, particularly over the Indonesian region, by the mid and late 21st century (Section 12.4.2.2) (Tangang et al., 2020; Taufik et al., 2020). During wet years, the fire probability in Indonesian peatlands also significantly increases (by 15–40%) when temperatures in July to October surpass 0.5°C anomalies compared to the 1995–2015 baseline (Fernandes et al., 2017). Overall, current evidence suggests that peat carbon losses via fire have the potential to be equal to, or greater than, losses due to human peatland drainage and disturbance (limited evidence, high agreement ) (Turetsky et al., 2015).Regarding permafrost peatlands, studies differ, with some projecting a net loss and others a net gain of carbon (medium evidence, low agreement ) (Estop-Aragonés et al., 2018; Hugelius et al., 2020; Loisel et al., 2021; Väliranta et al., 2021). In some permafrost peatlands, prolonged and warmer growing seasons due to climate change (Section 2.3.4.3.1), along with increases in nitrogen deposition since 1850 (Lamarque et al., 2013), are promoting plant primary productivity. Other studies indicate that increased nitrogen-mediated sequestration could be exceeded by increased decomposition due to climate change-driven warming and fire (medium evidence, low agreement ) (Natali et al., 2012; Vonk et al., 2015; Keuper et al., 2017; Burd et al., 2018; Estop-Aragonés et al., 2018; Gallego-Sala et al., 2018; Serikova et al., 2018; Wild et al., 2019; Chaudhary et al., 2020; Hugelius et al., 2020).Any climate change- or human-driven degradation of peatlands will also entail losses in water storage (limited evidence, high agreement ) (Wooster et al., 2012; Hirano et al., 2015; Cole et al., 2019; Taufik et al., 2019) and biodiversity (Harrison, 2013; Lampela et al., 2017; Renou-Wilson et al., 2019). The environmental archive contained in peat that preserves records of vegetation, hydrology, climate change, pollution and/or human disturbances is also being lost as peatlands degrade (Kasischke and Turetsky, 2006; MacDonald et al., 2006; Turunen, 2008; Field et al., 2009; Flannigan et al., 2009; Jones and Yu, 2010; Kasischke et al., 2010; Peterson et al., 2010; Finkelstein and Cowling, 2011; Rooney et al., 2012; Gallego-Sala and Colin Prentice, 2013; Lamarque et al., 2013; Hirano et al., 2014; Brouns et al., 2015; Turetsky et al., 2015; Miettinen et al., 2016; Schneider et al., 2016; Cobb et al., 2017; Fernandes et al., 2017; Itoh et al., 2017; Gallego-Sala et al., 2018; Greiser and Joosten, 2018; Ratcliffe et al., 2018; Dadap et al., 2019; Leifeld et al., 2019; Chaudhary et al., 2020; Hoyt et al., 2020; Müller and Joos, 2020; Qiu et al., 2020; Tangang et al., 2020; Taufik et al., 2020; Turetsky et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021a; Evans et al., 2021; Loisel et al., 2021; Nelson et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2021).
