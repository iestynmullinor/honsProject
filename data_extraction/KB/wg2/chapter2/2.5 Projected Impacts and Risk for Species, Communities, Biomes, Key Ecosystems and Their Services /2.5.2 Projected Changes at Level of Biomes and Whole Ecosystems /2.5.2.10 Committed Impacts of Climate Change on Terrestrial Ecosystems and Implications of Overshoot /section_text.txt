Projections point to potentially large changes of canopy structure and composition within and across the terrestrial biomes in response to climate change and changes in atmospheric CO2. These changes will contribute to altered ecosystem carbon uptake and losses, biophysical climate feedbacks (Sections 2.3.2; 2.4.4; 2.5.3.2; 2.5.3.3. 2.5.3.4, 2.5.3.5, Figure 2.10, Table 2.4) and multiple other ecosystem services (Sections 2.5.3, 2.5.4) as well impacts on biodiversity (Sections 2.4.2, 2.4.3, 2.4.4, 2.4.5, 2.5.1.3, 2.5.1.4, 2.5.2, Figure Box 2.1.1, Table Box 2.1.1, Table SM2.4). Until now, most studies project changes over next decades until the end of this century.However, there is an increasing body of literature that has found continued, longer-term responses of ecosystems to climate change, so-called ‘committed changes’, that arise from lags that exist in many systems. Many processes in ecosystems take more than a few decades to quasi-equilibrate to environmental changes. Therefore, the trends of changing vegetation cover identified in simulations of transient warming continue to show up in simulations that hold climate change at low levels of warming (medium confidence) (Boulton et al., 2017; Pugh et al., 2018; Scheiter et al., 2020). Such changes, which could tip ecosystems into an alternative state, could also be triggered by a ‘warming overshoot’ if global warming were to exceed a certain threshold, even if mean temperatures afterwards decline again (Albrich et al., 2020a).For instance, even if warming achieved by 2100 remained constant after 2100, such committed responses continue to occur. These include: (1) continued Amazon forest loss (Boulton et al., 2017), consistent with results in Pugh et al. (2018) that found continued tropical forest cover loss across a range of models and simulation setups, and (2) across Africa, an increased shift towards woody C3 vegetation was found in equilibrium state, the overall response depending on the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Scheiter et al., 2020). In Pugh et al. (2018), the opposite was found for boreal forest cover, which showed a strong committed increase. The committed changes in vegetation composition correspond to large committed changes in terrestrial carbon uptake and losses (Boulton et al., 2017; Pugh et al., 2018; Scheiter et al., 2020), and would plausibly also appear in other ecosystem functioning and services. These studies point to the importance of having not only a multi-decadal but also a multi-century perspective when exploring the impacts of political decisions on climate change mitigation taken now. Even if climate-warming targets are met, published evidence so far suggests that fundamental changes in some ecosystems are likely  as these correspond to well-understood ecosystem physiological responses that trigger long-term changes in composition.
