Climate change will increase water temperatures and decrease dissolved oxygen levels (Section 2.3.1), impacting freshwater fisheries which form an important ecosystem service (Vári et al., 2022). People living in the vicinity of cold lakes will be affected by projected losses of ice. In a worst-case scenario (an air temperatures increase of 8°C), 230,400 lakes and 656 million people in 50 countries will be impacted (Reid et al., 2019; Sharma et al., 2019). Winter ice-fishing (Orru et al., 2014), transportation via ice roads (Prowse et al., 2011) and cultural activities (Magnuson and Lathrop, 2014) are ecosystem services at stake from the ongoing loss of lake ice.Eutrophication of central European lakes has wiped out a significant proportion of the endemic fish fauna (Vonlanthen et al., 2012), so climate-induced further eutrophication is expected to represent an additional threat to fish fauna and commercial fisheries (Ficke et al., 2007). Given that the ecological consequences of lake warming may be especially strong in the Tropics (Section 2.3.1.1), ecosystem services may be most affected there. Tropical lakes support important fisheries (Lynch et al., 2016a; McIntyre et al., 2016) that provide a critical source of nutrition to adjacent human populations. These lakes are especially prone to the loss of deep-water oxygen due to warming, with adverse consequences for the productivity of fisheries and for biodiversity (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Lewis Jr, 2000; Van Bocxlaer et al., 2012).Tropical lakes tend to be hotspots of freshwater biodiversity (Vadeboncoeur et al., 2011; Brawand et al., 2014; Sterner et al., 2020); ancient tropical lakes such as Malawi, Tanganyika, Victoria, Titicaca, Towuti and Matano hold thousands of animal species found nowhere else (Vadeboncoeur et al., 2011). While biodiversity and several ecosystem services can be considered synergistic (food webs, tourism and of aesthetic and spiritual value) (Langhans et al., 2019), others can be considered antagonistic in case of a strong ecosystem service demand (such as water abstraction, water use and food security in terms of overexploitation). Here, the balance between biodiversity and ecosystem services is key (Langhans et al., 2019), where biodiversity can be integrated into water policy by means of integrated water resource management (IWRM) towards NbS (Ligtvoet et al., 2017)
