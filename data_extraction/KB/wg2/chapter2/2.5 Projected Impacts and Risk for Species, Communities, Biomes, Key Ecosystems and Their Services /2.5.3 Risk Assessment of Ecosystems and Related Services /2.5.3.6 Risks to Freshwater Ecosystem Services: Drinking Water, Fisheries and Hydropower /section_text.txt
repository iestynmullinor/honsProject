River banks, riparian vegetation and macrophyte beds play important roles in erosion control through reducing current velocities, increasing sedimentation and reducing turbidity (Madsen et al., 2001). Rates of flow in rivers affect inland navigation (VÃ¡ri et al., 2022). Changing seasonality in snow-dominated basins is expected to enhance hydropower production in winter but decrease it during summer (Doell et al., 2015). Glacier melt changes hydrological regimes, sediment transport and bio-geochemical and contaminant fluxes from rivers to oceans, profoundly influencing ecosystem services that glacier-fed rivers provide, particularly the provision of water for agriculture, hydropower and consumption (Milner et al., 2017). Loss of glacial mass and snowpack has already impacted flow rates, quantities and seasonality (Chapter 4, in this report) (Hock et al., 2019). Meltwater yields from glacier ice are likely to increase in many regions during the next decades but decrease thereafter, as glaciers become smaller and smaller and finally disappear (Hock et al., 2019).
