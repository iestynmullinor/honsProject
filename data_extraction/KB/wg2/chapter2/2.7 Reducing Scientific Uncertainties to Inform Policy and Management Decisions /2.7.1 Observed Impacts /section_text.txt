Detection and attribution efforts have increased since AR5, but there are some key impacts of high societal importance that would benefit from more detailed and sophisticated attribution studies. For example, while it is clear that diseases have altered considerably in both wild animals and humans in some areas (high confidence in detection), there are many regions that are under-studied, and few regions that provide robust assessments of the role of climate change, particularly with respect to human infectious diseases. While wildfire has been robustly linked to climate change in some regions, there are still a lack of attribution studies in some regions that have experienced large burns recently, and only one fire impact—the increase of the area burned by wildfire in western North America in the period 1984–2017 (Section 2.4.4.2.1) —has been formally attributed to anthropogenic climate change. Global changes in soil and freshwater ecosystem carbon over time remain uncertainties in global carbon stocks and changes (Section 2.4.4.4); due to the physical inability to conduct repeat-monitoring and the lack of remote sensing to scale up point measurements, no global methods can yet produce repeating spatial estimates of soil carbon stock changes.Despite the growing understanding of the importance of ecosystem services, this assessment found limited research on the observed impacts of climate change for 14 of 18 ecosystem services (Table 2.1).
