Divergent responses to anthropogenic climate change are occurring within and across arid regions, depending on time period, location, detection methodology and vegetation type (see Cross-Chapter Paper 3). Emerging shifts in ecosystem structure, functioning and biodiversity are supported by evidence from modelled impacts of projected climate and CO2 levels. While observed responsiveness of arid vegetation productivity to rising atmospheric CO2 (Fensholt et al., 2012) may offset risks from reduced water availability (Fang et al., 2017), climate- and CO2-driven changes are key risks in arid regions, interacting with habitat degradation, wildfires and invasive species (Hurlbert et al., 2019).Widespread vegetation greening, as projected in AR4, is occurring in arid shrublands (Zhang et al., 2019a; Maestre et al., 2021) as a result of increases in leaf area, woody cover and herbaceous production at desert–grassland interfaces (Gonsamo et al., 2021). Plant productivity in arid regions has increased (Fensholt et al., 2012) because of improved water-use efficiency associated with elevated CO2 (Norby and Zak, 2011; Donohue et al., 2013; Burrell et al., 2020; Gonsamo et al., 2021) (medium evidence, high agreement ), altered rainfall seasonality and amount (Rohde et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019a ) (robust evidence, high agreement ), increases in temperature (Ratajczak et al., 2014; Wilcox et al., 2018) (robust evidence, high agreement ) and heavy grazing (robust evidence, high agreement ), with the relative importance differing across locations (Donohue et al., 2013; Caracciolo et al., 2016; Archer et al., 2017; Hoffmann et al., 2019b; Rohde et al., 2019). Woody-plant encroachment into arid shrublands is occurring with high confidence in North America (Caracciolo et al., 2016; Archer et al., 2017) and southern Africa (du Toit and O’Connor, 2014; Ward et al., 2014; Masubelele et al., 2015a; Hoffman et al., 2019; Rohde et al., 2019), and with low confidence in central Asia (Li et al., 2015). In North America, sagebrush steppe changes have been attributed to increases in temperature and earlier snowpack melt (USGCRP, 2017; Mote et al., 2018; Snyder et al., 2019).Non-native grasses are invading the sagebrush steppes (cold deserts) in North America (Chambers et al., 2014) attributed to warming (Bradley et al., 2016; Hufft and Zelikova, 2016). In the eastern semi-desert (Karoo) of South Africa, annual rainfall increases and a rainfall seasonality shift (du Toit and O’Connor, 2014) are increasing grassiness as arid grasslands expand into semi-desert shrublands (du Toit et al., 2015; Masubelele et al., 2015b; Masubelele et al., 2015a) causing fire in areas seldom burned historically (Coates et al., 2016).Interactions of drought, warming and land management have caused vegetation mortality (see Section 2.4.4.3) and reduced vegetation cover in shrublands, as projected by AR4 (Burrell et al., 2020). Increased heat and drought are causing the health and abundance of succulent species to decline (Musil et al., 2009; Schmiedel et al., 2012; Aragón-Gastélum et al., 2014; Koźmińska et al., 2019). Hot droughts, in particular, have been shown to reduce population resilience (Koźmińska et al., 2019).
