Temperature affects primary productivity by moderating phytoplankton growth rates, ice cover, thermal stratification and the length of growing seasons (Rühland et al., 2015; Richardson et al., 2018). Global warming has reinforced eutrophication, especially cyanobacteria blooms (Wagner and Adrian, 2009; Kosten et al., 2012; O’Neil et al., 2012; De Senerpont Domis et al., 2013; Adrian et al., 2016; Visser et al., 2016; Huisman et al., 2018) (very high confidence). Conversely ,  warming can reduce cyanobacteria in hypertrophic lakes (Richardson et al., 2019). Freshwater cyanobacteria may benefit directly from elevated CO2 concentrations (Visser et al., 2016; Ji et al., 2017; Huisman et al., 2018; Richardson et al., 2019).Macrophyte growth in freshwaters is likely to increase with rising water temperatures, atmospheric CO2 and precipitation (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Dhir, 2015; Hossain et al., 2016; Short et al., 2016; Reitsema et al., 2018). Nonetheless, primary productivity in rivers is variable and unpredictable (Bernhardt et al., 2018) because seasonal variations in temperature and light are uncorrelated, frequent high-flow events reduce biomass of autotrophs and droughts can strand and desiccate autotrophs.In large, nutrient-poor lakes, warming-induced prolonged thermal stratification can reduce primary production (medium confidence) (Kraemer et al., 2017). Warming may reduce phytoplankton concentrations when temperature-induced increases in consumption of phytoplankton outpace increases in phytoplankton production (De Senerpont Domis et al., 2013). These decreases in productivity may be under-recognised responses to climate change.Summary: There is robust  evidence of an increase in primary production along with warming trends. However, increases or declines of algae cannot entirely be attributed to climate change; they are lake-specific and modulated through weather conditions, lake morphology, salinity, land use and restoration and biotic interactions (medium confidence) (O’Beirne et al., 2017; Velthuis et al., 2017; Rusak et al., 2018; Ho et al., 2019).
