The difference between photosynthesis by plants (gross primary productivity, GPP) and plant energy use through respiration is the net growth of plants (NPP), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere and mitigates emissions from deforestation and other LUCs (Section 2.4.4.4). Global terrestrial NPP has exceeded emissions due to land use since the early 2000s, making terrestrial ecosystems a net carbon sink (Friedlingstein et al., 2020).Global terrestrial NPP increased by 6% from 1982 to 1999 through increased temperature and increased solar radiation in the Amazon from decreased cloud cover (Nemani et al., 2003), and then decreased 1% from 2000 to 2009, because of extensive droughts in the Southern Hemisphere (Zhao and Running, 2010). From 1999 to 2015, increased aridity caused extensive declines in the NDVI globally, particularly semiarid ecosystems (Huang et al., 2016), indicating widespread decreases in NPP (Yuan et al., 2019).Global terrestrial GPP increased 2% from 1951 to 2010 and continued increasing at least until 2016, with increased atmospheric CO2 showing a greater influence than natural factors (Li et al., 2017; Fernandez-Martinez et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019a; Cai and Prentice, 2020; Melnikova and Sasai, 2020). Global forest area increased 7% from 1982 to 2016, mainly from forest plantations and regrowth in boreal and temperate forests in Asia and Europe (Song et al., 2018); regrowth in secondary forests >20 years old, mainly in boreal, temperate and subtropical regions, generated a net removal of 7.7 Gt yr -1CO2 from the atmosphere from 2001 to 2019 (Harris et al., 2021). Vegetation growth that exceeds the modelled CO2 fertilisation, gaps in field data and incomplete knowledge of plant mortality and soil carbon responses introduce uncertainties into quantifying the magnitude of CO2 fertilisation (Walker et al., 2021). A combination of CO2 fertilisation of global vegetation and secondary forest regrowth has increased global vegetation productivity (medium evidence, medium agreement ).The relative increase in GPP per unit of increased atmospheric CO2 declined from 1982 to 2015, indicating a weakening of any CO2 fertilisation effect (Wang et al., 2020c). Increased growth from CO2 fertilisation has begun to shorten the lifespan of trees due to a trade-off between growth rate and longevity, based on analyses of tree rings of 110 species around the world (Brienen et al., 2020). Furthermore, water availability controls the magnitude of NPP (Beer et al., 2010; Jung et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2017), including water from precipitation (Beer et al., 2010), soil moisture (Stocker et al., 2019), groundwater storage (Humphrey et al., 2018; Madani et al., 2020a) and atmospheric vapour (Novick et al., 2016; Madani et al., 2020b). Drought stress reduced NPP across tropical forests from 2000 to 2015 (Zhang et al., 2019b) and GPP in the tropics from 1982 to 2016 (Madani et al., 2020b). Drought stress has also reduced GPP in some semiarid and arid lands (Huang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2019a). In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus constrain CO2 fertilisation (Terrer et al., 2019), although phosphorus limitation of tropical tree growth is species-specific (Alvarez-Clare et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2019). NPP has decreased during some time periods and in some regions where drought stress has exerted a greater influence than increased atmospheric CO2 (medium evidence, high agreement ).
