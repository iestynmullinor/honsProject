The ecosystem that attains the highest above-ground carbon density in the world is the coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forest in California, USA, with 2600 ± 100 tonnes ha -1 carbon (Van Pelt et al., 2016). The ecosystem with the second highest documented carbon density in the world is the mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forest in Victoria, Australia, with ~1900 tonnes ha -1 (Keith et al., 2009). In the Tropics, tropical evergreen broadleaf forests (rainforests) in the Amazon, the Congo and Indonesia attain the highest carbon densities, reaching a maximum of 230 tonnes ha -1 in the Amazon (Mitchard et al., 2014) and the Congo (Xu et al., 2017). Temperature increases reduce the tropical rainforest above-ground carbon density 9.1 tonnes ha -1 per degree Celsius, through reduced growth and increased tree mortality (Sullivan et al., 2020).Tropical forests contain the largest vegetation carbon stocks in the world, with 180–250 GtC above and below ground (Saatchi et al., 2011; Baccini et al., 2012; Avitabile et al., 2016). The Amazon contains a stock of 45–60 GtC (Baccini et al., 2012; Mitchard et al., 2014; Englund et al., 2017).Ecosystems with high soil carbon densities include the peat bogs in Ireland with up to 3000 tonnes ha -1 (Tomlinson, 2005), the Cuvette Centrale swamp forest peatlands in Congo with an average of ~2200 tonnes ha -1 (Dargie et al., 2017), the Arctic tundra with an average of ~900 tonnes ha -1 (Tarnocai et al., 2009) and the mangrove peatlands in Kalimantan, Indonesia, with an average of 850 ± 320 tonnes ha -1 (Murdiyarso et al., 2015). Arctic permafrost contains 1400 ± 200 GtC to a depth of 3 m, the largest soil carbon stock in the world (Hugelius et al., 2014). Globally, peatlands contain 470–620 GtC (Page et al., 2011; Hodgkins et al., 2018), of which boreal and temperate peatlands contain 415 ± 150 GtC (Hugelius et al., 2020) and tropical peatlands contain 80–350 GtC (Page et al., 2011; Dargie et al., 2017; Gumbricht et al., 2017; Ribeiro et al., 2021). Other analyses increase the upper estimates for boreal and temperate peatlands to 800–1200 GtC (Nichols and Peteet, 2019; Mishra et al., 2021b).Tropical forests and Arctic permafrost contain the highest ecosystem carbon stocks in above-ground vegetation and soil, respectively, in the world (robust evidence, high agreement ). These ecosystems form natural sinks that prevent the emission to the atmosphere of 1400–1800 GtC that would otherwise increase the magnitude of climate change (high confidence).
