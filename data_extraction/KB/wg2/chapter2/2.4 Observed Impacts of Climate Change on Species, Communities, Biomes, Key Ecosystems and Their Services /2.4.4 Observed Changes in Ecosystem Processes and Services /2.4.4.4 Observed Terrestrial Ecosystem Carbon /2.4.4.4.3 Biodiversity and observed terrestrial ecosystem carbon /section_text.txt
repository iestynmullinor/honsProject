High biodiversity and ecosystem carbon generally occur together, with rainforests in the Amazon, Congo and Indonesia containing the largest above-ground vegetation carbon stocks (Saatchi et al., 2011; Baccini et al., 2012; Avitabile et al., 2016) and the highest vascular plant species richness (Kreft and Jetz, 2007) in the world. Above-ground ecosystem carbon and animal species richness show high correlation but also high spatial variability (Strassburg et al., 2010). Above-ground carbon is correlated to genus richness globally (Cavanaugh et al., 2014), but to species richness only in local areas (Poorter et al., 2015; Sullivan et al., 2017). Species richness generally increases vegetation productivity in the humid tropics while tree abundance increases productivity in drier conditions (Madrigal-Gonzalez et al., 2020). Across the Amazon, ~1% of tree species contain 50% of the above-ground carbon, due to abundance and maximum height (Fauset et al., 2015). Above-ground carbon in tropical forests shows positive correlations to vertebrate species richness (P values not reported) (Deere et al., 2018; Di Marco et al., 2018). In logged and burned tropical forest in Brazil, species richness of plants, birds and beetles increased with carbon density up to ~100 tonnes ha -1 (Ferreira et al., 2018).National parks and other protected areas which, in June 2021, covered 15.7% of global terrestrial area (UNEP-WCMC et al., 2021) contain ~90 GtC in vegetation and ~150 GtC in soil (one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of global stocks) and remove carbon from the atmosphere at a rate of ~0.5 Gt yr -1 (one-sixth of global removals) (Melillo et al., 2016). The most strictly protected areas contain carbon at higher densities, but illegal deforestation and fires in some protected areas emit 38 Â± 17 Mt yr -1 globally (Collins and Mitchard, 2017). In the Amazon, protected areas store more than half of the above-ground vegetation carbon stocks of the region, but account for only one-tenth of net emissions (Walker et al., 2020). Conservation of high biodiversity areas, particularly in protected areas, protects ecosystem carbon, prevents emissions to the atmosphere and reduces the magnitude of climate change (high confidence).
