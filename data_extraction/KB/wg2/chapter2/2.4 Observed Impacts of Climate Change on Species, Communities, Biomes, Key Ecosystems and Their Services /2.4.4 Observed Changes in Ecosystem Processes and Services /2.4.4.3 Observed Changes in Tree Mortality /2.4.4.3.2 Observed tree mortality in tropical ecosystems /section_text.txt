In the Brazilian Amazon, deforestation to clear agricultural land comprises the principal cause of tree mortality, reducing forest cover by an average of 13,900 km 2 yr -1 from 1988 to 2020 (Assis et al., 2019). In addition, in a set of 310 Amazon field plots, an annual average temperature increase of 1.2°C from 1950 to 2018 (Marengo et al., 2018) contributed to tree mortality of ~40% from 1983 to 2011 (Brienen et al., 2015). In another set of plots, mortality among newly recruited trees of mesic genera increased and drought-tolerant genera became more abundant from 1985 to 2015 (Esquivel-Muelbert et al., 2019). In other plots, tree mortality did not show a statistically significant change from 1965 to 2016, but rose abruptly in severe drought years, mainly during warm phases of the ENSO (Aleixo et al., 2019). Nearly half the area of the Amazon has experienced extremely dry conditions during ENSO warm phases; this can cause extensive wildfire (Section 2.4.4.2.3). Wildfires can increase tree mortality rates by >600% above rates in non-burned areas, with the higher mortality persisting for up to a decade after a fire (Silva et al., 2018; Berenguer et al., 2021). Climate change has contributed to tree mortality in the Amazon rainforest (medium evidence, medium agreement ).In the African Sahel, field research has continued to detect tree mortality, ranging from 20 to 90% in the period 1965–2018 (Kusserow, 2017; Trichon et al., 2018; Dendoncker et al., 2020), and declines in tree biodiversity, with up to 80% local losses of tree species in the period 1970–2014 (Hanke et al., 2016; Kusserow, 2017; Ibrahim et al., 2018; Dendoncker et al., 2020), consistent with, but not formally attributed to, climate change. In Algeria, mortality of the Atlas cedar (Cedrus atlantica) increased from 1980 to 2006, coinciding with a ~1°C spring temperature increase, but non-climate factors were not examined (Navarro-Cerrillo et al., 2019). Across southern Africa, nine of the 13 oldest known (1100–2500 years old) baobab trees (Adansonia digitata) have died since 2005, although the causes are unknown (Patrut et al., 2018). In South Africa, savanna trees experienced an order of magnitude increase in mortality, related, but not formally attributed to, decreased rainfall (Case et al., 2019). In Tunisia, insect infestations related, but not formally attributed to, hotter temperatures led to mortality of cork oaks (Quercus suber) (Bellahirech et al., 2019).
