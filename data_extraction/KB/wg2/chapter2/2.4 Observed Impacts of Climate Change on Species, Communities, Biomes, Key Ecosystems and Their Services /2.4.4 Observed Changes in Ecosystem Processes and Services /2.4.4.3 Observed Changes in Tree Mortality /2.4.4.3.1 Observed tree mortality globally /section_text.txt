Anthropogenic climate change can cause tree mortality directly via increased aridity or drought (Section 2.4.4.3.3) or indirectly through wildfire (Section 2.4.4.2.1) and insect pests (Section 2.4.4.3.3). Catastrophic failure of the plant hydraulic system, in which a lack of water causes the xylem to lose hydraulic conductance, is the principal mechanism of drought-induced tree death (Anderegg et al., 2016; Adams et al., 2017; Anderegg et al., 2018; Choat et al., 2018; Menezes-Silva et al., 2019; Brodribb et al., 2020).Up through the AR5 (Settele et al., 2014), detection and attribution analyses had found that anthropogenic climate change, with global temperature increases of 0.3°C–0.9°C above the pre-industrial period and the increases in aridity exceeding the effects of local non-climate change factors, caused three cases of drought-induced tree mortality of up to 20% in the period 1945–2007 in western North America (van Mantgem et al., 2009), the African Sahel (Gonzalez et al., 2012) and North Africa (le Polain de Waroux and Lambin, 2012). Increased wildfire and pest infestations, driven by climate change, also contributed to North American tree mortality (van Mantgem et al., 2009). In addition, a meta-analysis of published cases found that drought consistent with, but not formally attributed to, climate change had caused tree mortality at 88 sites in boreal, temperate and tropical ecosystems (Allen et al., 2010), with 49 additional cases found by the AR5 (Settele et al., 2014).Since the AR5 (Settele et al., 2014), global meta-analyses found at least 15 (Allen et al., 2015) and 25 (Hartmann et al., 2018) additional sites, respectively, of drought-induced tree mortality around the world. These and other global analyses found more rapid mortality than previously (Allen et al., 2015), rising background mortality (Allen et al., 2015), mortality increasing with drought severity (Greenwood et al., 2017), mortality of tropical trees increasing with temperature (Locosselli et al., 2020), mortality increasing with tree size for many species (Bennett et al., 2015), mortality predominantly at the dry edge of species ranges (Anderegg et al., 2019) and three-quarters of drought-induced mortality cases leading to a change in the dominant species (Batllori et al., 2020). Multiple non-climate factors contribute to tree mortality, including timber cutting, livestock grazing and air pollution (Martinez-Vilalta and Lloret, 2016). Globally, tropical dry forests lost, from all causes, 95,000 km 2, 8% of their total area, from 1982 to 2016, the most extensive area of mortality of any biome (Song et al., 2018).In summary, anthropogenic climate change caused drought-induced tree mortality of up to 20% in the period 1945–2007 in western North America, the African Sahel and North Africa, via global temperature increases of 0.3°C–0.9°C above the pre-industrial period and increases in aridity, and it contributed to over 100 other cases of drought-induced tree mortality in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and North and South America (high confidence). Field observations document accelerating mortality rates, rising background mortality and post-mortality vegetation shifts (high confidence). Water stress, leading to plant hydraulic failure, is the principal mechanism of drought-induced tree mortality. Timber cutting, agricultural expansion, air pollution and other non-climate factors also contribute to tree death.
