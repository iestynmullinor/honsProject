A global meta-analysis of 59 studies encompassing 631 cases of animal abundance changes in areas of tree mortality over the past 7â€“59 years, primarly in North America and Australia, with a few sites in other regions (e.g. Europe). Overall, in areas with documented high tree mortality, bird abundances increased (n=186 bird species), there was no significant trend for mammals (n=33 species), a slight trend towards declines in invertebrates (n=28 species), and insufficient information to categorize the responses of reptiles (n=20 species). However, within groups, significant differences appeared. Mammals that use trees as refugia showed declines with tree mortality  (high confidence)  , but flying mammals (e.g. bats) increased  (medium confidence). Ground-nesting, ground-foraging, tree-hole nesting and bark-foraging birds increased most, but nectar-feeding and foliage-gleaning birds declined  (high confidence). Within invertebrates, declines were strongest in ground-foraging predators and detritivores  (medium confidence)  (Fleming et al., 2021).
