Physical changes in lakes (see Section 2.3.3) have affected primary production (see Section 2.4.4.5.2), algal-bloom formation and composition, zooplankton and fish size distribution, and species composition (Urrutia-Cordero et al., 2017; Gozlan et al., 2019; Seltmann et al., 2019). Declines in the abundance of cold-stenothermal species, particularly the Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), coregonids  and smelt, and increases in eurythermal fish (e.g., the thermo-tolerant carp Cyprinus carpio, common bream, pike perch, roach and shad) have been observed in northern temperate lakes associated with warming trends (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Jeppesen et al., 2012; Jeppesen et al., 2014). These changes increase predation pressure on zooplankton and reduce grazing pressure on phytoplankton, which may result in higher phytoplankton biomass (De Senerpont Domis et al., 2013; Jeppesen et al., 2014; Adrian et al., 2016). Reduction in lake mixing lowers the concentration of nutrients in the epilimnion and may lead to higher silicon-to-phosphorous ratios that negatively affect diatom growth (Yankova et al., 2017) or overall primary productivity (see Section 2.4.4.5.2).In a study of 1567 lakes across Europe and North America, Kakouei (2021) identified climate change as the major driver of increases in phytoplankton biomass in remote areas with minimal LULCC. Greater temperature variability can be more important than long-term temperature trends as a driver of zooplankton biodiversity (Shurin et al., 2010). Reductions of winter severity attributed to anthropogenic climate change are increasing winter algal biomass, and motile and phototropic species, at the expense of mixotrophic species (Özkundakci et al., 2016; Hampton et al., 2017).Tropical lakes are prone to loss of deep-water oxygen due to lake warming, with negative consequences for their fisheries and their biodiversity (Lewis Jr, 2000; Van Bocxlaer et al., 2012). Many ancient tropical lakes (Malawi, Tanganyika, Victoria, Titicaca, Towuti and Matano) hold thousands of endemic animal species (Vadeboncoeur et al., 2011).Observed effects of climate change on freshwater invertebrates are variable (Knouft and Ficklin, 2017). In glacier-fed streams globally, climate change has caused community turnover and changes in abundances in terms of increased generalist and decreased specialist species (Lencioni, 2018; Cauvy-Fraunié and Dangles, 2019). In turn, dragonflies in flowing waters, monitored during the warming period from 1988 through 2006 in Europe, did not show consistent changes in their distribution (Grewe et al., 2013), reviewed in Knouft and Ficklin (2017). Long-term trends in the species composition and community structure of stream macro-invertebrates, specifically a general trend for decreases in species characteristic of cold, fast-flowing waters and increases of thermophilic species typical of stagnant or slow-moving waters, have been attributed to climate change (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Daufresne et al., 2007; Chessman, 2015). A study of 14 geothermal streams reported simplified food web structures and shortened pathways of energy flux between consumers and resources (O’Gorman et al., 2019). Macrophytes benefit from rising water temperatures, but increased shading from increased phytoplankton biomass could offset this (Hossain et al., 2016; Short et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017a).
