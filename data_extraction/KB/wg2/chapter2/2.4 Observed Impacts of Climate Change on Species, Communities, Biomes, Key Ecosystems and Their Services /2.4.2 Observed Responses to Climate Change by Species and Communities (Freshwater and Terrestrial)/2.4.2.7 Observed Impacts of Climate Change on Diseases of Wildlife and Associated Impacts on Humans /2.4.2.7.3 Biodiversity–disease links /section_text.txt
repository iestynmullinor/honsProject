Anthropogenic impacts, such as disturbances caused by climate change, can reduce biodiversity via multiple mechanisms and increase the risk of human diseases (limited evidence, low agreement ),  but more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms (Civitello et al., 2015; Young et al., 2017b; Halliday et al., 2020; Rohr et al., 2020; Glidden et al., 2021). Known wildlife hosts of human-shared pathogens and parasites overall comprise a greater proportion of local species richness (18–72% higher) and abundance (21–144% higher) at sites under substantial human use (agricultural and urban land) compared with nearby undisturbed habitats (Gibb et al., 2020).Exploitation of wildlife and degradation of natural habitats have increased opportunities for a ‘spill over’ of pathogens from wildlife to human populations and also the emergence of zoonotic disease epidemics and pandemics (robust evidence, high agreement ); animal and human migrations driven by climate change have added to this increased risk (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (see Section 2.4.2.1, Chapter 8, Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE in Chapter 5) (Patz et al., 2004; Cleaveland et al., 2007; Karesh et al., 2012; Altizer et al., 2013; Allen et al., 2017; Plowright et al., 2017; Faust et al., 2018; Carlson et al., 2020; Gibb et al., 2020; Hockings et al., 2020; IPBES, 2020; Volpato et al., 2020; Glidden et al., 2021). Agricultural losses and subsequent food scarcity, increasing due to climate change, can also lead to an increase in the use of bushmeat, and thus increase the risk of diseases jumping from wild animals to humans (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Brashares et al., 2004; Leroy et al., 2004; Wolfe et al., 2004; Rosen and Smith, 2010; Kurpiers et al., 2016).
