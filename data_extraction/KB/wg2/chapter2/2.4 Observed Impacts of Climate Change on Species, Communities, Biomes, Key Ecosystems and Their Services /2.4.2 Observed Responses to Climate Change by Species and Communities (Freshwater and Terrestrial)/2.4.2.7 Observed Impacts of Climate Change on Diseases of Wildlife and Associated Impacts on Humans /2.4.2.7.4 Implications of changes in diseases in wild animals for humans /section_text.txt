Changes in temperature, precipitation, humidity and extreme events have been associated with more frequent disease outbreaks, increases in disease incidence and severity, novel diseases and the emergence of vectors in new areas for wild animals, with a mechanistic understanding of the roles of these drivers from experimental studies providing high confidence for the role of climate change. However, attributing how this has impacted human infectious diseases remains difficult, and definitive attribution studies are lacking. The specific role of recent climate change is difficult to examine in isolation in most regions where human disease incidence has also been affected by LUC (particularly agricultural and urban expansion), changes in public health access and measures, socioeconomic changes, increased global movement of people and changes in vector and rodent control programs, supporting medium confidence in the role of climate change driving the observed changes in vector-borne and infectious human diseases globally. Exceptions are in areas noted above (the Arctic, sub-Arctic, and high-elevation regions), in which climate change fingerprints are strong and concurrent changes in non-climatic drivers are less pronounced than in other regions (high confidence for climate change attribution) (see Table SM2.1, Sections 5.5.1.3, 7.2.2.1, Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS this Chapter) (Harvell et al., 2002; Norwegian Polar Institute, 2009; Tersago et al., 2009; Tabachnick, 2010; Altizer et al., 2013; Garrett et al., 2013; Paz, 2015; Wu et al., 2016b; Caminade et al., 2019; Dewage et al., 2019; Coates and Norton, 2020; Deksne et al., 2020; Shocket et al., 2020; Couper et al., 2021; Gilbert, 2021).
