Since AR5, the number of studies of changes in phenology (timing of biological events) has increased substantially, aided by advances in remote sensing (Piao et al., 2019). Phenological studies have documented particularly consistent conclusions on responses of plants and animals to warming, including the advancement of spring events and the lengthening of growing seasons in temperate regions (via a combination of advancement of spring events and, to a lesser extent, the retardation of autumn events) (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Table 2.2, Table 2.3, Table SM2.1) (Menzel et al., 2020). In the Tropics, by contrast, changes in precipitation have more strongly influenced animal phenology than have temperature changes (Cohen et al., 2018). A meta-analysis compared observed phenological advances in birds with expectations due to warming local climates, and concluded that the observed advances fell short of what was expected and that a substantial phenological climate debt had been generated (Radchuk et al., 2019).Taxonomic groups have differed in their responses (Parmesan, 2007; Thackeray et al., 2010), and a few have completely diverged from general trends. For example, seabirds continue to breed with their pre-climate-change phenologies (Keogan et al., 2018). Newer reviews and analyses reveal differences in responses across continents and time intervals (Piao et al., 2019). Mean advance in days per decade for plants was 5.5 in China and 3.0–4.2 in Europe, but only 0.9 in North America (Piao et al., 2019). Mean values for the retardation of autumn leaf fall, which can be more influenced by photoperiod and less by temperature than spring leaf-out, were 0.36 days per decade in Europe (Menzel et al., 2020), 2.6 days per decade in China and around 3 days per decade in the USA (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Piao et al., 2019).The rapid rate of the advancement of spring events in the 1990s slowed down in the 2000s, and stalled or even reversed in some regions (Menzel et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2019) noted, from remote sensing, that during the ‘global warming hiatus’ from 1998 to 2012, there were no global trends in either spring green-up or autumn colouring. Annual crops, the timing of which is determined by farmers, were an exception. When natural systems were advancing fast prior to 1998, farmers advanced more slowly, but during the natural ‘hiatus’, farmed crops advanced faster than wild plants and cultivated trees (Menzel et al., 2020). In a long (67 years) European time series (Menzel et al., 2020), autumn leaf colouring showed delays attributed to winter and spring warming in 57% of observations (mean delay of 0.36 days per decade); spring and summer phenologies advanced in 89% of wild plants, despite decreased winter chilling, with around 60% of trends significant and ‘strongly attributable’ to winter and spring warming; and the growing season lengthened in 84% of cases (mean lengthening 0.26 days yr -1) (Table 2.2).Table 2.2 | Global fingerprints of climate change impacts across wild species. (Updated from (Parmesan and Hanley, 2015). For each study for which data were made available, a response for an individual species or functional group was classified as (1) no response (i.e., no significant change in the measured trait over time), (2) if a significant change was found, the response was classified as either consistent or not consistent with expectations according to local or regional climate trends. Percentages are approximate and estimated for the studies as a whole. Individual analyses within the studies may differ. The specific metrics of climate change analysed for associations with biological change vary somewhat across studies, but most use changes in local or regional temperatures (e.g., mean monthly T or mean annual T), with some using precipitation metrics (e.g., total annual rainfall). For example, a consistent response would be poleward range shifts in areas that are warming. Probability (P) of getting the observed ratio of consistent-to-not consistent responses by chance was <10–13 for (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003; Root et al., 2003; Root et al., 2005; Poloczanska et al., 2013) and <0.001 for Rosenzweig et al. (2008). The last collumn distinguishes studies that were designed for attribution to climate change (e.g. by analysing only long-term data from relatively undisturbed habitats (see section 2.1.3 and 2.4.1)(Parmesan et al., 2013; Cramer et al., 2014) from those that analysed all available data, including data from areas highly-impacted by non-climate drivers (e.g. LULCC).StudyN: total numbers of species, functional groups or studiesSpecies in given system: Terrestrial (T) Marine (M) Freshwater (F)  Types of changeChanges documentedGeographical regionStudy allows for attribution to climate change2.2a Observed phenological changes(Parmesan and Yohe, 2003)677 speciesT: 461 plants, 168 birds, 35 insects; T/F: 9 amphibians; F: 2 fishSpring phenologyOverall: 9% delay; 27% no trend; 62% advanceMean change 2.3 days per decade advanceGlobalYes(Menzel et al., 2006)Agricultural crops, fruit trees, wild plants100% TSpring and autumn phenologyFrom 1971 to 2000, 48% responding as expected; spring advance 2.5 days per decade, mean autumn delay 0.2 days per decade, fruit ripening 2.4 days per decade advance; farming activities 0.4 days per decade advanceEuropeYes(Parmesan, 2007)203 speciesT, FSpring phenologyOverall advance 2.8 days per decade20 changes (delays), 153 advances, 8 no change; significantly more advance at higher latitudesGlobalYes(Rosenzweig et al., 2008)55 studies (~100–200 species)T: 65%M: 13%F: 22%Various90% of changes consistent with local/regional climate changeGlobalYes(Thackeray et al., 2010)726 taxaT: birds, moths, aphids, terrestrial plants; M and F: phytoplanktonSpring phenology83.5% of ‘trends’ were advances; mean overall advance 3.9 days per decade; T plants 93% advancing, mean 5.8 days per decade; F plants 62% advancing, mean 2.3 days per decade; secondary consumers advanced less than primary consumers and producersUKNo(While and Uller, 2014)59 populations, 17 studiesT/F, 100% AmphibiansPhenology35% statistically significant change; mean advance 6.1 ± 1.65 days per decade; range 17.5 days delay to 41.9 days advance; 65% (n= 47 populations) found significant relationship between breeding phenology and temperature; higher latitudes advanced moreGlobalNo(Gill et al., 2015)64 studiesT: 100%treesDelay of autumn senescenceDelay averaged 0.33 days yr -1 and 1.20 days per degree Celsius warming; more delay at low latitudes across Northern Hemisphere; high-latitude species driven more by photoperiod than low-latitude speciesGlobalNo(Ficetola and Maiorano, 2016)66 studies of temperature effects;15 of precipitationT/F 100% amphibiansPhenology and abundancesPopulation dynamics driven by precipitation while breeding phenology driven by temperatureGlobalNo(Halupka and Halupka, 2017)28 species multi-brooded, 27 species single-brooded, some species several populationsT 100% (birds)Phenology: length of breeding seasonShows differences in sign of response between single and multi-broods and migrants vs. residents; Season extended by 4 days per decade for multi-brooded, shortened by 2 days per decade for single-brooded;Multi: 26 species; 15 of 34 populations significantly extended, none significantly reducedNorthern HemisphereYes(Kharouba et al., 2018)88 species in 54 pair-wise interactionsT: changes in relative phenologies of consumers and their resourcesAsynchrony between consumers and resources has increased in some cases and decreased in others, with no significant trend; the prediction that asynchronies should be increasing in general is not supported.GlobalNo(Cohen et al., 2018)127 studiesT: 100% animalsPhenological trends81% of 127 studies of animals show phenological change in direction of earlier spring; some studies were multi-species.Mean advance since 1950: 2.88 days per decade.EuropeNorth AmericaAustraliaJapanNo(Keogan et al., 2018)145 populations, 209 time seriesT: Seabirds breeding sitesPhenological trendsNo change in breeding dates between 1952 and 2015GlobalYes(Radchuk et al., 2019)4835 studies, 1413 speciesT: animals; T/F amphibiansPhenological trendsGreatest phenological advancements in amphibians, followed by insects and birds, in this order.Global but most in Northern HemisphereNo(Piao et al., 2019)ReviewT: PlantsSpring and autumn phenologiesRate of advance slowing down across Northern Hemisphere and reversed in parts of western North America in response to regional cooling since 1980sGlobalNo(Menzel et al., 2020)53 species in Germany, 37 in Austria, 21 in Switzerland (includes overlaps)T: PlantsSpring and autumn phenologiesLong time series: 1951–2018.

In temperate regions, sites with local extinction had greater increases in maximum temperature than those without (0.456°C vs. 0.153°C, P < 0.001, n= 505 sites) and smaller increases in mean temperatures (0.412°C vs. 1.231°C, P < 0.001). In tropical regions, range edges with local extinction also had greater increases in maximum temperatures (0.316°C vs. 0.061°C, P < 0.001, n= 76), but changes in mean temperatures were similar between edges with and without extinctions (0.415°C vs. 0.406°C, P = 0.9)GlobalYesChanges in freshwater systems are consistent with changes in terrestrial systems: earlier development of phytoplankton and zooplankton and earlier spawning by fish in spring as well as extension of the growing season are occurring (robust evidence, high agreement ) (Adrian et al., 2009; De Senerpont Domis et al., 2013; Adrian et al., 2016; Thackeray et al., 2016). Phenological changes in lakes have been related to rising water temperatures, reduced ice cover and prolonged thermal stratification (increasing evidence and agreement since AR5; very high confidence). Crozier and Hutchings (2014) reviewed the phenological changes in fish and documented that changes in the timing of migration and reproduction, age at maturity, age at juvenile migration, growth, survival and fecundity were associated primarily with changes in temperature. The median return time of Atlantic salmon to rivers in Newfoundland and Labrador advanced by 12–21 days over the past decades, associated with overall warmer conditions (Dempson et al., 2017).
