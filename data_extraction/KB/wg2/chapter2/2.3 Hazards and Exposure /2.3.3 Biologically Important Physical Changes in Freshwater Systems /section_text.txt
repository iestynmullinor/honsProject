Given the strength of relationship between past GSAT and warming trends at lake surfaces (Figure 2.2; Section 2.3.3.1) and projected increases in heat waves, surface water temperatures are projected to continue to increase (Woolway et al., 2021). Mean May to October lake surface temperatures in 46,557 European lakes were projected to be 2.9°C, 4.5°C and 6.5°C warmer by 2081–2099 compared to the historic period (1981–1999) under RCP2.0, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, respectively (Woolway et al., 2020a). Under RCP2.6, the average intensity of lake heat waves increases from 3.7°C to 4.0°C and the average duration from 7.7 to 27.0 days, relative to the historic period (1970–1999). For RCP8.5, warming increases to 5.4°C and duration increases dramatically to 95.5 days (medium confidence) (Woolway et al., 2021).Worldwide alterations in lake mixing regimes in response to climate change are projected (Kirillin, 2010). Most prominently, monomictic lakes—undergoing one mixing event in most years—will become permanently stratified, while lakes that are currently dimictic—mixing twice per year—will become monomictic by 2080–2100 (medium confidence) (Woolway and Merchant, 2019). Nevertheless, predicting mixing behaviour remains an important challenge and attribution to climate change remains difficult (Schwefel et al., 2016; Bruce et al., 2018).Under climate projections of 3.2°C warming, 4.6% of the ice-covered lakes in the Northern Hemisphere could switch to intermittent winter ice cover (Figure 2.4a; (Sharma et al., 2019). Unfrozen and warmer lakes lose more water to evaporation (Wang et al., 2018b). By 2100, global annual lake evaporation will increase by 16%, relative to 2006–2015, under RCP8.5 (Woolway et al., 2020b). Moreover, melting of ice decreases the ratio of sensible to latent heat flux, thus channelling more energy into evaporation (medium confidence) (Wang et al., 2018b). In the periods 2009–2029 and 2080–2100, average duration of river ice is projected to decline by 7.3 and 16.7 days under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Figure 2.4b; Yang et al., 2020).Projections of lake water storage are limited by the absence of reliable, long-term, homogenous and spatially resolved hydrologic observations (Hegerl et al., 2015). This uncertainty is reflected in the widely divergent projections in response to future climate changes in individual lakes (Angel and Kunkel, 2010; MacKay and Seglenieks, 2012; Malsy et al., 2012; Notaro et al., 2015) . Selecting models that perform well when comparing hindcasted to observed past water storage variation often does little to reduce water storage projection uncertainty (Angel and Kunkel, 2010). This wide range of potential changes complicates lake management. For information on observed and projected changes in the global water cycle and hydrological regimes for streams, lakes, wetland, groundwater and their implications on water quality and societies, see Chapter 4, this report, and (Douville et al., 2021). For the role of weather and climate extremes on the global water cycle, see (Seneviratne et al., 2021).In summary, with ongoing climate warming and an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, observed increases in water temperature, losses of ice and shifts in thermal regime are projected to continue (high confidence).
