AR5 noted that whether migration is adaptive or maladaptive depends on the context and the individuals involved; however, it did not focus specifically on hydrological change-induced migration (Noble et al., 2014). Migration is often regarded as a transformational adaptation strategy in response to climate-induced hydrological changes (Gemenne and Blocher, 2017) but rarely as the primary or only adaptation measure (Wiederkehr et al., 2018; de Longueville et al., 2020; Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). Migration is among one of the top five adaptation responses documented in Asia and Africa (Figure 4.27) and confers several benefits to migrants, yet maladaptations are also documented (Figure 4.29). This strategy is not available to everyone. Vulnerable populations exposed to hydrological changes may become trapped due to a lack of economic and social capital required for migration (Adams, 2016; Zickgraf, 2018) (medium confidence).Spontaneous migration, undertaken without outside assistance, has shown the potential to improve the resilience of migrants and communities (Call et al., 2017; Jha et al., 2018a), but may also lead to increased vulnerability and insecurity in some instances (Adger et al., 2018; Linke et al., 2018a; Singh and Basu, 2020). Migration is not a viable strategy for everyone, but age, gender and socioeconomic status play a significant role in encouraging or inhibiting the chances of successful migration (Maharjan et al., 2020; Bergmann et al., 2021; Erwin et al., 2021). Migration has increased vulnerability among women and female-headed households (Patel and Giri, 2019), but has also triggered gender-positive processes such as increased female school enrolment (Gioli et al., 2014) (medium confidence). Remittances, that is, transfers of money from migrants to beneficiaries in sending areas, may reduce vulnerability and increase adaptive capacity to climate-induced hydrological changes (Ng’ang’a et al., 2016; Jha et al., 2018b) (medium confidence). Managed retreat refers to the planned and assisted moving of people and assets away from risk areas, such as government- or community-led resettlement (Hino et al., 2017; Maldonado and Peterson, 2018; Tadgell et al., 2018; Arnall, 2019). Such initiatives may reduce exposure to risk (Lei et al., 2017). However, they often fail to include affected populations in the process and may lead to greater impoverishment and increased vulnerability (Wilmsen and Webber, 2015) (medium confidence).More research on how to ensure migration becomes a successful adaptation strategy is needed (McLeman et al., 2016). In addition, impacts on women, youth and marginalised groups (McLeman et al., 2016; Miletto, 2017) and immobility issues need more attention (Zickgraf, 2018).In summary, measures that facilitate successful migration and inclusive resettlement may facilitate adaptation to climate-induced hydrological changes (medium confidence).
