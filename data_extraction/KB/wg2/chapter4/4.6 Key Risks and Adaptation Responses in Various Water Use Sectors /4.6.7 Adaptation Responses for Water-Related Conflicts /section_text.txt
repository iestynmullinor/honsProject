AR5 concluded with high confidence that challenges for adaptation actions (though not water) are particularly high in regions affected by conflicts (Field et al., 2014a). Although climate–conflict linkages are disputed (Section 4.3.6), the potential for synergies between conflict risk reduction and adaptation to climate change exists (Mach et al., 2019). For example, discourses around climate–conflict inter-linkages can present opportunities for peace building and cooperation (Matthew, 2014; Abrahams, 2020). Indeed, adaptation efforts are needed in the context of conflict, where the pre-existing vulnerability undermines the capacity to manage climatic stresses. In addition, adaptive capacity depends on contextual factors such as power relations and historical, ethnic tensions (Petersen-Perlman et al., 2017; Eriksen et al., 2021), which need to be adequately considered in the design of adaptation strategies.Some adaptation options, such as water conservation, storage and infrastructure, voluntary migration, planned relocation due to flood risk/sea level rise, and international water treaties, can reduce vulnerability to climate change and conflicts. However, on the other hand, these adaptation options sometimes may have unintended consequences by increasing existing tensions (Milman and Arsano, 2014); displacing climate hazards to more vulnerable and marginalised groups (Milman and Arsano, 2014; Mach et al., 2019), for example, pastoralists (Zografos et al., 2014); and favouring some over others, such as industry over agriculture (Iglesias and Garrote, 2015)¸ upstream countries over downstream countries (Veldkamp et al., 2017), and men over women (Chandra et al., 2017). Such unintended consequences may happen when adaptation measures intended to reduce vulnerability produce maladaptive outcomes by rebounding or shifting vulnerability to other actors (Juhola et al., 2016). For example, in the Mekong River basin, the construction of dams and water reservoirs contributes to the adaptation efforts of the upstream Southeast Asia countries while increasing current/future vulnerability to floods and droughts in downstream countries and can emerge as a cause of conflict (Earle et al., 2015; Ngô et al., 2016).Furthermore, adaptation in the context of water-related conflicts is also constrained by economic, institutional and political factors, competition for development (Anguelovski et al., 2014) and gender considerations (Sultana, 2014; Chandra et al., 2017), which need to be taken into account when designing adaptation plans/measures.
