AR5 concluded that some adaptation responses in the urban and agricultural sectors could negatively impact freshwater ecosystems (medium confidence) (Settele et al., 2014).Adaptation measures to cope with changes in ecosystems, including freshwater ecosystems, such as ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) interventions have gained wide recognition at the global policy level (Reid, 2016; Barkdull and Harris, 2019; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2019b).These have been implemented in many locations around the world, yet, challenges remain, including improving the evidence base of their effectiveness, scaling up of these interventions, mainstreaming across sectors and receiving more adaptation finance (medium confidence).A systematic review of 132 academic papers and 32 articles from non-peer-reviewed literature (Doswald et al., 2014) provided a comprehensive global overview of EbA, which showed that EbA interventions were used in various ecosystems, including inland wetlands (linked to 30 publications). An investigation of EbA effectiveness by Reid et al. (2019), where nine case studies covering South Asia, Africa and South America were associated with freshwater systems, concluded that EbA enabled the enhancement of the adaptive capacity or resilience to climate change, particularly for the more vulnerable groups in the community. An assessment of the potential for EbA in three sub-basins of the Murrayâ€“Darling Basin, Australia, concluded that EbA can augment catchment management practices but that there were also institutional challenges (Lukasiewicz et al., 2016). In urban settings, EbA has been associated with ecological structures for reducing risks, including the use of urban wetlands (Barkdull and Harris, 2019). EbA is a subset of NbS that is rooted in climate change adaptation and covers both mitigation and adaptation (Pauleit et al., 2017) (Section 4.6.5, Box 4.6). Although adaptation measures for freshwater ecosystems have been implemented in many places (Shaw et al., 2014; Lukasiewicz et al., 2016; Karim and Thiel, 2017; Milman and Jagannathan, 2017; FAO, 2018a; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2019b), the evidence base for the effectiveness of these measures to cope with changes in freshwater ecosystems needs improvement. These measures also require further financial support, mainstreaming across sectors and the scaling up of individual measures (medium confidence).In summary, adaptation measures to cope with changes in freshwater ecosystems have been implemented in many locations around the world. However, challenges remain, including improving the evidence base of their effectiveness, scaling up these interventions, mainstreaming across sectors and receiving more adaptation finance (medium confidence).
