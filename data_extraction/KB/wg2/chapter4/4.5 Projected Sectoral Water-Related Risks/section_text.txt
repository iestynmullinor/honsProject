AR5 found that climate change will threaten cultural practices and values, although the risks vary across societies and over time (medium evidence, high agreement ). Furthermore, AR5 concluded that significant changes in the natural resource base on which many cultures depend would directly affect the cultural core, worldviews, cosmologies and symbols of indigenous cultures (Adger and Pulhin, 2014). SR1.5 concluded with high confidence that limiting global warming to 1.5°C, rather than 2°C, will strongly benefit terrestrial and wetland ecosystems and their services, including the cultural services provided by these ecosystems (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). SROCC found with high confidence that cultural assets are projected to be negatively affected by future cryospheric and associated hydrological changes (Hock et al., 2019b).There is high confidence that the cultural water uses of Indigenous Peoples, local communities and traditional peoples are at risk of climate change-related hydrological change (Table 4.7). Climate-driven variations in streamflow, saltwater intrusion and projected increases in water temperature will exacerbate declines of culturally important species and lead to variations or depletion of culturally important places and subsistence practices. For example, in New Zealand, the increasing risk of flood events may impact culturally important fish species for Mā ori (Carter, 2019), while habitat changes may shift the distribution of culturally significant plants (Bond et al., 2019). In Australia, Yuibera and Koinmerburra Traditional Owners fear the saltwater inundation of culturally significant sites and waterholes (Lyons et al., 2019), while the flooding of culturally significant wetlands will negatively affect the Lumbee Tribe (USA) (Emanuel, 2018). Moreover, changes in the carrying capacity of ice, snow quality and formation will probably increase the physical risks to Saami practising reindeer herding (Jaakkola et al., 2018).Table 4.7 |  Selected projected risks to Indigenous Peoples’ uses of water.RegionIndigenous PeopleClimate hazardWater-related riskSituated knowledgeReferenceAsiaIfugaoIncreased temperatures; increasing rainfall (wet season); decreasing rainfall (dry season)Flooding (wet season); water deficit (dry season)Increases in future wet season rainfall pose increase risks of excess surface water runoff and potential for soil erosion, which may cause the collapse of Ifugao rice terraces. Reductions in future dry season rainfall and warmer temperatures indicate significant water deficits during the growing season of local tinawon rice.Soriano and Herath (2020)AustralasiaYuibera and Koinmerburra Traditional Owner groupsSea-level riseFloodingCulturally important coastal waterholes, wetlands and sites are at risk of saltwater inundation due to rising sea levels. If inundated, Traditional Owners may not be able to maintain cultural connections to these important sites (11.4.1).Lyons (2019)AustralasiaMā oriIncreased precipitationFloodingIncreasing flood events may negatively impact spawning and fishing sites of the culturally important īnaka (whitebait; Galaxias maculates) in the Waikōuaiti River (11.4.2).Carter (2019)AustralasiaMā oriIncreased temperature; precipitation variabilityEcosystemchangeChanges in temperature and precipitation are projected to shift the range of wetland plants (Kūmarahou and Kuta) in New Zealand, which may decrease access to these culturally significant species, which are used for medicinal and weaving purposes. The changing distribution of these plants may lead to a loss of Indigenous knowledge and affect inter-tribal reciprocity and gifting practices (11.4.2).Bond et al. (2019)Central and South AmericaWaraoSea level riseFloodingThe partial or total inundation of the Orinoco Delta will result in the loss of freshwater wetlands and species, which will produce rapid shifts in the culturally significant lands and resources of the Warao. Among the affected species is the Mauritia  palm, on which Warao culture and livelihoods are based.Vegas-Vilarrúbia et al. (2015)EuropeSaamiIncreased temperatures; changes in precipitationWinter thawReindeer herding is culturally important for Saami and provides a means to maintain traditions, language and cultural identity, thus constituting an essential part of Saami physical and mental well-being. More frequent ice formation on soil and snow, which will reduce the availability and quality of winter forage for reindeer, will negatively impact reindeer herding and thus Saami identity and well-being (13.8.1.2).Jaakkola et al. (2018); (Markkula et al. (2019)North AmericaLumbee TribeIncreased temperatures; increased rainfall variabilityFloodingClimate-related degradation and flooding of wetlands and streams in the Lumbee River watershed will negatively affect cultural practices of fishing and harvesting that rely on access to and resources obtained from the area.Emanuel (2018)Further research is necessary to assess the extent and nature of climate-driven risks to cultural water uses in the context of broader socioeconomic, cultural and political challenges facing diverse Indigenous Peoples and local and traditional communities. In addition, given the significance of IKLK to adaptive capacity and community-led adaptation, the potential risks of climate-related hydrological changes to diverse cultural water uses warrant closer study (Sections 4.6.9, 4.8.4, Cross-Chapter Box INDIG in Chapter 18).In sum, there is high confidence that climate-driven hydrological changes to cultural water uses and culturally significant ecosystems and species are projected to pose risks to the physical well-being of Indigenous Peoples, local communities and traditional peoples.
