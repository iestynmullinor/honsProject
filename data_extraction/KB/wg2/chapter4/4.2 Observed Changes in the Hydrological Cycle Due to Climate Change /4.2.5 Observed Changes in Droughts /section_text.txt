There are different types of droughts, and they are interconnected in terms of processes (Douville et al., 2021). Meteorological droughts (periods of persistent low precipitation) propagate over time into deficits in soil moisture, streamflow and water storage, leading to a reduction in water supply (hydrological drought ). Increased atmospheric evaporative demand increases plant water stress, leading to agricultural and ecological drought. Hydrological drought can result in shortages of drinking water and cause substantial economic damages. Agricultural drought threatens food production through crop damage and yield decreases (e.g., Section 4.3.1) (high confidence) and consequent economic impacts (Table 4.4). For example, drought in India in 2014 was reported to have led to an estimated USD 30 billion in losses (Ward and Makhija, 2018). Ecological drought increases the risks of wildfire (Table 4.4). Cascading effects of droughts can include health issues triggered by a lack of sanitation (Section 4.3.3); can cause human displacements and loss of social ties, sense of place and cultural identity; and migration to unsafe settlements (medium confidence) (Serdeczny et al., 2017) (Section 4.3.7). Between 1970 and 2019, only 7% of all disaster events were drought-related, yet they contributed disproportionately to 34% of disaster-related death, mostly in Africa (WMO, 2021). Nevertheless, IK, TK and LK have increased drought resilience among crop and livestock farmers, for example, in South Africa (Muyambo et al., 2017), Uganda (Mfitumukiza et al., 2020) and India (Patel et al., 2020) (Section 4.8.4).Table 4.4 |  Selected major drought events from 2013 to 2020 and their societal impact. Studies were selected for presentation based on the availability scientific literature impacts information and do not necessarily represent the most severe events.Impactful events are included even if not found to have a component attributable to climate change. This is not a systematic assessment of event attributions studies and their physical science conclusions. ‘Sign of influence’ indicates whether anthropogenic climate change was found to have made the event more or less likely , and ‘mechanism/magnitude of influence’ quantifies the change in likelihood and the processes or quantities involved.YearCountry/regionImpactInfluence of anthropogenic climate change on the likelihood of an eventReferenceSign of influenceMechanism/magnitude of influence2019/2020AustraliaWildfires burning ~97,000 km 2 across southern and eastern Australia; 34 human fatalities; 5900 buildings destroyed; millions of people affected by hazardous air quality; between 0.5 and 1.5 billion wild animals and tens of thousands of livestock killed; at least 30% of habitat affected for seventy taxa, including 21 already listed as threatened with extinction, over USD 110 billion financial lossIncreaseExtreme high temperatures causing drying of fuel.

(2015)2014Southern Levant, SyriaWhile the extent to which the 2007/2008 drought in the Levant region destabilised the Syrian government was not clear, ‘there is no questioning the enormous toll this extreme event took on the region’s population. The movement of refugees from both the drought and war-affected regions into Jordan and Lebanon ensured that the anomalously low precipitation in the winter of 2013/2014 amplified impacts on already complex water and food provisions.’IncreaseThe persistent drought in the 2014 rainy seasonwas unprecedented for the critical January–February period in the observationalrecord, and was made ~45% more likely by anthropogenic climate change.Bergaoui et al.

(2018)When hazard, vulnerability and exposure are considered together, drought risk is lower for sparsely populated regions, such as tundra and tropical forests, and higher for populated areas and intensive crop and livestock farming regions, such as southern and central Asia, southeastern South America, central Europe and the southeastern USA (Figure 4.9). Dynamics in exposure and vulnerability are rarely addressed (Jurgilevich et al., 2017; Hagenlocher et al., 2019). Quantifying economic vulnerability to drought in terms of damages as a percentage of exposed GDP, Formetta and Feyen (2019) show a disproportionate burden of drought impact on low-income countries, but with a clear decrease in global economic drought vulnerability between 1980–1989 and 2007–2016, including a convergence between lower-income and higher-income countries due to stronger vulnerability reduction in less-developed countries. Nevertheless, during 2007–2016, economic vulnerability to drought was twice as high in lower-income countries compared to higher-income countries (Formetta and Feyen, 2019).Figure 4.9 | Current global drought risk and its components.  (a)  Drought hazard computed for the events between 1901 and 2010 by the probability of exceedance the median of global severe precipitation deficits, using precipitation data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) for 1901–2010. (b)  Drought vulnerability is derived from an arithmetic composite model combining social, economic and infrastructural factors proposed by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR, 2004). (c)  Drought exposure computed at the sub-national level with the non-compensatory Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model (Cook et al., 2014). (d)  Drought risk based on the above components of hazard, vulnerability and exposure, scored on a scale of 0 (lowest risk) to 1 (highest risk) with the lowest and highest hazard, exposure and vulnerability (Carrão et al., 2016).Open figure AR6 WGI (Douville et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021) found that increasing agricultural and ecological droughts trends are more evident than increasing trends in meteorological drought in several regions due to increased evaporative demand. Therefore, WGI concluded with high confidence that the increased frequency and the severity of agricultural/ecological droughts over the last decades in the Mediterranean and western North America can be attributed to anthropogenic warming.In addition, there is high confidence in anthropogenic influence on increased meteorological drought in southwestern Australia and medium confidence that recent drying and severe droughts in southern Africa and southwestern South America can be attributed to human influence. Increased agricultural/ecological and (or) meteorological and (or) hydrological drought is also seen with either medium confidence or high confidence in the trend but with low confidence on attribution to anthropogenic climate change in western, northeastern and central Africa; central, eastern and southern Asia; eastern Australia; southern and northeastern South America and the South American monsoon region; and western and central Europe. Finally, decreased drought in one or more categories is seen with medium confidence in western and eastern Siberia; northern and central Australia; southeastern South America; central North America and northern Europe, but with low confidence in attribution to anthropogenic influence, except in northern Europe, where anthropogenic influence on decreased meteorological drought is assessed with medium confidence.Major drought events worldwide have had substantial societal and ecological impacts, including reduced crop yields, shortages of drinking water, wildfires causing deaths of people and very large numbers of animals, impacting the habitats of threatened species, and widespread economic losses (Table 4.4, Cross-Chapter Box DISASTER in Chapter 4). In addition, anthropogenic climate change was found to have increased the likelihood or severity of most such events examined in event attribution studies.Although long-term drought trends are clearer for agricultural or ecological drought compared to meteorological droughts (Douville et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021), most attribution studies for individual extreme events focus on meteorological (precipitation) drought and sometimes also consider temperature anomalies. A complete examination of drought relevant to societal impacts often requires consideration of hydrological and agricultural drought, so extreme event attribution conclusions relating to precipitation alone may not fully capture the processes leading to societal effects. There is, therefore, a critical knowledge gap in the attribution of changes in drought indicators more closely related to societal impacts such as soil moisture and the availability of fresh water supplies.In summary, droughts can have substantial societal impacts (virtually certain), and agricultural and ecological drought conditions in particular have become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world but less frequent and severe in some others (high confidence). Drought-induced economic losses relative to GDP are approximately twice as high in lower-income countries compared to higher-income countries, although the gap has narrowed since the 1980s, and at the global scale there is a decreasing trend of economic vulnerability to drought (medium confidence). Nevertheless, anthropogenic climate change has contributed to the increased likelihood or severity of drought events in many parts of the world, causing reduced agricultural yields, drinking water shortages for millions of people, increased wildfire risk, loss of lives of humans and other species and loss of billions of dollars of economic damages (medium confidence).
