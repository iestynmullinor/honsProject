Although AR5 did not explicitly mention finance for water-related adaptation actions, it considered urban adaptation (Revi et al., 2014) and risk financing (Arent et al., 2014). SR1.5 (de Coninck et al., 2018) discussed governance and finance limitations, while SRCCL discussed finance in adapting to floods and droughts (Hurlbert et al., 2019).Mitigation garners the significant share of committed climate finance. For example, of the total USD 15.4 billion climate finance commitments through ‘green bonds’, 79% accrued to mitigation and the rest to adaptation (World Bank, 2017). However, within adaptation finance, water garners a significant share of adaptation funds, with 13% of the Adaptation Fund’s investments were for water management, 12% for coastal management and 10% for disaster risk reduction (Adaptation Fund, 2018). Similarly, within the urban adaptation landscape, which got ~3–5% of total adaptation finance flows of USD 30.8 billion tracked in 2017–2018 (Richmond et al., 2021), water and wastewater management projects received the largest share of urban adaptation finance (USD 761 million annually) followed by disaster risk management (USD 323 million) (Richmond et al., 2021). However, more frequent tracking of public financing is required, with a greater focus on transparency and accountability (Ciplet et al., 2018; Khan et al., 2020) and justice and social equity (Emrich et al., 2020) (also see Cross-Chapter Box FINANCE in Chapter 17).Private financing remains a minor source of adaptation financing (World Bank, 2019). Around 39% of green bonds issued in 2017 were for water, wastewater and solid waste management (World Bank, 2017). In 2018, USD 100.5 billion of water-themed bonds were issued, mainly in Europe (63%), the Asia Pacific (19.6%) and North America (14.9%) (Filkova et al., 2018; World Bank, 2019). Such financing focuses on returns and scale (Cholibois, 2020), and as such, local needs, especially those of the poor, may not be adequately represented (Manuamorn et al., 2020; Williams, 2020) (medium confidence). COVID-19 will probably affect adaptation financing in water. Countries will be fiscally stretched to finance public investments domestically and through international development aid (Barbier and Burgess, 2020). However, investments in flood and drought management (Phillips et al., 2020) and water and sanitation (Armitage and Nellums, 2020b; Bhowmick et al., 2020) are critical for building resilience against pandemics, and are also crucial elements of adaptation in water. Therefore, integrated approaches that achieve both goals need to be deployed (Barbier and Burgess, 2020; Newell and Dale, 2020) (Box 4.4., Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7).In summary, water garners a significant share of public and private adaptation funds (high confidence). However, current COVID-19-related cuts in adaptation financing may further impede developing countries’ ability to invest in adequate water adaptation.
