AR5 concluded that successful adaptation across all sectors depends on access to technology, and technology transfer can play an essential role in building up adaptive capacity (Noble et al., 2014). SR1.5 discussed the role of efficient irrigation technologies in adaptation (de Coninck et al., 2018).Technologies that reduce carbon emissions by promoting the efficient use of water can support successful adaptation (Biagini et al., 2014), provided they do not have adverse distributional outcomes (medium evidence, high agreement ). Water management in agriculture has long seen the use of technology. For example, the use of technology to improve access to water, for example, through the diffusion of groundwater pumps in the 1970s in South Asia, had several livelihood benefits, but made agriculture more carbon-intensive (Zaveri et al., 2016). More recently, technology has been used to improve water use efficiency in agriculture through the adoption of drip and sprinkler irrigation (Zhuo and Hoekstra, 2017; Grafton et al., 2018), and the use of the Internet of Things (IoT) (Keswani et al., 2019). In addition, innovations to reuse water through various wastewater recovery technologies (Diaz-Elsayed et al., 2019; Capodaglio, 2020), create potable water through desalinisation (Caldera et al., 2018) and reuse of wastewater in agriculture (Salgot and Folch, 2018) are also on the rise (Box 4.5). Solar technologies are increasingly used for irrigation, wastewater recovery, desalinisation and water harvesting (Algarni et al., 2018; Pouyfaucon and García-Rodríguez, 2018; Tu et al., 2018; Zhao F. et al., 2020). Machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies (Doorn, 2021) have started being used in many water-use sectors, such as urban settings (Nie et al., 2020), wastewater management (Abdallah et al., 2020; Ben Ammar et al., 2020) and agricultural water management, but mostly in high-income countries mostly on an experimental basis (Tsang and Jim, 2016; González Perea et al., 2018). Technology is being increasingly used in hydrological sciences for measurements and monitoring (SM4.1), as well as for creating comprehensive hydrometeorological warning systems (Funk et al., 2015). Lack of technology and knowledge transfer, especially related to remote sensing, is an adaptation barrier in states with less resources (Funk et al., 2015).Adoption of technologies depends on the availability of finance (Section 4.8.2). The effectiveness of technology in reducing climate-related risks depends on its appropriateness to the local context (Biagini et al., 2014; Mfitumukiza et al., 2020) and other factors, including institutional and governance frameworks (high confidence). Water technologies can also have unintended outcomes, leading to maladaptation in some cases. For example, efficient irrigation technologies like drip and sprinkler irrigation, while reducing water application rates per unit of land, can increase overall water extraction by increasing total land under irrigation (van der Kooij et al., 2013; Grafton et al., 2018; Mpanga and Idowu, 2021). Water-related technologies can also have adverse distributional outcomes when gains from technology adoption accrue disproportionately to a small section of the population; for example, only rich and male farmers can adopt high-cost technologies like solar irrigation pumps (Gupta, 2019) (medium confidence).In summary, technology is an important part of water adaptation response, and outcomes of technology adoption are mediated through other societal factors, including institutions, governance frameworks and equity and justice issues (medium evidence, high agreement ).
