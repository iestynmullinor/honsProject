All previous IPCC reports have focused on future water-related risks to urban areas due to climate change rather than documented observed impacts.Climate extremes have profound implications for urban and peri-urban water management, particularly in an increasingly urbanised world (high confidence). Over half (54%) of the global population currently lives in cities (WWAP, 2019), and global urbanisation rates continue to increase across all SSPs (Jiang and O’Neill, 2017). Using observed station data for 217 urban areas worldwide, Mishra et al. (2015) noted that 17% of cities experienced statistically significant increases (p value < 0.05) in the frequency of daily precipitation extremes from 1973 to 2012 and hypothesised that such observed climate changes in urban areas were largely due to large-scale changes rather than local land cover changes.Since AR5, factors such as rapid population growth, urbanisation, ageing infrastructure and changes in water use have also magnified climate risks, such as drought and flooding, and contributed to urban and peri-urban water insecurity (medium agreement, medium evidence) (Section 4.1.2). For example, despite an increase in flooding events from 1.1 flood events yr –1 (1986–2005) to five flood events yr –1 (2006–2016) in Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), analyses of rainfall indices showed few have significant trends at a 5% level over the period 1961–2015 and that the generalised extreme value distribution fit the time series of annual maximum daily rainfall (Tazen et al., 2019). On the other hand, long-term annual variations of maximum hourly precipitation in Shanghai (China) increased significantly during 1916–2014, especially from 1981.Advances in the attribution of extreme weather events have made it possible to determine the causal relationship between droughts, floods and climate change for some cities, particularly those with long hydro-meteorological records (Bader et al., 2018; Otto et al., 2020). Attribution analysis shows that urbanisation contributed to the increase in both frequencies of local and abrupt heavy rainfall events in the city, at a rate of 1.5 and 1.8 10 yr –1, respectively (Liang and Ding, 2017). A multi-method attribution showed that the likelihood of prolonged rainfall deficit in Cape Town (South Africa) during 2015–2017 was made more likely by a factor of 3.3 (1.4–6.4) due to anthropogenic climate change (Otto et al., 2018). These results show that climate change has impacted the return time of extreme droughts in the Western Cape, exceeding the capacity of the existing water supply system to cope (Otto et al., 2018) (Box 9.4; 9.8.2). In Baton Rouge (USA), a rapid attribution study showed that the probability of an event such as the intense precipitation and flash flooding of August 2016 has increased by at least a factor of 1.4 due to radiative forcing (USA) (van der Wiel et al., 2017). In Houston (USA), a study found that the combination of urbanisation and climate change nearly doubled peak discharge (84%) during Hurricane Harvey (August 2017), suggesting that land use change magnified the effects of climate change on catchment response to extreme precipitation events (Sebastian et al., 2019) (14.4.3.1; Box 14.5 The Economic Consequences of Climate Change in North America, Cross-Chapter Box DISASTER in Chapter 4). According to a multi-method approach, the 2014/2015 drought event in Sao Paulo (Brazil) was more likely to have been driven by water use changes and population growth than climate change (Otto et al., 2015) (Cross-Chapter Box DISASTER in Chapter 4).The science of weather event attribution requires high-quality observational data and climate models that are currently available only in highly developed countries (Otto et al., 2020). In addition, further research is necessary to determine the impacts of climate change on water-related extremes in the urban areas of developing countries (Bai et al., 2018). For example, a combination of observational analysis and global coupled climate models showed that the 2015 flooding event in Chennai (India) could not be attributed to anthropogenic climate change, with the effects of that being relatively small in the region due to the impact of GHG increases being largely counteracted by those of aerosols (van Oldenborgh et al., 2017a) (Section 4.2.5). Further research is also required to determine the impacts of climate change on water-related extremes in informal settlements where vulnerability to water insecurity is high due to poverty, overcrowding, poor-quality housing and lack of basic infrastructure (Scovronick et al., 2015; Grasham et al., 2019; Williams et al., 2019; Satterthwaite et al., 2020).In summary, water-related hazards such as drought and flooding have been exacerbated by climate change in some cities (high confidence). Further research is necessary to determine the extent and nature of water-related climate change impacts in the urban areas of developing countries (high confidence).
