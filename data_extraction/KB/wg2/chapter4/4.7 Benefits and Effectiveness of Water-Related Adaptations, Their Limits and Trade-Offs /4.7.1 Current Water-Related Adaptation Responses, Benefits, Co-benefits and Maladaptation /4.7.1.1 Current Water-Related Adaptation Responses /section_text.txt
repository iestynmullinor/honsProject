We define an adaptation response as a water-related adaptation if the hazard is water-related (e.g., floods, droughts, extreme rainfall events, groundwater depletion, melting and thawing of cryosphere, Figure 4.25) or the adaptation intervention is water-related (e.g., irrigation, rainwater harvesting, soil moisture conservation, etc.). Adaptation responses were implemented across all water use sub-sectors assessed in this chapter (Section 4.6, Figure 4.23). Given the overall interest in assessing adaptations that documents outcomes, we limited our analysis to a set of 359 unique articles that measure outcomes of adaptation across pre-defined outcome categories (SM4.2, Table SM4.5; Berrang-Ford et al., 2021a; Mukherji et al., 2021). A total of 1054 adaptation responses were documented in the 359 case studies; these were categorised into 16 categories (Figure 4.22). These adaptation responses are not always specific to long-term climate change impacts (that is, changes in annual mean fluxes), but rather respond to changes in variability in the water cycle and specific water hazards. Adaptation to internal variability is needed to increase the resilience to projected water cycle changes because water cycle changes primarily manifest as changes in variability (Douville et al., 2021).Figure 4.23 | Sectoral distribution of documented water-related adaptation responses (observed adaptation) across the 16 categories derived from Figure4. 22. The quantity of evidence is derived from the number of papers in a particular adaptation response category where high is > 40 papers, medium is 10–40 papers and low is < 10 papers. Confidence in evidence relates to the way the article links outcomes of adaptation with the adaptation response. Category 1: studies causally link adaptation outcomes to the adaptation response by constructing credible counterfactuals; category 2: studies correlate responses and outcomes without causal attribution; category 3: studies describe adaptation outcomes without making any causal or correlation claims between adaptation outcomes and adaptation responses. High confidence: more than 67% of the studies fall in categories 1 and 2; medium confidence: 50–67% of the studies are in categories 1 and 2, and low confidence is less than 50% of studies are in categories 1 and 2.Open figure There is high confidence that a significant share of water-related adaptations is occurring in the agriculture sector. Agriculture accounts for 60–70% of total water withdrawals (Hanasaki et al., 2018; Burek et al., 2020; Müller Schmied et al., 2021) and supports the livelihoods of a large majority of people in the developing countries. Within the agriculture sector, there is high confidence in the quality and quantity of evidence of adaptation responses such as improved cultivars and agronomic practices, on-farm irrigation and water management and water and soil moisture conservation, and medium confidence, derived from robust evidence, and medium agreement  for other most other adaptation responses (Figure 4.23 and Figure 4.24). Most of these adaptation case studies are from Asia and Africa, and agriculture is the predominant sector where most of these adaptation responses are being implemented (high confidence) (Section 4.6.2). However, the sectoral nature of adaptation responses varies across continents. Agriculture is the most important sector in all continents, except Europe and Australasia, where most adaptation occurs in the urban sector (high confidence) (Figure 4.24).Figure 4.24 | Location of case studies on water-related adaptation which measure adaptation outcomes (n= 359) and their sectoral distribution across all regions. Circles denote the number of case studies in a particular location in the continent. The pie chart shows the sectors in which adaptation is taking place. The sectors correspond to water use sectors described in Sections 4.3, 4.5 and 4.6 of this chapter.Open figure The top four adaptation responses in terms of frequency of documentation are changes in the cropping pattern and crop systems (145 responses), improved crop cultivars and agronomic practices (139 responses), irrigation and water management practices (115 responses) and water and soil conservation measures (102 responses). These top four responses provide several benefits such as higher incomes and yields, better water use efficiencies and related outcomes (high confidence) (Table 4.9 and Figure 4.27). However, those benefits are incremental, that is, they help improve crop production and incomes, at least in the short run, but may not automatically lead to transformative outcomes and climate risk reductions (Pelling et al., 2015; Fedele et al., 2019). One way to move from incremental to transformative adaptation could be to invest gains from incremental adaptation in education and capacity building to improve overall adaptive capacity (Vermeulen et al., 2018). Responses such as migration, including spontaneous and planned relocation, are also relatively well documented (medium confidence), as are responses such as collective action, training and capacity building and economic and financial measures for increasing adaptive capacities (medium confidence). These categories of adaptation can potentially lead to transformative outcomes, such as a shift to livelihoods that are less exposed to climate hazards. However, transformative pathways are not always straightforward (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2020) (Table 4.8).Table 4.8 | Illustrative examples of case studies of water-related adaptation responses where outcomes were measured (n= 359). These cases include instances where adaptation benefits were positive, negative or neutral. Examples also include studies with or without causal and correlation links between adaptation response and outcomes (categories 1, 2 and 3 studies as described in the caption of Figure 4.23). The purpose of the table is to provide a list of illustrative examples to showcase the wide range of adaptation responses that are being implemented. Table 4.9 zooms into examples where adaptation had positive benefits on any of the selected parameters described in Section 4.7.1.2.Name of the adaptation response (number of documented responses in that category)Description of adaptation responseSourcesChanges in the cropping pattern and crop systems(145 responses)Changes in cropping pattern; e.g., the introduction of sugarcane and rice in Costa Rica; crop diversification in Ethiopia and Zimbabwe; crop diversification in TanzaniaSingh et al.

All these studies are either category 1 or category 2 studies in that the link between adaptation response and the outcome is either causal or correlated with one another. These benefits notwithstanding, links of adaptation benefits to climate and associated risk reduction are not always clear. Some of these adaptation responses can have beneficial outcomes in one of the five parameters, but can have maladaptive outcomes in others.HazardAdaptation responsesOutcome categoryAdaptation outcomeReferenceDroughts, floods, and general climate impacts in NepalImproved crop cultivars, agronomic practices, irrigation, soil water conservation measuresEconomic and financial outcomesFarming households that adapted produced about 33% more rice than households that did not adapt after controlling for all heterogeneity.Khanal et al.

Birr is the Ethiopian currency.Teklewold et al. (2017)Droughts and general climate impacts, South AfricaCrop insurance and irrigationFarmers who insured their farm business and had access to irrigation had relatively higher net revenue than those who did not, but this link is not causal. Instead, it shows causality could go either way, including those farmers who were better off getting their business insured.Elum et al. (2018)Droughts and floods in KenyaMigrationRemittance income enables uptake of costlier adaptation measures such as a change in livestock species, which also have higher returns for households. Therefore, the study was not causal in its inference.Ng’ang’a et al.

The other three top hazards are general climate impacts, heat-related hazards and inland and riverine flooding (Figure 4.25). The majority of the adaptation responses across all categories were introduced by individuals and households, followed by the civil society, and hence autonomous (Figure 4.26). The private sector (defined as profit-making companies and distinct from individual farmers and households) has played a relatively minor role in initiating adaptation responses. However, the low participation of the private sector in initiating adaptation responses could be partly an artefact of the nature of documentation.Figure 4.25 | Water-related adaptations and climate hazards against which adaptation responses are forged.
