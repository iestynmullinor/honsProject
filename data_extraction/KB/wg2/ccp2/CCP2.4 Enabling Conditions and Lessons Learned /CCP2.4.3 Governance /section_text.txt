An array of climatic and non-climatic perils (Le Cozannet et al., 2017) present coastal communities and their governing authorities with immense governance and institutional challenges that will become progressively more difficult as sea level rises (high confidence; Wallace, 2017; Leal Filho et al., 2018; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). Yet a study of public provisions for coastal adaptation in 136 of the largest coastal port–urban agglomerations across 68 countries found no policy implementation in 50% of the cases; in 85% of cases, adaptation actions are not framed by current impacts or future risks, and formal efforts are recent and concentrated in more developed settings (Olazabal et al., 2019; Olazabal and Ruiz De Gopegui, 2021), thus underscoring a persistent coastal adaptation gap. Translating these challenges into enabling governance conditions is difficult, but instructive lessons are being learned and are summarised (from Table SMCCP2.4) for archetypal C&S in Tables CCP2.1 and 2.2.We start with a synopsis of governance settings within which coastal adaptation and CRD choices are made, and spotlight factors hindering and enabling translation of adaptation into practice. Then, building upon and extending the SROCC analysis of enablers and lessons learned in responding to SLR (Oppenheimer et al., 2019), we assess key governance challenges, related enablers and lessons learned (Tables CCP2.1, Section CCP2.2).Governance arrangements and practices are embedded in the sociopolitical and institutional fabric of coastal C&S. Consequently, barriers and enablers for adapting to climate change at the coast and charting pathways for CRD reflect more general constraints and opportunities (high confidence; Meerow, 2017; Rocle and Salles, 2018; Rosendo et al., 2018; Di Giulio et al., 2019; Hölscher et al., 2019; Van Assche et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2020). Local-level action is often constrained: 231 cities in the USA report weak leadership, lack of funding and staffing, and low political will (Fu, 2020). A meta-analysis of coastal municipal planning documents in Australia shows that few localities have moved beyond risk assessment (Bradley et al., 2015). Coastal C&S tend to prefer strategies that protect and accommodate existing coastline assets in the sense of a ‘fix and forget’ approach (Gibbs, 2015), rather than enduring proactive adaptation (Cooper and Pile, 2014).Many C&S, especially in the Global South, already face high exposure to coastal risks and development constraints associated with poverty and socioeconomic inequality, lack of transparent resource allocation mechanisms and low political will (high confidence; Di Giulio et al., 2019; Nagy et al., 2019; Pasquini, 2020; Lehmann et al., 2021). Research from across South America notes inadequate regulatory frameworks, missing data and information, widespread coastal ecosystem degradation and complex interactions between natural disasters and civil conflict (Villamizar et al., 2017; Nagy et al., 2019). Coastal climate risks in the Global South are often compounded by ongoing land-use management conflicts and other pressures including informal land uses, unregulated and/or inadequate infrastructure/building development, public health priorities such as combating Dengue fever, inadequate income diversification, low education levels and political marginalization of communities historically not represented in the urban development process (Barbi and Ferreira, 2014; Salik et al., 2015; Cabral et al., 2017; Goh, 2019). There are also entrenched socioeconomic inequalities leading to the maldistribution of adaptation actions and benefits in the Global North (Gould and Lewis, 2018; Keenan et al., 2018; Ranganathan and Bratman, 2019; Yumagulova, 2020; Long et al., 2021).To address the myriad governance challenges attributed to low awareness, low skills, scalar mismatches, and high socioeconomic inequality and coastal vulnerability, post-AR5 research highlights enablers of more innovative approaches to bridge capacity, policy and financial deficits (Reiblich et al., 2019), and facilitate more proactive implementation of coastal adaptation actions (Table SMCCP2.2; Fu, 2020). A survey of NGOs, state and local government across Alaska, Florida and Maryland in the USA found that perceived risk, uncertainty and trust in support for climate adaptation varied across two stages of adaptation, that is between support for the development of plans and willingness to allocate human and financial resources to implement plans (Kettle and Dow, 2016). To bridge this gap, Cinner et al. (2018) suggest the need to build capacity across five domains: the assets that people can draw upon in times of need; the flexibility to change strategies and interventions; the ability to organise and act collectively; learning to recognise and respond to change (especially as important thresholds are approached); and the agency to determine whether to change or not, and to then take prudent action.Effective and accountable local leadership can help to mobilise capacities, resources and climate awareness within coastal C&S. Strong leadership is associated with agenda-setting authorities and the ability to navigate complex institutional interests towards more strategic planning efforts (high confidence; Ferguson et al., 2013; Anguelovski et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2017; Valdivieso and Andersson, 2018; Fink, 2019; Ndebele-Murisa et al., 2020). Policy leadership can positively influence the motivation and initiative of municipal officers (Lassa and Nugraha, 2014; Wijaya et al., 2020), whilst local leadership is needed integrate coastal management, disaster management and climate adaptation mandates (Rosendo et al., 2018).Inclusive decision-making arrangements can enable participation, local ownership, and further equity in crafting coastal adaptation plans and policies (Chu et al., 2016). Inclusion of diverse stakeholders can help improve awareness of adaptation needs; help to bridge existing social inequalities in decision-making about adaption needs, options and outcomes; close the gap between formal and informal institutions and engage indigenous forms of decision-making, which often associate climate risks with livelihood, housing and employment stressors (Ziervogel et al., 2016; Fayombo, 2020). For example, research from Pacific island states (Nunn et al., 2017) and coastal Arctic zones (Romero Manrique et al., 2018) highlights the need to engage with indigenous environmental knowledge. Case studies from Indonesia, the Philippines and Timor-Leste show that Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge and customary laws can support environmental awareness, strengthen social cohesion and help communities to better respond to climate impacts (Hiwasaki et al., 2015). Research from coastal Cambodia shows that inclusive governance arrangements can target empowerment of the most vulnerable groups to facilitate better adaptation behaviour and mainstream adaption knowledge through both formal and informal education at the community level (Ung et al., 2016).The law is key to governing climate risks in C&S, including regulating exposure to coastal hazards; facilitating accountable decision-making; funding arrangements, liabilities and resolving disputes; and also for securing human rights (high confidence; Setzer and Vanhala, 2019; Averill, 2020). However, it has limits and can be both an adaptation enabler and barrier (Green et al., 2015; Cosens et al., 2017; Craig et al., 2017; DeCaro et al., 2017). Contemporary legal practice has not enabled effective adaptation in part because SLR affects compensable property rights that are secured by the law, and which generally trump concerns about public safety, resilience and sustainability (Reiblich et al., 2019). Private property rights can be used as both a sword and a shield to privilege dominant interests by undermining land use policies, plans and implementation efforts intended to promote integrated coastal management and risk reduction (O’Donnell et al., 2019; Reiblich et al., 2019). Climate change litigation has proliferated over the past decade (Setzer and Vanhala, 2019), addressing, among other things, failures to prepare for or adapt to climate change, and to secure human rights (Peel and Osofsky, 2018). Reflexive and adaptive law that accounts for the distinctive features of coastal hazard risk and associated governance imperatives builds coastal C&S adaptive capacity and resilience (high confidence; Garmestani and Benson, 2013; Cosens et al., 2017; DeCaro et al., 2017). Procedural justice, due process and use of substantive standards instead of rules provide legal stability and enable adaptation (Craig et al., 2017). Coastal adaptation efforts are ultimately implemented through C&S actions that are enabled or constrained by prevailing legislative, executive and judicial provisions and practices, which differ significantly across jurisdictions (He, 2018). In practice, the ‘coastal lawscape’ is made up of interconnected cultural normative, political and legal systems that need to be understood holistically to enable coastal adaptation in C&S (O’Donnell, 2021).Tables CCP2.1 and CCP2.2 summarise key insights about key governance challenges facing archetypal coastal C&S around the world as well as associated critical enablers and lessons learned to address climate change-compounded coastal hazard risk (based on synthesis of Table SMCCP2.3).In sum, prospects for addressing climate risk in archetypal coastal C&S around the world depend on the extent to which societal choices—and associated governance processes and practices—address the drivers and root causes of exposure and social vulnerability (very high confidence). Coastal C&S are more able to address these challenges when authorities work with local communities and vulnerable groups in particular, and with stakeholders from the local to national levels and beyond, to chart adaptation pathways that enable sustained reduction in the exposure and vulnerability of those most at risk  (very high confidence; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Magnan et al., 2019; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). Unlocking potential enablers for locally appropriate and effective adaptation is difficult because many drivers and root causes of coastal risk are historically and institutionally embedded  (high confidence; Thomas et al., 2019). Charting credible, salient and legitimate adaptation pathways is consequently a struggle in reconciling divergent worldviews, values and interests (Sovacool, 2018; Mendenhall et al., 2020; Bowden et al., 2021a; Bowden et al., 2021b). Unlocking the productive potential of conflict is foundational for transitioning towards pathways that foster CRD (high confidence; Abrahams and Carr, 2017; Harris et al., 2018; Sharifi, 2020). But this can be especially challenging for low-lying coastal C&S characterised by degraded coastal ecosystems susceptible to climate change impacts as well as pronounced inequity and governance constraints  (high confidence; Esteban et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2020).Table CCP2.1 | Governance challenges and critical enablers for addressing coastal hazard risk in C&SKey governance challengesCritical enablers for C&S to address coastal hazard riskComplexity:  climate change compounds non-climatic hazard risks facing coastal C&S in interconnected, dynamic and emergent ways for which there are no simple solutions.Draw on multiple knowledge systems to co-design and co-produce more acceptable, effective and enduring responses.Build governance capacity to tackle complex problems.Time horizon and uncertainty: The future is uncertain, but climate change will continue for generations and cannot be addressed by short-term (e.g., 1–10 years) responses alone.Adopt a long-term view but take action now. Keep options open to adjust responses as climate risk escalates and circumstances change.Avoid new development commitments in exposed locations. Enable managed retreat in most at-risk locations by anticipatory actions, e.g., secure funds, legal provisions for buy-outs, resettlement, etc. Cross-scale and cross-domain coordination: Decisions bound by jurisdictional and sectoral boundaries fail to address linkages within and between coastal ecosystems and C&S facing interconnected climate change-compounded impacts and risk.Develop networks and linkages within and between different governance scales and levels and across policy domains and sectors, to improve coordination, build trust and legitimise decisions.Build shared understanding and enable locally appropriate responses through experimentation, innovation and social learning.Equity and social vulnerability: Climate change compounds everyday inequity and vulnerability in coastal C&S, making it difficult to disentangle and address social drivers and root causes of risk.Recognise political realities and prioritise vulnerability, justice and equity concerns to enable just, impactful and enduring outcomes.Strengthen community capabilities to respond to coastal hazard risk, using external assistance and government support if necessary.Social conflict: Coastal C&S will be the focal point of contending views about appropriate climate responses, and face the challenge of avoiding destructive conflict and realising its productive potential.Design and facilitate tailor-made participation processes, involving stakeholders early and consistently from negotiating responses to implementation.Create safe arenas of engagement  for inclusive, informed and meaningful deliberation and collaborative problem-solving.Table CCP2.2 | Lessons learned from efforts to address coastal hazard riskLessons to address governance challenges and unlock enablersArchetypal C&S initiatives, constraints asideComplexity: multiple knowledge systemsReveal dynamic complexity drawing on multiple sources of locally relevant evidence.Use and integrate local, Indigenous and scientific knowledge.Include marginalised voices and knowledge of vulnerable groups, women, young people, etc.Build shared understanding through storytelling.Bridge gaps between science, policy and practice by experimenting with novel approaches and working across organisational, sectoral and institutional boundaries.Seychelles (0.1 million; open coast):  Science–policy–local knowledge partnerships to co-produce usable information for decision-making.Dhaka, Bangladesh (21 million; delta): Climate change is national priority.
