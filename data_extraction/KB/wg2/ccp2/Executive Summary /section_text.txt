Extensive adaptation planning has been undertaken since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), but there has not been widespread effective implementation, thus giving rise to a ‘coastal adaptation gap’ (high confidence). To date, most interventions have been reactive and often rely on protective works alone (high confidence). The effectiveness of alternative interventions differs among C&S archetypes, while their feasibility is influenced by geomorphology and socioeconomic conditions as well as cultural, political and institutional considerations (very high confidence). Mismatches between adaptation needs and patterns of physical development are commonplace in many coastal C&S, with particularly adverse impacts on poor and marginalised communities in the Global North and Global South (high confidence). Overcoming this gap is key to transitioning towards CRD (medium confidence). Under higher warming levels and higher SLR, increasingly dichotomous coastal futures will become more entrenched (medium confidence), with stark differences between more urbanised, resource-rich coastal C&S dependent on hard protection, and more rural, resource-poor C&S facing displacement and migration {CCP2.3; CCP2.4, Chapter 18}.Coastal adaptation innovators adopt more flexible, anticipatory and integrative strategies, combining technical and non-technical interventions that account for uncertainties and facilitate effective resolution of conflicting interests and worldviews (limited evidence, high agreement ). Moreover, a core set of critical enablers is foundational for C&S to chart CRD pathways. These include building and strengthening governance capabilities to tackle complex problems; taking a long-term perspective in making short-term decisions; enabling more effective coordination across scales, sectors and policy domains; reducing injustice, inequity, and social vulnerability; and unlocking the productive potential of coastal conflict while strengthening local democracy  (medium evidence, high agreement ) {Table CCP2.1, Table CCP2.2; CCP2.3; CCP2.4; Chapters 17, 18; Cross-Chapter Box DEEP in Chapter 17}.C&S play a pivotal role in global aspirations to implement the Paris Agreement, advance the SDGs and foster CRD. Progress towards these ends depends on the extent to which C&S mobilise urgent and transformational changes to institutionalise enabling conditions, close the coastal adaptation gap by addressing the drivers and root causes of exposure and vulnerability to climate-compounded coastal hazard risks, and drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions (medium confidence) {CCP2.4; Chapter 18}
