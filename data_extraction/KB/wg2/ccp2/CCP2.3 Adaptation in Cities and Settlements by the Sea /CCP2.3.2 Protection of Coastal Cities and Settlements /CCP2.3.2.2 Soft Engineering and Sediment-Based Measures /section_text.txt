Sediment-based interventions, for example beach nourishment, aim to limit coastal erosion and flood risk and have become a widely applied strategy, especially in open-coast archetypal C&S. This is in part because there is less impact on adjacent beaches and coastal ecology and also lower construction and maintenance costs compared to hard protection (high confidence; Parkinson and Ogurcak, 2018). In addition, it is considered a flexible strategy under more rapid SLR conditions (Kabat et al., 2009; Stive et al., 2013) and can be applied in the form of a mega-nourishment strategy, wherein natural currents distribute sand along the coast (Stive et al., 2013; de Schipper et al., 2021). However, there are limits to this strategy due to environmental impacts, costs and the availability of potential and permitted sand reserves, which may be unable to keep up with higher rates of SLR (Parkinson and Ogurcak, 2018; Haasnoot et al., 2019; Harris et al., 2021; Staudt et al., 2021). Simultaneously, other socioeconomic needs (e.g., damming rivers or for building and transport infrastructure) may compete for sand as a limited resource (Torres et al., 2017; Bendixen et al., 2019). Regional and global governance provisions (e.g., spatial reservations for sand mining, international frameworks for distribution) could improve long-term feasibility (Torres et al., 2017; Parkinson and Ogurcak, 2018; Bendixen et al., 2019; Haasnoot et al., 2019).
