Nature-based measures, such as retaining mangroves and marshes, have been successful in reducing deaths and damage due to storm surges (medium evidence, high agreement ; Das and Vincent, 2009; Saleh and Weinstein, 2016; Narayan et al., 2017; Triyanti et al., 2017; Hochard et al., 2019; del Valle et al., 2020), and reportedly provide USD 23.2 billion yr–1 in storm protection services across the USA (Saleh and Weinstein, 2016). They are also a cost-effective strategy (medium confidence) that provides C&S with additional co-benefits through ecosystem services (high confidence; Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2; Section 2.2.4; Narayan et al., 2016; Depietri and McPhearson, 2017; Morris et al., 2018; Reguero et al., 2018; Chausson et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020; NIES and ISME, 2020; Reguero et al., 2020; Sudmeier-Rieux et al., 2021).Nature-based measures can reduce inland propagation of extreme sea levels (high tides, storm surges; high agreement ; Godfroy et al., 2019; James et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020b), with vertical reduction in water levels ranging from 5 to 50 cm/km behind large mangroves and marshes (Stark et al., 2015; Van Coppenolle and Temmerman, 2020). They also attenuate wind-driven waves and reduce shoreline erosion (high agreement ), and this can be by as much as 90% over stretches of 10–100 m for dense mangrove and marsh vegetation (medium evidence; Li et al., 2014; Möller et al., 2014; Vuik et al., 2016; Vuik et al., 2018; Godfroy et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020a) and up to 40% for dunes (Feagin et al., 2019). Coral reefs on average reduce wave energy by 97% (Ferrario et al., 2014). Seagrass meadows attenuate wind waves to a lesser extent, and are only effective in water <0.2 m deep (Ondiviela et al., 2014; Narayan et al., 2016; Morris et al., 2019).Within limits, coastal ecosystems can respond to RSL through sediment accretion and lateral inland movement (Kirwan et al., 2016; Schuerch et al., 2018). Nature-based measures have the greatest potential in coastal deltas and estuaries, where human populations are exposed, but large ecosystems, like mangroves and marshes, can be conserved and restored (Menéndez et al., 2020; Van Coppenolle and Temmerman, 2020). Their feasibility depends on physical, ecological, institutional and socioeconomic conditions that are typically locality dependent (Temmerman and Kirwan, 2015; Arkema et al., 2017); space may not be available in certain places (e.g., intensive urbanization on the shoreline), or these measures may conflict with other human demands for scarce land (Tian et al., 2016). Successful nature-based measures require site-specific knowledge and science-based design, pilot monitoring and adaptive upscaling (Evans et al., 2017; Nesshöver et al., 2017), as well as a more rigorous understanding of long-term performance, maintenance and costs (Kumar et al., 2021).Nature-based measures are increasingly implemented in combination with hard protection measures (Hu et al., 2019; Schoonees et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2020; Oanh et al., 2020). They can reduce dike failure and increase design life where sediment accretion allows wetlands to respond to SLR (Jongman, 2018; Vuik et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2020a). There is high agreement  that a hybrid strategy combining hard and soft protection strategies is more effective and less costly under many circumstances, and there is limited evidence that technical limits will be encountered with such a strategy for low-lying C&S built on soft or permeable soil or with high exposure to monsoons and river discharges (Spalding et al., 2014; Sutton-Grier et al., 2015; Pontee et al., 2016; Morris et al., 2018; Reguero et al., 2018; Du et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020; Seddon et al., 2020; Waryszak et al., 2021).
