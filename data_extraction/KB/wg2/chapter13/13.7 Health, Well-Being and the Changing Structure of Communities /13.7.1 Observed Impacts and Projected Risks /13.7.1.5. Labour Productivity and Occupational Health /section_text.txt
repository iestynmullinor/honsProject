Extreme heat and cold waves have been linked to an increased risk of occupational injuries (Martinez-Solanas et al., 2018) and changes in labour productivity (Orlov et al., 2019; García-León et al., 2021), while evidence on the consequences of other extreme events is lacking. The sectors with a high percentage of high-intensity outdoor work in Europe, mainly agriculture and construction, have the highest risk of increased injury and labour productivity losses, but also manufacturing and service sectors can be affected when air conditioning is not available (Section 13.6.1.3; Gosling et al., 2018; Szewczyk et al., 2018; Dellink et al., 2019; Orlov et al., 2019). The heatwaves of August 2003, July 2010 and July 2015 were concentrated in SEU and led to reductions in monthly worker productivity of on average 3–3.5% in SEU, ranging up to 8–9% in Cyprus (2003, 2010) and Italy (2015) (Orlov et al., 2019); in contrast, the heatwave of 2018 centred on NEU but also led to pronounced productivity reductions in WCE and SEU (García-León et al., 2021). Each of these major European heatwaves led to considerable economic losses in agriculture and construction (high confidence) and reduced GDP in Europe (except EEU) by 0.3–0.5% (García-León et al., 2021). At 2.5°C GWL and beyond, GDP losses are projected to increase fivefold compared with 1981–2010, ranging from 2–3.5% in SEU to 0.5–1.5% in WCE, and below 0.5% in NEU and EEU (Section 13.10.3; Roson and Sartori, 2016; Takakura et al., 2017; Szewczyk et al., 2018; Dellink et al., 2019; García-León et al., 2021).
