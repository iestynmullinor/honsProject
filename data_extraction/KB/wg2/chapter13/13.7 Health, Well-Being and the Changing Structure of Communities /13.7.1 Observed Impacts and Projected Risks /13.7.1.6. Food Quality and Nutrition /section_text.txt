There is growing evidence that climate change will negatively affect food quality (diversity of food, nutrient density and food safety) and food access, although the risks for European citizens are significantly lower compared with other regions (Fanzo et al., 2018; IFPRI, 2018). Projected changes in crop and livestock production (Section 13.5.1), particularly reduced access to fruits and vegetables and foods with lower nutritional quality, will impact already vulnerable groups (Swinburn et al., 2019). The effects of climate change on food quality and access varies by income, livelihood and nutrient requirements, with low-income and more vulnerable groups in Europe most affected (IFPRI, 2018). Spikes in food prices due to changing growing conditions in Europe (Section 13.5.1), increased competition for land (e.g., land-based climate-change mitigation) and feedbacks from international markets are expected to decrease access to affordable and nutritious food (Section 13.9.1; EASAC, 2019; Loopstra, 2020). Reduced access to healthy and varied food could contribute to being overweight or obese, which is a growing health concern across Europe (Springmann et al., 2016). Increased rates of obesity and diabetes further exacerbate risks from heat-related events (EASAC, 2019).
