Extreme weather events can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression; this is well-documented for flooding in Europe (high confidence) but less for other extreme weather events. For example, in the UK, flooded residents suffered stress and identity loss from the flood event itself, but also from subsequent disputes with insurance and construction companies (Carroll et al., 2009; Greene et al., 2015). Residents displaced from their homes for at least 1 year due to 2013â€“2014 floods in England were significantly more likely  to experience PTSD, depression and anxiety, with stronger effects in the absence of advance warning (Munro et al., 2017; Waite et al., 2017). There is emerging evidence across Europe that young people may be experiencing anxiety about climate change, although it is unclear how widespread or severe this is (Hickman, 2019). In northern Italy, the number of daily emergency psychiatric visits and mean daily air temperature has been linked (Cervellin et al., 2014).
