Attribution studies show that human-induced climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and has already impacted human health in Europe (Section 13.10.1; Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2021); for example, the 2010 heatwave in EEU resulted in 55,000 heat-related deaths (Barriopedro et al., 2011; Russo et al., 2015); also, the 2018 heatwave in NEU (Ebi et al., 2021) and the 2019 heatwave in WCE and NEU both had significant health impacts (Cross-Chapter Box DISASTER in Chapter 4; Vautard et al., 2020; Watts et al., 2021). Elderly, children, (pregnant) women, socially isolated people and those with low physical fitness are particularly exposed and vulnerable to heat-related risks, as are those people suffering from pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, kidney disorders, diabetes and respiratory diseases (de’Donato et al., 2015; Sheridan and Allen, 2018; Szopa et al., 2021). An ageing population in Europe is increasing the pool of vulnerable individuals, resulting in higher risk of heat-related mortality (Montero et al., 2012; Carmona et al., 2016b; WHO, 2018b; Watts et al., 2021).A GWL of 1.5°C could result in 30,000 annual deaths due to extreme heat, with up to threefold the number under 3°C GWL (high confidence) (Roldán et al., 2015; Forzieri et al., 2017; Kendrovski et al., 2017; Naumann et al., 2020). The risk of heat stress, including mortality and discomfort, is dependent on socioeconomic development (Figure 13.22; Rohat et al., 2019; Ebi et al., 2021). Heat stress risks will be lower under SSP1 than the SSP3 or SSP4 scenarios (high confidence) (Hunt et al., 2017; Rohat et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Ebi et al., 2021). The incidence of heat-related mortality and morbidity will be highest in SEU, where their magnitude is also expected to increase more rapidly (Forzieri et al., 2017; Gasparrini et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2018; Díaz et al., 2019; Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2021). WCE, NEU and SEU will experience accelerating negative consequences beyond 1.5°C GWL, particularly under SSP3 and SSP4 due to higher vulnerability compared with SSP1 (Figure 13.22; Rohat et al., 2019). The number of heat-related respiratory hospital admissions is projected to increase from 11,000 (1981–2010) to 26,000 annually (2021–2050), particularly in SEU mainly due to a relative increase in the number of extremely hot days (Åström et al., 2013). Cold spells are projected to decrease across Europe, particularly in Southern Europe, but do not compensate for the additional heat-related deaths projected (Lhotka and Kysely, 2015; Carmona et al., 2016a; Martinez et al., 2018).Figure 13.22 | Scenario matrix for multi-model median heat stress risks for the baseline 1986–2005, and different SSP–RCP combinations for the period 2040–2060. The SSPs are extended for Europe (EU28+). Heat stress risk is calculated by geometrical aggregation of the hazard (heatwave days), population vulnerability and exposure. Risk values are normalised using a z-score rescaling with a factor-10 shift. Details of the methodology are provided by Rohat et al. (2019).Open figure Among Europeans, 74% live in urban areas (Section 13.6), where the effect of heatwaves on human health is exacerbated by microclimates due to buildings and infrastructure, UHI effects and air pollution (WHO, 2018a; Smid et al., 2019). In large European cities, stabilising climate warming at 1.5°C GWL would decrease premature deaths by 15–22% in summer compared with stabilisation at 2°C GWL (high confidence) (Mitchell et al., 2018).Although there is very high confidence that risk consequences will inevitably be more pervasive and widespread in a warmer Europe, evidence of higher heat tolerance is also emerging across most European regions (Todd and Valleron, 2015; Åström et al., 2016; Follos et al., 2020). Future projections of mortality rates in Europe under the assumption of complete acclimatisation suggest constant or even decreasing rates of mortality in spite of global warming (Åström et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2018; Díaz et al., 2019); however, there are large uncertainties in the ability to adapt to future heat extremes which might fall outside of historical ranges (Vanos et al., 2020).Other extreme events already result in major health risks across Europe. Between 2000 and 2014, for example, floods in Russia killed approximately 420 people, mainly older women (Belyakova et al., 2018). Fatalities associated with coastal and riverine flooding (Section 13.2.2), wildfires (Section 13.3.4) and windstorms could rise substantially by 2100 (Forzieri et al., 2017; Feyen et al., 2020). Lifetime exposure to extreme weather events for children born in 2020 will be about 50% greater at 3.5°C compared with 1.5°C GWL (Thiery et al., 2021).
