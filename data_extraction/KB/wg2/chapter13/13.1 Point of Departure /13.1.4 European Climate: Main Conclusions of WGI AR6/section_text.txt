Changes in several climatic-impact drivers have already emerged in all regions of Europe: increases in mean temperature and extreme heat, and decreases in cold spells (Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021). Lake and river ice has decreased in NEU, WCE and MED, and sea ice in NEUS (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). With increasing warming, confidence in projections is increasing for more drivers (Figure 13.3). Mean and maximum temperatures, frequencies of warm days and nights, and heatwaves have increased since 1950, while the corresponding cold indices have decreased (high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021). Average warming will be larger than the global mean in all of Europe, with largest winter warming in NEU and EEU and largest summer warming in MED (high confidence) (Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). An increase in hot days and a decrease in cold days are very likely  (Figure 13.4a,b). Projections suggest a substantial reduction in European ice glacier volumes and in snow cover below elevations of 1500–2000 m, as well as further permafrost thawing and degradation, during the 21st century, even at a low GWL (high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021).Figure 13.3 | Observed and projected direction of change in climate-impact drivers at 1. 5°C and 4°C GWL for European sub-regions and European seas.  (Assessment from Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021).Open figure Figure 13.4  (a,b)  number of days with temperature maximum above 35°C (TX35) and population density (European Comission, 2019); (c,d)  daily precipitation maximum (R × 1 d) and built-up area (JRCdatacatalogue, 2021); (e,f)  consecutive dry days and annual harvested rain-fed area (Portmann et al., 2010);Open figure The assessment of climate change in WGI AR6 concludes that during recent decades mean precipitation has increased over NEU, WCE and EEU, while magnitude and sign of observed trends depend substantially on time period and study region in MED (medium confidence) (Douville et al., 2021; Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). Precipitation extremes have increased in NEU and EEU (high confidence) (Seneviratne et al., 2021), vary spatially in WCE (medium confidence) and have not changed in MED (low confidence). For >2°C GWL, of mean precipitation in NEU in winter is increasing and decreasing in MED in summer (high confidence). A widespread increase of precipitation extremes is projected for >2°C GWL for all sub-regions (high confidence), except for MED where no change or decrease is projected in some areas (Figure 13.4c,d; Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). WGI assessed projections for meteorological, agricultural/ecological and hydrological drought (Ranasinghe et al., 2021) with low confidence in the direction of change in NEU, WCE and EEU at 1.5°C GWL. MED is projected to be most affected within Europe with all types of droughts increasing for 1.5°C (medium confidence) and 4°C GWL (high confidence). At 4°C GWL, hydrological droughts in NEU, WCE and EEU will increase (medium confidence). Projections for the 21st century show increases in storms across all of Europe (medium confidence) for >2°C GWL with a decrease in their frequency in the MED (Ranasinghe et al., 2021).Figure 13.4g-j | Changes in climate hazards for global warming levels of 1. 5°C and 3°C based on the CMIP6 ensemble (Gutiérrez et al., 2021) with respect to the baseline period 1995–2014, combined with information on present exposure or vulnerability:  (g,h)  sea surface temperature and marine protected areas (EEA, 2021b); and (k,l)  sea level rise (SLR) and coastal population (Merkens et al., 2016). The SLR data consider the long-term period (2081–2100) and SSP1–2.6 for (i) and SSP3–7.0 for (j).Open figure Sea surface warming between 0.25°C and 1°C has been observed in all regions over recent decades (high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021) and are projected to continue increasing (high confidence), particularly in the SEUS and at the NEUS (Figure 13.4g,h; Gutiérrez et al., 2021). Salinity has increased in the SEUS and decreased in NEUS and is projected to continue (medium confidence) (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). European waters have been, and will continue, acidifying (virtually certain) (Eyring et al., 2021; Szopa et al., 2021), resulting in a mean decrease of surface pH of about 0.1 and 0.3 pH units at 1.5°C and 3°C GWL with the largest changes at high latitudes (Gutiérrez et al., 2021).Relative sea level has risen along the European coastlines (Ranasinghe et al., 2021), regionally mitigated by post-glacial rise of land masses in Scandinavia (Fox-Kemper et al., 2021). This SLR will very likely  continue to increase during the 21st century (Figure 13.4k,l) (high confidence), with regional deviations from global mean SLR (low confidence). Extreme water levels, coastal floods and sandy coastline recession are projected to increase along many European coastlines (high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021).
