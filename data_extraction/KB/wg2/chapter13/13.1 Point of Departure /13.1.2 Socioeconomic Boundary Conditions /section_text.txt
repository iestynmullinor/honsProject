The adaptive capacity, as measured by the GDP per capita, tends to be higher in northern and western parts of Europe (Figure 13.2a). In recent decades, climate change has led to substantial losses and damages to people and assets across Europe, mostly from riverine flooding, heatwaves and storms (Figure 13.2b). Public concern about climate change, which is an indicator of the intention to mitigate and adapt, is particularly high in parts of SEU and WCE (Figure 13.2c). Current vulnerability to extreme weather and climatic events in European countries is low to moderate compared with the rest of the world (Figure 13.2d).Figure 13.2 | Indicators of reported damages to people and assets, vulnerability and adaptive capacity across European countries:  (a)  GDP per capita (average 2013â€“2018), in constant 2011 international dollars (World Bank, 2020); (b)  exposure as measured by the global rank of the Climate Risk index, which is based on economic damages and fatalities due to climate-related extreme weather events between 1999 and 2018 (Germanwatch, 2020); (c)  level of climate-change concern among a representative weighted sample of residents 15 years and older in private households (European Social Survey, 2020); and (d)  vulnerability to disasters and humanitarian crisis in 2021. The index is based on socioeconomic factors (development, inequality and aid dependency) and vulnerable groups (DRMKC, 2020).Open figure
