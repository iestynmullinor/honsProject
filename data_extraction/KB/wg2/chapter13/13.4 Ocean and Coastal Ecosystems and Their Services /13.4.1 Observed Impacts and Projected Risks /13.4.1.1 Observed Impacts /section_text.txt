Warming continues to be the key climate hazard for European seas (Figure 13.1). Interacting with other climatic and non-climatic drivers, it has detectable and attributable impacts at a wide range of biological and ecological organisational levels (Figure 13.11).Figure 13.11 | Major impacts and risks for marine and coastal ecosystems in Europe for observed and projected 1. 5°C and 3.0°C GWL (Table SM13.4)Open figure Particularly habitat loss in shallow coastal waters and at the coasts themselves, and northward distribution shifts of populations and communities, are evident across all European marine sub-regions (high confidence) (Figure 13.11; Chapter 3). Marine heatwaves have had severe ecological impacts in SEUS (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Paper 4), threatening sessile benthic biotas and coastal habitats (Munari, 2011; Kersting et al., 2013; Rivetti et al., 2014; Garrabou et al., 2019). Range contractions, extirpations (medium confidence) (Smale, 2020) and species redistributions have been observed (high confidence) in TEUS (Cottier-Cook et al., 2017) and SEUS (Castellanos-Galindo et al., 2020). Habitat losses, range shifts, species invasions and species thermal preferences have altered community compositions (Vasilakopoulos et al., 2017), resulting in the ‘subtropicalisation’ of TEUS and ‘tropicalisation’ of SEUS (Chapter 3; Cross-Chapter Paper 4) and temperature-dependent timing of abundance and reproduction cycles (Hjerne et al., 2019; Polte et al., 2021; Uriarte et al., 2021).Reductions in growth and reproductive success of calcifying species are not yet unambiguously detected and attributed in European seas (medium confidence) (Figure 13.11), as many show resilience (Kroeker et al., 2010; Wall et al., 2015). However, fish population sizes are shrinking (Queirós et al., 2018; Ikpewe et al., 2021), and growth, reproduction and recruitment are negatively impacted (Lindegren et al., 2018; Goldberg et al., 2019; Hidalgo et al., 2019; Vieira et al., 2019; Denechaud et al., 2020; Maynou et al., 2020; Polte et al., 2021), though positive effects also occur (Sguotti et al., 2019; Tanner et al., 2019). Biodiversity changes depend on region, habitat and taxon (medium confidence) (Figure 13.11) overall resulting in the redistribution of biodiversity in Europe (García Molinos et al., 2016), and biodiversity declines in some sub-regions (high confidence) (IPBES, 2018).Biological and ecological impacts have cascading effects for marine ecosystem functioning (Chivers et al., 2017; Baird et al., 2019) and biogeochemical cycling (Huete-Stauffer et al., 2011; Munari, 2011; Kersting et al., 2013; Rivetti et al., 2014; Garrabou et al., 2019). In TEUS, increased water-column stratification (Section 13.1) and decreasing eutrophication, result in reduced primary production (high confidence) (Figure 13.11; Capuzzo et al., 2018) and productivity at higher trophic levels (high confidence) (Free et al., 2019), while in NEUS sea ice decline has resulted in primary production increase by 40–60% (high confidence) (Figure 13.11; Arrigo and van Dijken, 2015; Borsheim, 2017; Lewis et al., 2020). Climate-related deoxygenation impacts are small in most European waters (medium confidence) (Figure 13.11), expect for semi-enclosed seas such as the Baltic and Black seas (Frolov et al., 2014; Jacob et al., 2014; Reusch et al., 2018). Here warming and eutrophication have altered ecosystem functioning (high confidence), reduced potential fish yield and increased harmful algal blooms (Alekseev et al., 2014; Carstensen et al., 2014; Berdalet et al., 2017; Daskalov et al., 2017; Riebesell et al., 2018; Stanev et al., 2018) along with the risks of Vibrio pathogens and vibriosis (Section 13.7.1; Baker-Austin et al., 2017; Semenza et al., 2017). Across all European seas there is only low confidence of a consistent change in provisioning ecosystem services (e.g., fishing yields) (Section 13.5), because of inter-regional variability, but high confidence in the decrease in regulating services and coastal protection because of the cascading effects of ecosystem impacts (Figure 13.11).
