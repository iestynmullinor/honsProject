Most migration and displacement due to climate change is taking place within national borders and single regions (Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). There is low confidence in climate change contributing to migration from outside Europe into Europe (Gemenne, 2011; Topilin, 2016; Gemenne and Blocher, 2017; Selby et al., 2017). Some economic models project that asylum applications to the EU might increase by a third at 2.5°C GWL and more than double beyond 4°C GWL by end of the century (Missirian and Schlenker, 2017), but empirical evidence shows that applications might decrease due to growing economic and legal barriers in the capacity of populations to emigrate from Africa or other regions (Kelley et al., 2015; Zickgraf, 2018; Borderon et al., 2019).Migration of people within Europe is predominantly triggered by economic disparities among European countries (Fischer and Pfaffermayr, 2018). There is limited evidence and low agreement  for climate-driven impacts on these movements (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Small-scale climate-induced displacement within Europe occurs in the aftermath of flood and drought disasters and over short distances (Cattaneo et al., 2019). The unequal distribution of future climate risks (Section 13.1) and adaptive capacity across European regions may increase pressure for internal migration (Williges et al., 2017; Forzieri et al., 2018). For instance, projected SLR (Section 13.2.1; Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3) may result in planned relocation of coastal settlements and inland migration in the UK, the Netherlands and the northern Mediterranean (Mulligan et al., 2014; Antonioli et al., 2017). The number of people living in areas at risk in Europe is projected to increase with future SSPs increasing exposure (Merkens et al., 2016; Byers et al., 2018; Harrison et al., 2019).
