Climate change poses a serious threat to the preservation of cultural heritage in Europe, both tangible and intangible (high confidence) (Haugen and Mattsson, 2011; Daire et al., 2012; Dupont and Van Eetvelde, 2013; Macalister, 2015; Phillips, 2015; FatoriÄ‡ and Seekamp, 2017; Graham et al., 2017; Carroll and Aarrevaara, 2018; Sesana et al., 2018; Iosub et al., 2019; Daly et al., 2020). At higher GWL, building exteriors and valuable indoor collections become at risk (Leissner et al., 2015). Coastal heritage, such as along the North Sea and Mediterranean, are under water-related threats (see Box 13.1; Cross-Chapter Paper 4; Reimann et al., 2018b; Walsh, 2018; Harkin et al., 2020).Disappearing cultural heritage can reduce incomes due to loss of tourism (Hall et al., 2016), as exemplified by glacier retreat, for example, in the Swiss Alps and Greenland (CCP5.3.2.4; Bjorst and Ren, 2015; Bosson et al., 2019). Glacier retreat can create a sense of discomfort, loss of sense of place, displacement and anxiety in people (Section 13.7; Albrecht et al., 2007; Brugger et al., 2013; Allison, 2015; Jurt et al., 2015). Intangible cultural heritage, such as place names, and lost traditional practices can also be affected (Mustonen, 2018; Dastgerdi et al., 2019).
