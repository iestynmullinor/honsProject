A number of livelihoods maintaining unique cultures in Europe are particularly vulnerable to climate change (Table 13.2): indigenous communities in the European polar region because of their dependence on cryosphere ecosystems (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Paper 6; Hayashi, 2017; Huntington et al., 2017; Hock et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019; Inuit Circumpolar Council, 2020; Douville et al., 2021; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021) and communities dependent on small-scale fisheries, traditional farming and unique cultural landscapes (medium confidence) (Kovats et al., 2014; Ruiz-Díaz et al., 2020).Table 13.2 | Examples of losses and damages to vulnerable livelihoods in Europe, differentiated by category according to non-economic loss and damage (Table SM13.20)For Sámi reindeer, herding impacts cascade due to a lack of access to key ecosystems, lakes and rivers, thereby threatening traditional livelihoods, food security, cultural heritage (e.g., burial grounds, seasonal dwellings and routes), mental health (see Box 13.2; Figure 13.13; Feodoroff, 2021) and growing costs, for example, as a result of the need for artificial feeding of reindeer.
