As climate change is interacting with many other drivers of poverty, improving the social position of the currently poor may increase their climate resilience (low confidence) (Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 2017; Fronzek et al., 2019). Some adaptation actions have the potential to alleviate poverty (Section 13.11.3), but adaptation can also increase social inequalities, for instance, when practices of disaster recovery focus on high-visibility areas and not on low-income neighbourhoods or marginalised communities (D’Alisa and Kallis, 2016). Risk communication and management reliant on new information technologies can exclude the elderly and populations with lower educational attainment (Kešetović et al., 2017).Unlike migration within the EU, migration from outside Europe to Europe is heavily constrained by restrictive migration and asylum policies (Fielding, 2011; Mulligan et al., 2014), eventually leaving people to stay in more exposed and risk-prone regions (Benveniste et al., 2020). To reduce vulnerability in these regions, Europe can contribute to adaptation and development in regions outside Europe (Section 13.9.4).IKLK, embedded, for example, in fishers, farmers and navigators, can be a vehicle for detecting, monitoring and observing impacts (Section 13.11.1.3; Arctic Council, 2013; Brattland and Mustonen, 2018 ; Madine et al., 2018; Meredith et al., 2019). Regarding risks to northern traditional livelihoods and indigenous communities, small-scale adaptation is taking place, for example, by ecological restoration of habitats (Section 13.3; Mustonen and Kontkanen, 2019); however, limited access to resources outside the jurisdictions of the communities limits the scope of community-based adaptation (Arctic Council, 2013; Mustonen et al., 2018; Meredith et al., 2019).European cultural heritage in general and world heritage sites specifically lack adaptation strategies to preserve key cultural assets (Haugen and Mattsson, 2011; Howard, 2013; Heathcote et al., 2017; Reimann et al., 2018b; Harkin et al., 2020). Key reasons are the underdeveloped adaptation actions available, resources for implementing them and the absence of overarching policy guidance (Phillips, 2015; Fernandes et al., 2017; Sesana et al., 2018; Daly et al., 2020; Fatorić and Biesbroek, 2020; Sesana et al., 2020).
