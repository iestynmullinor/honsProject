There is limited understanding of how different social groups are affected by the four European key risks under future climate change (Section 13.11.2), and by adaptation to them. Similarly, the interaction of multiple risks across sectors and how this interaction results in displacement, migration or immobility of people both within and from outside Europe is insufficiently understood. For indigenous and traditional livelihoods in Europe, the understanding of how risks will change at different warming levels is very limited, due to complex interactions with socioeconomic and political change. For European cultural heritage, there is also a lack of tailored knowledge and understanding of the impacts and how to translate them into adaptation measures.
