Since AR5, scientific documentation of observed changes attributed to global warming have proliferated (high confidence). These include ecosystem changes detected in previous assessments, such as earlier annual greening and onset of faunal reproduction processes, relocation of species towards higher latitudes and altitudes (high confidence), and impacts of heat on human health and productivity (high confidence) (Figure 13.27; Table SM13.22; Vicedo-Cabrera et al., 2021). Formal attribution of impacts of compound events to anthropogenic climate change is just emerging, for example, in the recent crop failures due to heat and drought (Toreti et al., 2019a). Also, there is high agreement  and medium evidence that particular events attributed to climate change have induced cascading impacts and other impact interactions (Smale et al., 2019; Vogel et al., 2019). In recent decades (2000â€“2015), economic losses intensified in SEU (high confidence) and were detected for parts of WCE and NEU (medium confidence). (The methodology for detection and attribution is presented in Section 16.2.)Figure 13.27 | Detected changes and attribution (D&A) of climate-related impacts on land (top) and in the ocean (bottom) are shown. Assessment is based on peer-reviewed literature in this chapter that reported observed evidence with at least 90% significance (usually with 95% significance or more) (Table SM13.22).Open figure
