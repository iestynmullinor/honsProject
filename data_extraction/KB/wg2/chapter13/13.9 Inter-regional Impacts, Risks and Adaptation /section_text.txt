European countries can address inter-regional risks at the place of origin or destination, for example, by (a) developing local adaptation capacity in trading-partner countries and in European territories outside Europe (Petit and Prudent, 2008; Benzie et al., 2019; Adams et al., 2020; Terorotua et al., 2020), (b) providing international adaptation finance (Dzebo and Stripple, 2015; BMUB, 2017), (c) developing insurance mechanisms suitable for adaptation or (d) providing European climate services to support global adaptation (Cross-Chapter Box INTEREG in Chapter 16; Linnerooth-Bayer and Mechler, 2015; Brasseur and Gallardo, 2016; Street, 2016; Cavelier et al., 2017). Along the supply chain, risks can be reduced by trade diversification and alternative sourcing (Benzie and Persson, 2019; Adams et al., 2020). Within Europe, risks can be reduced by integrating inter-regional climate risks into national adaptation strategies and plans, and mainstreaming them into EU policies (e.g., Common Agricultural Policy, trade agreements) (Benzie and Persson, 2019; Benzie et al., 2019; Groundstroem and Juhola, 2019; Adams et al., 2020). There is high confidence that the exposure of European countries to inter-regional risks can be reduced by international governance (Cross-Chapter Paper 4; Dzebo and Stripple, 2015; Cramer et al., 2018; Persson and Dzebo, 2019), for example, fulfilling the targets of environmental agreements such as the Convention for Biological Diversity (IPBES, 2018). There is emerging evidence that supporting adaptation outside Europe may generate economic co-benefits for Europe (Rom√°n et al., 2018).
