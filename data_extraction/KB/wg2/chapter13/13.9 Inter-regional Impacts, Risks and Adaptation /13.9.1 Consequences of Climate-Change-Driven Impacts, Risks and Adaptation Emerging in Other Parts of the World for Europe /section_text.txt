Recent literature (Wenz and Levermann, 2016; Hedlund et al., 2018; Benzie et al., 2019) strengthens the confidence in the AR5 statement that ‘with increasing globalisation, the impacts of climate change outside the European region are likely  to have implications for countries within the region’ (Kovats et al., 2014). The exposure of European countries to trans-European climate impact and risk pathways varies depending on their territorial settings, national policies and position in the global supply chain (high confidence) (Berry et al., 2015; Hedlund et al., 2018; Benzie et al., 2019). There is limited evidence that Europe is more exposed to inter-regional risks than North America, and less than Africa and Asia (Hedlund et al., 2018). The social and governance context in Europe make the region less vulnerable to conflicts driven by climate change than other regions, at least up to 2°C GWL (Buhaug et al., 2014; Mach et al., 2019; Ide et al., 2020).Climate risks in other parts of the world can be transmitted to European economies via trade networks (Figure 13.25). European agricultural imports exert a high water footprint in originating countries already today (Dolganova et al., 2019; Ercin et al., 2019), and some crop imports, such as tropical fruits, are highly vulnerable to future climate change (Brás et al., 2019). Simultaneous breadbasket failures, and trade restrictions, increase risks to food supply (medium confidence) (Fellmann et al., 2014; d’Amour et al., 2016; Gaupp et al., 2017; Gaupp et al., 2020). There is high confidence that the European economy could be negatively affected by supply chain disruptions due to flooding destroying facilities, heatwaves and malaria reducing productivity in labour-intensive industries and regions (Section 13.7.1), and SLR affecting ports and cities along coastlines (Section 13.6.1.2; Nicholls and Kebede, 2012; Challinor, 2016; Wenz and Levermann, 2016; Hedlund et al., 2018; Koks, 2018; Szewczyk et al., 2018; Willner et al., 2018; Knittel et al., 2020; Kulmer et al., 2020; Carter et al., 2021).Figure 13.25 | Trans-European climate risks in trade: virtual water flows embodied in agricultural imports to Europe in 2018 and the vulnerability to climate change of the most important crops in the originating countries (Dolganova et al., 2019; Ercin et al., 2019)  Open figure
