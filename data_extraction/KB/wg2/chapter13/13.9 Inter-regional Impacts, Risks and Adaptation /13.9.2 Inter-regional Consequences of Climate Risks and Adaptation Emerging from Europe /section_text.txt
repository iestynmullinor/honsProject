New literature since AR5 suggests that climate risks in Europe can propagate worldwide in response to 3°C GWL (medium confidence). Key concerns include climate impacts on European agriculture threatening global food security (Section 13.5.1; Berry et al., 2017; van der Velde et al., 2018) and the European demand limiting the adaptation potential for ecosystems in South America, Africa and Asia (IPBES, 2018; Pendrill et al., 2019; Fuchs et al., 2020). Emerging literature suggests that coastal and riverine flood risks in Europe could be amplified through the global financial system and generate a systemic financial crisis (Figure 13.26; Mandel et al., 2021). For 3°C GWL and without adaptation, northern Atlantic flight routes and European ports are projected to be increasingly disrupted by changing winds, waves and SLR (Section 13.6.1.2; Williams and Joshi, 2013; Irvine et al., 2016; Williams, 2016; Becker et al., 2018; Camus et al., 2019; Verschuur et al., 2020).Figure 13.26 | The transmission of coastal and riverine flood risks via finance flows from Europe to the rest of the world.
