European territories outside Europe are critically exposed to climate risks such as increased forest fires (e.g., in Russian Siberia) (Chapter 10; Sitnov et al., 2017), climate-change-induced biodiversity losses and SLR (e.g., in British, Spanish, Portuguese, French and Dutch overseas regions and territories) (Chapters 12, 15; Ferdinand, 2018; Sieber et al., 2018). Climate risks emerging from these territories include smoke and dust from Siberian forest fires (Sitnov et al., 2017) and, depending on European health-risk mitigation measures, dengue and other mosquito-transmitted diseases (Section 13.7; Schaffner and Mathis, 2014). Some MPAs (Section 13.4.3) in European overseas territories are increasingly affected by changes originating in far-field upstream areas. These changes ultimately undermine their ability to curb biodiversity losses and provide ecosystem services (Schaffner and Mathis, 2014; Robinson et al., 2017). Adaptation options and regulations developed within Europe apply in these territories, despite low confidence that they meet local and regional adaptation challenges and address the aspiration for social justice, promotion of local solutions and consideration of traditional knowledge (Ferdinand, 2018; Terorotua et al., 2020).
