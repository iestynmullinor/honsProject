Heat and humidity affect livestock, such as dairy cows and goats, directly exposed in open barns and outdoors (Gauly et al., 2013; Bernabucci et al., 2014; Silanikove and Koluman, 2015), and cold-adapted husbandry (high confidence) (see Box 13.2; Section 13.8.3). Heat impacts animal health (Sanker et al., 2013; Lambertz et al., 2014), nutrition, behaviour and welfare (Heinicke et al., 2019), performance and product quality (Gauly and Ammer, 2020). Climate change also impacts grassland production, fodder composition and quality, particularly in SEU (Dumont et al., 2015) and EEU (Bezuglova et al., 2020), as well as alters the prevalence, distribution and load of pathogens and their vectors (high confidence) (Section 2.4.2.7.3; Morgan et al., 2013; Charlier et al., 2016). Projected impacts on poultry and pigs are low due to temperature control in large parts of Europe, but are greater in SEU where open systems prevail (Chapter 5).Warming increases the pasture growing season and farming period in NEU and at higher altitudes (Fuhrer et al., 2014), while longer drought periods and thunderstorms can influence abandonment of remote Alpine pastures, reducing cultural and landscape ecosystem services and losing traditional farming practices (high confidence) (Section 13.8.3; Herzog and Seidl, 2018). At 2–4°C GWL grassland biomass production for forage-fed animals will increase in NEU and the northern Alps, while forage production will decrease in SEU and the southern Alps due to heat and water scarcity (Gauly et al., 2013; Jäger et al., 2020), causing regional reductions of cow milk production in WCE and SEU (high confidence) (Silanikove and Koluman, 2015).
