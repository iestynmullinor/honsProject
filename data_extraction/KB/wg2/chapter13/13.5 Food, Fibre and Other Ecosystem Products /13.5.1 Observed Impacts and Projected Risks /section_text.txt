Climate change is altering the structure and function of European forests via changes in temperature, precipitation and atmospheric CO2, as well as through interaction with pests and fire (high confidence) (Section 13.3.1; Moreno et al., 2018; Morin et al., 2018; Senf et al., 2018; Orlova-Bienkowskaja et al., 2020). Species-specific responses of trees to drier summers (Vitali et al., 2018) shape regional variability in European forest productivity in response to water and nutrient availability, heatwave and evaporative demand (Reyer et al., 2014; Kellomäki et al., 2018). While warming and extended growing seasons have positive impacts on forest growth in cold areas in WCE and NEU (Pretzsch et al., 2014; Matskovsky et al., 2020), EEU (Tei et al., 2017) and higher altitude (Sedmáková et al., 2019), drought stress across Europe has been increasing (high confidence) (Primicia et al., 2015; Marqués et al., 2018; Ruiz-Pérez and Vico, 2020). Combined with land use, climate change has increased large-scale forest mortality since the 1980s (Senf et al., 2018). Extreme events, such as the 2018 drought in WCE, caused widespread leaf shedding and tree mortality (Buras et al., 2020) with carryovers into 2019 (Schuldt et al., 2020), as well as bark beetle outbreaks (Netherer et al., 2019) resulting in felling and cutting of more than 1 million ha of spruce forest and disrupting timber markets (Mauser, 2021).In response to 3°C GWL, forest productivity is projected to increase in NEU and altitudes, show mixed trends in WCE and decrease in SEU (medium confidence) (Reyer et al., 2014). This trend is driven by increases in productivity of pine and spruce, and decreases of beech and oak, and excludes disturbances and management options (Reyer et al., 2014). Water stress exacerbates the incidence from and effects of fire and other natural disturbances (Section 13.3.1), resulting in forest productivity declines or cancelling out productivity gains from CO2 (high confidence) (Seidl et al., 2014; Reyer et al., 2017). In response to 1.7°C GLW, managed forest and unmanaged woodland areas are projected to decrease only minimally, while at GWL >2.5°C losses are increasing for managed forest and unmanaged woodland (Harrison et al., 2019). Reducing warming from 4°C GLW to below 1.7°C GLW would reduce the Europe-wide impacts on managed forest by 34% (Harrison et al., 2019).
