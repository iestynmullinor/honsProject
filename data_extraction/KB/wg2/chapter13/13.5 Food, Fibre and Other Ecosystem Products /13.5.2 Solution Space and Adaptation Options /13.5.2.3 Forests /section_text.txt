Forest management has been adopted as a frequent strategy to cope with drought, reduce fire risk, and maintain biodiverse landscapes and rural jobs (Hlásny et al., 2014; Fernández-Manjarrés et al., 2018). Successful adaptation strategies include altering the tree species composition to enhance the resilience of European forests (high confidence) (Schelhaas et al., 2015; Zubizarreta-Gerendiain et al., 2017; Pukkala, 2018). Greater diversity of tree species reduces vulnerability to pests and pathogens (Felton et al., 2016), and increases resistance to natural disturbances (high confidence) (Jactel et al., 2017; Pukkala, 2018; Pardos et al., 2021). Depending on forest successional history (Sheil and Bongers, 2020), tree composition change can increase carbon sequestration (high confidence) (Liang et al., 2016), biodiversity and water quality (Felton et al., 2016). Conservation areas can also help climate-change adaptation by keeping the forest cover intact, creating favourable microclimates and protecting biodiversity (low confidence) (Jantke et al., 2016).Reforestation reduces warming rates (Zellweger et al., 2020) and extremely warm days (Sonntag et al., 2016) inside forests, reducing natural disturbances and fires (high confidence). Active management approaches can limit the impact of fires (Section 13.3.1) on forest productivity, including fuel reduction management, prescribed burning, changing from conifers to deciduous, less flammable species, and recreating mixed forests (Feyen et al., 2020) and agroforestry (Damianidis et al., 2020).
