Climate-resilient fish production in Europe is the goal of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) rebuilding fish stocks to MSY levels, but success has been variable (Froese et al., 2018; Stecf, 2019). Adaptation is largely ignored in related EU policy frameworks such as the CFP, the MSFD and the ‘Strategic guidelines for the sustainable development of EU aquaculture’. (Pham et al., 2021). A major governance challenge for adaptation will be the redistribution of the fixed allocation scheme for total allowable catches (Harte et al., 2019; Baudron et al., 2020). Inflexible and non-adaptive allocation schemes can result in conflicts among European countries (medium confidence), as demonstrated by the case of the Northeast Atlantic mackerel (Spijkers and Boonstra, 2017).The development of adaptation strategies for seafood production since the Paris Agreement is insufficient in Europe (high confidence) (Kalikoski et al., 2018; Pham et al., 2021). Concrete plans for adaptation planning towards climate-ready fisheries and aquaculture are lacking in all parts of Europe (European Comission, 2018), especially accounting for the expected reduced landings of traditional target species and in preparation for a new portfolio of resource species (Blanchet et al., 2019).Recent scientific progress towards adaptation in European fisheries and aquaculture include conceptual guidance and demonstration cases on climate adaptation planning (Pham et al., 2021) and climate vulnerability assessments (Blanchet et al., 2019; Peck et al., 2020; Payne et al., 2021). Sociopolitical scenarios for European aquatic resources have been developed and have the potential to inform adaptation planning by European fisheries and aquaculture sectors (Kreiss et al., 2020; Hamon et al., 2021; Pinnegar et al., 2021).
