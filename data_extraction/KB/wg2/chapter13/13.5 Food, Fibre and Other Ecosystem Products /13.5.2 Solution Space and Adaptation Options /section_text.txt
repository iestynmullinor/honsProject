An increasing globalised food system makes European nations sensitive to supply chain disturbances in other parts of the world, but also provides capacity to adapt to production shifts within Europe through changes in international trade (Section 13.9.1) (Alexander et al., 2018; Challinor et al., 2018; Ercin et al., 2021). Consumer demand for food and timber products can adapt to productivity changes and be mediated by price (e.g., in response to production changes or policies on food-related taxation), reflect changes in preferences (e.g., towards plant-based foods motivated by environmental, ethical or health concerns) or reductions in food waste (high confidence) (Alexander et al., 2019; Willett et al., 2019). Although mitigation potentials of dietary changes have received increasing attention, evidence is lacking on potential for adaptation through changes in European food consumption and trade, despite these socioeconomic factors being a strong driver for change (medium confidence) (Harrison et al., 2019; Kebede, 2021). Calls are increasing across Europe for sustainable and resilient agri-food systems acknowledging interdependencies between producers and consumers to deliver healthy, safe and nutritional foods and services (Section 13.7) (Venghaus and Hake, 2018).
