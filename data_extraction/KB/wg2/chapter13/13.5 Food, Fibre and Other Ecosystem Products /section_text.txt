Aggregated projections of impacts, especially of combined hazards, are still rare despite many physiological papers on species-specific responses to warming in all food sectors (high confidence). This is specifically true for scenarios that consider land-use change and population growth, although Agri SSPs are currently being developed (Mitter et al., 2019). Effectiveness of adaptation options is predominantly qualitatively mentioned but not assessed, and the effectiveness of combinations of measures is rarely assessed (high confidence) (Ewert et al., 2015; Holman et al., 2018; Müller et al., 2020). Effective adaptation planning would be supported by better modelling and scenario development including improved coupled nature–human interactions (e.g., with more realistic representation of behaviours beyond economic rationality and ‘bottom-up’ autonomous farmer adaptations) as well as greater stakeholder involvement.Coverage of impacts and adaptation options in Europe are biased towards the EU-28 and have gaps within the eastern part of WCE and EEU, despite dramatic changes in land use over recent decades in Russia and Ukraine (high confidence) which have the potential to increase production and export of agricultural products, especially wheat, meat and milk (Swinnen et al., 2017).A bias towards modelling of cereals, specifically wheat and maize, results in gaps in knowledge for fruit and vegetables, especially for temperate regions in Europe (Bisbis et al., 2019). The assessment of irrigation needs and the impact of CO2 and O3 tend to focus on individual species and processes hindering upscaling to multiple stressors and mixed production (high confidence) (Challinor et al., 2016 ; Webber et al., 2016).There is a lack of actionable adaptation strategies for European fisheries and aquaculture. Knowledge gaps include adaptive capacities of local fishing communities to a new mix of target species and consumer acceptance of the product. Increased knowledge on the effects on freshwater fisheries and their resources is also needed.
