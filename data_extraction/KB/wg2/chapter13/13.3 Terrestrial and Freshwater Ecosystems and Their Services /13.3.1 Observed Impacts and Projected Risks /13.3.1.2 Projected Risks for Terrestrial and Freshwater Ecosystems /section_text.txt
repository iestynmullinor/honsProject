Risks for terrestrial ecosystems will increase with warming (very high confidence) with high impacts at >2.4°C GWL and very high impacts >3.5°C GWL (medium confidence) (Section 13.10.3.1). Land-use changes will increase extirpation and extinction risk (very high confidence) (Vermaat et al., 2017). In NEU, biodiversity vulnerability is projected to be lower as new climate and habitat space is becoming available (Warren et al., 2018; Harrison et al., 2019). Warming <1.5°C GWL would limit risks to biodiversity, while 4°C GWL and intensive land use could lead to a loss of suitable climate and habitat space for most species (low confidence) (Warren et al., 2018; Harrison et al., 2019).Disruption of habitat connectivity reduces resilience and is projected to impact 30% of lake and river catchments in Europe by 2030, through drought and reduced river flows (medium evidence) (Markovic et al., 2017). Average wetland area is not projected to change at 1.7°C GWL across Europe, while for >4°C GWL expanding sites in NEU are not sufficient to balance losses in SEU and WCE (high confidence) (Xi et al., 2021). At 3°C GWL the alpine tundra habitat and its associated species are projected to be lost in the Pyrenees and shrink dramatically in NEU, WCE and EEU (Anisimov et al., 2017; Barredo et al., 2020).Population range shifts (Figures 13.7, 13.10) are projected to continue (medium confidence at 1.5° GWL, high confidence at 3.0°C GWL) (Figure 13.8). The largest losses of suitable climatic conditions are projected for plants and insects, with different taxon-specific regions of highest risk, while proportions of species projected to lose suitable climates are lower for other groups (medium confidence) (Figure Box 13.1.1; Table SM13.3; Warren et al., 2018). Temperatures >1.5°C GWL will lead to a progressive subtropicalisation in SEU, expanding into WCE at >3°C GWL, a northward shift in the temperate domain into NEU (medium confidence) (Feyen et al., 2020) and an expansion of desert biomes in EEU (Sergienko and Konstantinov, 2016). Changes in distribution are projected for major tree species in all European regions at 1.7°C GWL (Dyderski et al., 2018; Leskinen et al., 2020), with economic implications for managed forests (Section 13.5.1.4). The longer growth season in NEU and WCE will support the establishment of invasive species (Cross-Chapter Paper 1). Temperatures <1.5°C GWL would limit expansion and novel appearances of pests, while >3.4°C GWL would make large parts of SEU and WCE suitable for pests, for example, wood beetles (Urvois et al., 2021), and increase economic losses due to lower harvest quality of timber (Toth et al., 2020).Risks emerging from climate change for phenology are uncertain, given asynchrony between species, taxa and trophic responses (Thackeray et al., 2016; Posledovich et al., 2018; Keogan et al., 2021) and the complexity of phenological events and their cues (medium confidence) (Delgado et al., 2020; Ettinger et al., 2020). Spring events may continue to occur earlier (Gaüzère et al., 2016), but reduced chilling may decrease this temporal shift (Wang et al., 2020). Projections for autumn are mixed, with continuing delays (Prislan et al., 2019) or earlier onset of leaf senescence (Wu et al., 2018), but reduced chilling may also decrease these developments (Wang et al., 2020). Advancement, combined with longer autumn growth, may extend the growing season of trees by two days per decade in SEU (Prislan et al., 2019). Warming to >3°C GWL will impact forest planning in NEU (Caffarra et al., 2014).
