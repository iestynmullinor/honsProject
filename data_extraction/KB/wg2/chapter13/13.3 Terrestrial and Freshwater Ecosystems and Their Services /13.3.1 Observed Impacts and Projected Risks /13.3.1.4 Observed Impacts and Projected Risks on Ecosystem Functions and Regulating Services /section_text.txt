European temperate and boreal forests, wetlands and peatlands hold important carbon stocks (Bukvareva and Zamolodchikov, 2016; Yousefpour et al., 2018). Effects of warming and increasing droughts on soil moisture, respiration and carbon sequestration have been detected across European regions (high confidence) (Figure 13.8; Sanginés de Cárcer et al., 2018; Carnicer et al., 2019; Green et al., 2019; Schuldt et al., 2020). Forest expansion in boreal regions results in net warming (Bright et al., 2017), possibly influencing cloud formation and rainfall patterns (medium confidence) (Teuling et al., 2017). These changes are affecting climate, pollination and soil protection services (Figure 13.8; Verhagen et al., 2018). If not managed through increased reforestation and/or revegetation or peatland restoration, future climate-change impacts will progressively limit the climate regulation capacity of European terrestrial ecosystems (medium confidence) (Figure 13.8), especially in SEU (Peñuelas et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019). Predominantly positive CO2 fertilisation effects at current warming will change into increasingly negative effects of warming and drought on forests at higher temperatures (medium confidence) (Peñuelas et al., 2017; Green et al., 2019; Ito et al., 2020; Wang 2020; Yu et al., 2021). In NEU and EEU, peatlands are projected to shrink with 1.7°C GWL, and become carbon sources at 3°C GWL (Qiu et al., 2020), peat bogs to lose 50% carbon at 2°C GWL, and blanket peatland to shrink or regionally disappear (Gallego-Sala et al., 2010; Ferretto et al., 2019).Declines in pollinator ranges in response to climate change are occurring for many groups in Europe (high confidence) (Figure Box 13.1.1; Figure 13.8; Kerr et al., 2015; Soroye et al., 2020; Zattara and Aizen, 2020), with observed shifts to higher elevations in southern and lower elevation in northern species (Kerr et al., 2015) resulting in higher pollinator richness in NEU (Franzén and Öckinger, 2012). Lags in responses to climate change suggest that current impacts on pollination have not been fully realised (IPBES, 2018). Pollinators are also declining due to lack of suitable habitat, pollution, pesticides, pathogens and competing invasive alien species (Settele et al., 2016; Steele et al., 2019).Projected climate impacts on pollinators show mixed responses across Europe but are greater under 3°C GWL (medium confidence) (Rasmont et al., 2015). Increasing homogenisation of populations may increase vulnerability to extreme events (Vasiliev and Greenwood, 2021). Geographical changes to the climatic niche of pollinators are similar to those of insects, with mixed trends, depending on group and location (Figure 13.9; Kaloveloni et al., 2015; Rasmont et al., 2015; Radenković et al., 2017). In NEU, species richness may increase for some groups (Rasmont et al., 2015), with unclear trends for bumblebees (Fourcade et al., 2019; Soroye et al., 2020). Future land use will have important effects on pollinator distribution (Marshall, 2018) as habitat fragmentation in densely populated Europe decreases opportunities for range shifts and microclimatic buffering (Vasiliev and Greenwood, 2021).Soil erosion varies across Europe, with higher rates in parts of SEU and WCE, but lower rates in NEU (high confidence) (Figure 13.8; Petz et al., 2016; Polce et al., 2016; Borrelli et al., 2020), related to vegetation type and amount of cover, slope and soil type (Panagos et al., 2015a). Short-term land-use change and management may impact soil erosion more than climate (Verhagen et al., 2018). Where conservation agriculture is practised or vegetation cover increasing, erosion is slightly decreasing (Panagos et al., 2015b; Guerra et al., 2016). Reduced soil loss due to reduced spring snowmelt has been observed in EEU (Golosov et al., 2018), while fire exacerbates soil loss especially in SEU (Borrelli et al., 2016; Borrelli et al., 2017).Projected increase in rainfall could increase soil erosion, while warming enhances vegetation cover, leading to overall mixed responses (medium confidence) (Berberoglu et al., 2020; Ciampalini et al., 2020). In Europe, rainfall erosion could increase by >81% (Panagos et al., 2017) at 2°C GWL, especially in NEU (Borrelli et al., 2020) where risks can be limited by soil erosion control (Polce et al., 2016). Decreased rainfall projected for parts of SEU could reduce erosion, although increases in rainfall intensity could offset this (Serpa et al., 2015). Soil losses from fire will increase in SEU in response to 2°C GWL (Pastor et al., 2019), especially if combined with extreme rainfall (Morán-Ordóñez et al., 2020). In northern regions, reduced soil losses are projected during spring snowmelt (Svetlitchnyi, 2020).
