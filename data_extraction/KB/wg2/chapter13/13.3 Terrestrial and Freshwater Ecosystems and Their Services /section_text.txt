Despite growing evidence of climate-change impacts and risks, including attributed changes to terrestrial ecosystems (Section 13.10.1), this information is geographically not equally distributed, leaving clear gaps for some processes or regions (high confidence). For processes such as wildfire, the Fire Weather index (Section 13.3.1.3) suggests increasing risk of fires in Europe, but robust projections on incidents and magnitudes of wildfire and their impacts on ecosystems and other sectors is currently limited, particularly for NEU, EEU and WCE (high confidence).Many studies consider only individual climate drivers, though new research shows strong interactions between hazards such as warming and drought (Section 13.3.1), as well as non-climatic drivers (Chapter 2). This creates uncertainty about the emergence of extinctions and the magnitudes of impacts for European ecosystems and the services they provide (high confidence), such as pollination on food production. RCP-SSP combinations to assess risks are only just emerging (Harrison et al., 2019).Assessments of the long-term effectiveness of adaptation actions are missing, due to the time lag in determining the effectiveness of an action and attributing risk reduction (Morecroft et al., 2019). For example, many landscape restoration actions have been discussed, but it is unclear which would bring the greatest benefits and which species should be used for the restoration (Ockendon et al., 2018). Furthermore, adaptation actions will depend on local implementation and benefit from being assessed using cultural and Indigenous knowledge where applicable, but this is hardly studied (medium confidence).
