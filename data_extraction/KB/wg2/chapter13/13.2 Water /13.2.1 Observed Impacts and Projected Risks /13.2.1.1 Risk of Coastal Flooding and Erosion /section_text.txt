Almost 50 million Europeans live within 10 m above mean sea level (Vousdoukas et al., 2020; McEvoy et al., 2021). Without further adaptation (Section 13.2.2), flood risks along Europe’s low-lying coasts and estuaries will increase due to SLR compounded by storm surges, rainfall and river runoff (high confidence) (Mokrech et al., 2015; Arns et al., 2017; Sayol and Marcos, 2018; Vousdoukas et al., 2018a; Bevacqua et al., 2019; Couasnon et al., 2020). The population at risk of a 100-year flood event starts to rapidly increase beyond 2040 (Vousdoukas et al., 2018a) reaching 10 million people under RCP8.5 by 2100, but it stays just below 10 million people under RCP2.6 by 2150 (Figure 13.5; Haasnoot et al., 2021b) assuming present population and protection. The number of people at risk is projected to increase and risk to materialise earlier especially in response to increasing population under SSP5 (Vousdoukas et al., 2018a; Haasnoot et al., 2021b). Under high rates of SLR resulting from rapid ice sheet loss from Antarctica, risks may increase by a third by 2150 (Haasnoot et al., 2021b). Expected annual (direct) damages due to coastal flooding are projected to rise from 1.3 billion EUR today to 13–39 billion EUR by 2050 between 2°C and 2.5°C GWL and 93–960 billion EUR by 2100 between 2.5° and 4.4°C GWL, largely depending on socioeconomic developments (Cross-Chapter Box SLR in Chapter 3; Vousdoukas et al., 2018a) (high confidence in the sign; low confidence in the numbers). UNESCO World Heritage sites in the coastal zone are at risk due to SLR, coastal erosion and flooding (Section 13.8.1.3; Cross-Chapter Paper 4; Marzeion and Levermann, 2014; Reimann et al., 2018b) as are coastal landfills and other key infrastructures in Europe (AR6/SROCC; Brand et al., 2018; Beaven et al., 2020).Figure 13.5 | Sea level rise (SLR) vulnerability and national planning in Europe:  (a)  map of countries in Europe summarising the amount of SLR each country is planning for, at different time horizons (blue bars), and the present population (2020) at risk of a 100-year coastal flood event (orange bars) (Haasnoot et al., 2021b). The amounts of SLR and time horizons reflect national guidance or planning (local or project-based levels may differ) (McEvoy et al., 2021); (b)  projected population at risk to experience a 1-in-10-year coastal flood event under RCP2.6-SSP1 and RCP8.5-SSP5 assuming present protection and population levels, as well as population change according to, respectively, SSP1 and SSP5, based on Merkens (2016); (c)  projected population at risk to experience a 1-in-100-year coastal flood event under RCP2.6-SSP1 and RCP8.5-SSP5, assuming the present protection and population levels, as well as population change according to, respectively, SSP1 and SSP5, based on Merkens (2016) (based on Haasnoot et al., 2021b).Open figure Observations indicate that soft cliffs and beaches are most affected by erosion in Europe with, for example, 27–40% of Europe’s sandy coast eroding today, without climate change being identified as the main driver so far (Pranzini et al., 2015; Luijendijk et al., 2018; Mentaschi et al., 2018; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). SLR will increase coastal erosion of sandy shorelines (high confidence) (Ranasinghe et al., 2021), but there is low confidence in quantitative values assessment of erosion rates and amounts (Athanasiou et al., 2019; Le Cozannet et al., 2019; Thieblemont et al., 2019). Without nourishment or other natural or artificial barriers to erosion, sandy shorelines could retreat by about 100 m in Europe at 4°C GWL; limiting warming to 3°C GWL could reduce this value by one-third (Vousdoukas et al., 2020).
