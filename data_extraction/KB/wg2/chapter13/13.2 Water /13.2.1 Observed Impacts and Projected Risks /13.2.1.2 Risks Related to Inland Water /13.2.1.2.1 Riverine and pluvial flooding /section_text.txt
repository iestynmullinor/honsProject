Precipitation has raised river flood hazards in WCE and the UK by 11% per decade from 1960 to 2010 and decreased in EEU and SEU by 23% per decade (Douville et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). The most recent three decades had the highest number of floods in the past 500 years with increases in summer (Blöschl et al., 2020). Economic flood damages increased strongly, reflecting increasing exposure of people and assets (Visser et al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Merz et al., 2021).Projections indicate a continuation of the observed trends of river flood hazards in WCE (high confidence) of 10% at 2°C GWL and 18% at 4.4°C GWL, and a decrease in NEU and SEU (medium confidence) with, respectively, 5 and 11% in NEU and SEU for a 100-year peak flow, making Europe one of the regions with the largest projected increase in flood risk (Di Sante et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). While there is disagreement on the magnitude of economic losses and people affected, there is high agreement  on direction of change, particularly in WCE (Alfieri et al., 2018). New research increases confidence in AR5 statements that without adaptation measures, increases in extreme rainfall will substantially increase direct flood damages (e.g., Madsen et al., 2014; Alfieri et al., 2015a; Alfieri et al., 2015b; Blöschl et al., 2017; Dottori et al., 2020; Mentaschi et al., 2020). With low adaptation, damages from river flooding are projected to be three times higher at 1.5°C GWL, four times at 2°C GWL and six times at 3°C GWL (Alfieri et al., 2018; Dottori et al., 2020). At 2°C GWL, the incidence of summer floods is expected to decrease across the whole alpine region, whereas winter and spring floods will increase due to extreme precipitation (Gobiet et al., 2014) and snowmelt-driven runoff (Coppola et al., 2018).Pluvial flooding and flash floods due to intense rainfall constitute most flood events in SEU and a substantial risk in other European regions (Cross-Chapter Paper 4; Llasat et al., 2016; Rudd et al., 2020). The majority (56%) of flood events between 1860 and 2016 were flash floods (Paprotny et al., 2018a). These floods had considerable impacts including danger to human lives, for example, causing total economic damage of 1 billion USD in Copenhagen (Denmark) in 2011 (Wójcik et al., 2013), damage to private households of more than 70 million EUR in Münster (Germany) in 2014 (Spekkers et al., 2017) and during the 2021 floods in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands over 200 deaths, damage to thousands of homes and disrupted water and electricity supply (Kreienkamp et al., 2021). The intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall events is projected to increase (high confidence) (Figure 13.3; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). Combined with increasing urbanisation, the risk of pluvial flooding is projected to increase (Westra et al., 2014; Rosenzweig et al., 2018; Papalexiou and Montanari, 2019). Small catchments, steep river channels and cities are particularly vulnerable due to large areas of impermeable surfaces where water cannot penetrate (Section 13.6).
