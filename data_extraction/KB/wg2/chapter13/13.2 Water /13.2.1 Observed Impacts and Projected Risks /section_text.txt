Water temperatures in rivers and lakes have increased over the past century by ~1–3°C in major European rivers (CBS, 2014; EEA, 2017a; Woolway et al., 2017). Warming is accelerating for all European river basins (Wanders et al., 2019) increasing by 0.8°C in response to 1.5°C GWL and 1.2°C for 3°C GWL relative to 1971–2000 (van Vliet et al., 2016a) aggravated by declines in summer river flow.(Ground)water extractions or drainage have caused saltwater intrusions (Rasmussen et al., 2013; Ketabchi et al., 2016). During summer, seawater will also penetrate estuaries further upstream in response to reduced river flow and SLR, resulting in more frequent closure of water inlets in the downstream part of the rivers in a period when water is most needed (high agreement, low evidence) (e.g., Haasnoot et al., 2020b).
