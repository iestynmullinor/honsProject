An assessment of the full solution space of adaptation options and pathways under low to high GWL, including the long term, is lacking. A quantification of the effectiveness of measures in reducing risk is limited in the scientific literature. The available assessments consider adaptation by incremental measures. Transformative options, such as land-use changes, planned relocation from exposed areas or restricting future development, are rarely considered. While high-end scenarios describing low confidence processes and scenarios beyond 2100 are considered to be useful for risk-averse decision making, in particular coastal adaptation (Hinkel et al., 2019; Haasnoot et al., 2020b), they are rarely considered in practice.
