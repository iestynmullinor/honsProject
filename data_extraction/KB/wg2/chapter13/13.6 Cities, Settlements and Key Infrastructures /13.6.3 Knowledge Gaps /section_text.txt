A key knowledge gap is the lack of a quantitative European-wide integrated assessment of future climate-change risks on water and energy, including different socioeconomic futures. Models capable of representing integrated policies for energy and water are lacking (Khan et al., 2016) including quantitative modelling of impacts on energy transmission and coastal energy infrastructure (Cronin et al., 2018). These lacks are especially pertinent when combined with the small number of studies considering SSP population projections and adaptation tipping points. The limited social vulnerability assessments, mapping and validation (Rufat et al., 2019) contribute further to these knowledge gaps.While compound, concurrent and consecutive climate extremes become more frequent, there is limited knowledge on sectoral risks or on cascading risks for through transport, telecommunications, water, and banking and finance. While heat is well studied, studies on risks for cities and key infrastructures from hailstorms and lightning are missing.Empirical data on the damage of transport infrastructure (e.g., railways) covering different European countries have not been systematically collected, and indirect economic effects of interruptions of transport networks have not been well studied (Bubeck et al., 2019). These deficits result in uncertainties associated with impacts of climate change on transport flows and indirect impacts (e.g., delays, economic losses).There is limited knowledge on interactions created by synchronous adaptation in ski tourism supply and demand, and models do not yet include individual snowmaking capacity and a higher time resolution (Steiger et al., 2019). Furthermore, there is no European-wide assessment of coastal flooding risks on tourism.Many studies lack consideration of market characteristics (e.g., competitors) in their risk assessment, which would be improved by location- and sector-specific knowledge on climate risks for firm assets, operations, business, industry, finance and insurance needed to inform adaptation actions (de Bruin et al., 2020; Feridun and Güngör, 2020; Monasterolo, 2020).
