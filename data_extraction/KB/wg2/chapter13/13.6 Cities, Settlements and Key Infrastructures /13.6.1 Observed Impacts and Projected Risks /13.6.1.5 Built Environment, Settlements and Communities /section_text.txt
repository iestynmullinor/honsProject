Increasing temperatures in NEU and the Alps has led to accelerated degradation of permafrost, negatively affecting the stability of infrastructures (Stoffel et al., 2014; Beniston et al., 2018; Duvillard et al., 2019). In the Caucasus, glacial mudflows due to permafrost degradation and modern tectonic processes pose a significant danger to the infrastructure (Vaskov, 2016). In the past 30 years, the permafrost temperature in the European part of the Russian Arctic has increased by 0.5–2°C, resulting in damage to buildings, roads and pipelines, and to significant expenditure for stabilising soils (Porfiriev et al., 2017; Konnova and Lvova, 2019). Beyond 3°C GWL, the bearing capacity for infrastructure in the permafrost region of the European Russia could decrease by 32–75% by mid-century and by 95% by 2100, potentially affecting settlements in northern EEU (Shiklomanov et al., 2017; Streletskiy et al., 2019). The increasing number of cycles of freezing and thawing, observed in EEU, has led to accelerated ageing of building envelopes (Section 13.8.1.4; Frolov et al., 2014). Permafrost degradation due to higher temperatures could increase the potential of debris flow detachment in Alpine locations (Section 13.6.1.4; Damm and Felderer, 2013). Increased precipitation falling on local topography can increase landslide and mudflow risks, as seen in settlements at the Caucasus mountainous region (Marchenko et al., 2017; Efremov and Shulyakov, 2018; Kerimov et al., 2020). At the Umbria region in Italy, landslide events could increase by 16–53% under 2°C GWL and by 24–107% beyond 3°C GWL, mostly during winter (Ciabatta et al., 2016). Risks from shallow landslides are expected to increase in the Alps and Carpathians if no adequate risk mitigation measures are put in place (CCP5.3.2; Gariano and Guzzetti, 2016).
