New studies increase confidence in AR5 statements that flood damages will increase in coastal areas due to SLR and changing social and economic conditions (Section 13.2.1.1). Except for areas affected by land uplift, it is projected that further adaptation will be required to maintain risks at the present level for most coastal cities and settlements (Haasnoot et al., 2013; Ranger et al., 2013; Malinin et al., 2018; Hinkel et al., 2019; Umgiesser, 2020).In many cities, the sewer system is older than 40 years, potentially reducing their capacity to deal with more intense pluvial flooding (EEA, 2020b). Apart from climate change, urbanisation is an important driver for increases in flooding risks as it results in growth of impervious surfaces. Flash floods are particularly challenging, causing the overburdening of drainage systems (Dale et al., 2018), urban transport disruptions, and health and pollution impacts due to untreated sewage discharges (Kourtis and Tsihrintzis, 2021).More than 25% of the population in nearly 13% of EU cities live within potential river floodplains. In many of these places (e.g., 50% of UK cities), a significant increase in the 10-year high river flow is possible beyond 2Â°C GWL under a high-impact scenario (i.e., 90th percentile of projections) (Guerreiro et al., 2018; EEA, 2020b).
