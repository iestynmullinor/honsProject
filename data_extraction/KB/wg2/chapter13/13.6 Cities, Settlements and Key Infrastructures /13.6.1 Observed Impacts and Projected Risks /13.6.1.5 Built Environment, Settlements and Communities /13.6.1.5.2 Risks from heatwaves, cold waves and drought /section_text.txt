Heatwave days and number of long heatwaves increased in most capitals from 1998–2015 compared with 1980–1997 (Morabito et al., 2017; Seneviratne et al., 2021). In the summer of 2018, many cities suffered from heatwaves attributed to climate change (Vogel et al., 2019; Undorf et al., 2020). As a result, indoor overheating and reduced outdoor thermal comfort, often coupled with urban heat island (UHI) effect, have already impacted European cities (see also Section 13.7.1; Di Napoli et al., 2018; EEA, 2020b).Heatwaves are likely  to become a major threat, not only for SEU but also for WCE and EEU cities (Russo et al., 2015; Guerreiro et al., 2018; Lorencova et al., 2018; Smid et al., 2019). At 2°C GWL and SSP3, half of the European population will be under very high risk of heat stress in summer (Rohat et al., 2019). The UHI effect will further increase urban temperatures (Estrada et al., 2017). In many cities, hospitals and social housing tend to be located within the intense UHI, thus increasing exposure to vulnerable groups (EEA, 2020b). There is high confidence that overheating during summer in buildings with insufficient ventilation and/or solar protection will increase strongly, with thermal comfort hours potentially decreasing by 74% in SEU at 3°C GWL (Jenkins et al., 2014a; Hamdy et al., 2017; Heracleous and Michael, 2018; Dino and Meral Akgül, 2019; Shen et al., 2020). Highly insulated buildings, following present building standards, will be vulnerable to overheating, particularly under high GWL levels, unless adequate adaptation measures are applied (Williams et al., 2013; Virk et al., 2014; Mulville and Stravoravdis, 2016; Fosas et al., 2018; Ibrahim and Pelsmakers, 2018; Salem et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020). Cities in NEU and WCE are more vulnerable due to limited solar shading and fewer air conditioning installations (Ward et al., 2016; Thomson et al., 2019). Cooling energy demand in SEU buildings has been projected to increase by 81–104% by 2035 and 91–244% after 2065 compared with 1961–1990 depending on GWL (Cellura et al., 2018). Increases of 31–73% by 2050 and 165–323% by 2100 compared with 1996–2005 were estimated for buildings in NEU (Dodoo and Gustavsson, 2016) with risks modified by adaptation (Section 13.6.2; Viguié et al., 2020). Cold waves beyond 3°C GWL will not represent an effective threat for European cities at the end of the century, and only a marginal hazard under 2°C GWL (Smid et al., 2019).At 2°C GWL and beyond, cities in SEU and large parts of WCE would exceed the historical maximum 12-month Drought Severity index of the past 50 years (see Section 13.2 on drought risks) and 30% will have at least 30% probability of exceeding this maximum every month (Guerreiro et al., 2018). This could adversely affect the operation of municipal water services (Kingsborough et al., 2016). For example, under 2°C GWL, the reservoir storage volume is predicted to decrease for all of England and Wales catchments, resulting in a probability of years with water-use restrictions doubling by 2050 and quadrupling by 2100 compared with 1975–2004 (Dobson et al., 2020). The combination of high temperatures, drought and extreme winds, potentially coupled with insufficient preparedness and adaptation, may amplify the damage of wildfires in peri-urban environments (Section 13.3.1.3). High fuel load combined with proximity of the built environment to wildland highly increases fire risks (EEA, 2020b).Extreme heat and drought causes shrinking and swelling of clays, threatening the stability of small houses in peri-urban environments (Pritchard et al., 2015), with damage costs of 0.9–1 billion EUR during the 2003 heatwave (Corti et al., 2011). In WCE and SEU, mean annual damage costs could increase by 50% for 2°C GWL, and by a factor of 2 for 3°C GWL (Naumann et al., 2021).
