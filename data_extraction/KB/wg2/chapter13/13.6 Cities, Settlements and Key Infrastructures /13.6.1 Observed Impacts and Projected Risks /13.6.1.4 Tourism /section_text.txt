Snow-cover duration and snow depth in the Alps has decreased since the 1960s (Klein et al., 2016; Schöner et al., 2019; Matiu et al., 2021). Despite snowmaking, the number of skiers to French resorts at low elevations during the extraordinary warm and dry winters of 2006–2007 and 2010–2011 was 12–26% lower (Falk and Vanat, 2016).Due to reduced snow availability and hotter summers, damages are projected for the European tourism industry, with larger losses in SEU (high confidence) and some smaller gains in the rest of Europe (medium confidence) (Ciscar Martinez et al., 2014; Roson and Sartori, 2016; Dellink et al., 2019).At 2°C GWL, the operation of low-altitude resorts without snowmaking will likely  be discontinued, while beyond 3°C GWL, snowmaking will be necessary, but not always sufficient, for most resorts in many European mountains and parts of NEU (Pons et al., 2015; Joly and Ungureanu, 2018; Scott et al., 2019; Spandre et al., 2019). Expanding snowmaking is capital intensive and will strongly increase water and energy consumption, particularly at 3°C GWL and beyond (Spandre et al., 2019; Morin et al., 2021), adversely affecting the financial stability of small resorts (Pons et al., 2015; Falk and Vanat, 2016; Spandre et al., 2016; Joly and Ungureanu, 2018; Moreno-Gené et al., 2018; Steiger and Scott, 2020). Permafrost degradation due to rising temperatures is expected to create stability risks for ropeway transport infrastructure at high-altitude Alpine areas (Duvillard et al., 2019).Climatic conditions from May to October at 1.5–2°C GWL are projected to become more favourable for summer tourism in NEU and parts of WCE and EEU, while there is medium confidence on opposite trends for SEU from June to August (Grillakis et al., 2016; Scott et al., 2016; Jacob et al., 2018; Koutroulis et al., 2018). The amenity of European beaches may decrease as a result of SLR amplifying coastal erosion and inundation risks, although less in NEU (Section 13.2; Ebert et al., 2016; Toimil et al., 2018; Lopez-Doriga et al., 2019; Ranasinghe et al., 2021).
