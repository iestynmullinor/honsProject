Urban adaptation plans can enhance resilience, and their development is mandatory in the UK, France and Denmark (Reckien et al., 2019). There is medium confidence that the development of urban adaptation planning is much more influenced by a city’s population size, present adaptive capacity and GDP per capita than by anticipated climate risks (Reckien et al., 2018). A high organisational capacity in a municipality may not be a necessary condition for forward-looking investment decisions on urban water infrastructure, although enablers differ for small versus medium-to-large municipalities (Pot et al., 2019). There is large in-country variation in policy mixes utilised by local governments for supporting adaptation (Lesnikowski et al., 2019). In early-adapter cities (e.g., Rotterdam), adaptation is institutionally embedded in climate, resilience and sustainability-related actions, as well as collaboration between city departments, government levels, businesses and other stakeholders (Holscher et al., 2019). In most other cities, however, adaptation planners rarely consider collaborations with citizens, and there are difficulties in departmental coordination and upscaling from pilot projects (Brink and Wamsler, 2018).The level and type of collaboration between the public and private sectors in managing climate risks varies across Europe (Wiering et al., 2017; Alkhani, 2020). For example, in flood management (Section 13.2), the private-sector involvement in Rotterdam is much more pronounced and there are joint public–private responsibilities throughout most of the policy process due to the large share of private ownership of land and real estate (Mees et al., 2014).In large infrastructure networks, the lack of a leading and powerful institutional body, with sufficient research resources targeted to climate-change risk assessment, may limit adaptive capacity, as for example in railways (Rotter et al., 2016).The European insurance industry has developed tailored products for specific climate risks threatening cities, settlements and key infrastructures, such as risk-based flood insurance for homeowners and companies (Section 13.2.3). The European insurance industry is developing new services (such as risk analysis and catastrophe modelling embedding climate change, early warning and post-event recovery recommendations), and it has recently started to play a role as communicator of future risks and as institutional investor with the aim of risk reduction (Jones and Phillips, 2016; Marchal et al., 2019).
