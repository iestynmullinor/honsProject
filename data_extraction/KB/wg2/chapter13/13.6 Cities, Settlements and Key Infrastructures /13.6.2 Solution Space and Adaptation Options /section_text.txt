Evidence from transport in Europe shows that adaptation actions do not consider enough long-term transition paths embedded in mitigation, while mitigation strategies are often not assessed under future climate scenarios (Aparicio, 2017). Without rapid decarbonisation of electricity supply, greenhouse gas emissions will increase due to the increased use of air conditioning installations in cities. This trade-off can be reduced to some extent through use of more efficient cooling technologies (IEA, 2018) and complementary adaptation measures such as large-scale urban greening, building policies and behavioural changes in air conditioning use (Viguié et al., 2020; Sharifi, 2021; Viguié et al., 2021). Greenhouse gas emissions from transport may increase due to the temporary relocation of city residents to cooler locations during heatwaves (Juschten et al., 2019), and from increased energy use for snowmaking in European ski resorts (Scott et al., 2019).
