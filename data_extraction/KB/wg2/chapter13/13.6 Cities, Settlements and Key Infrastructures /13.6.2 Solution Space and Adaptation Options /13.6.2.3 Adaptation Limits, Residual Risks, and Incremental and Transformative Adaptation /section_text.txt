Adaptation in cities, settlements and key infrastructures in Europe faces technical, environmental, economic and social limits (Figure 13.21).Figure 13.21 | Indicative adaptation limits in cities, settlements and key infrastructures in Europe (Table SM13.16)  Open figure Adaptation options for many sectors will not be sufficient to remove residual risks, for example, regarding (a) overheating in buildings under high GWL (Tillson et al., 2013; Virk et al., 2014; Dodoo and Gustavsson, 2016; Mulville and Stravoravdis, 2016; Hamdy et al., 2017; Heracleous and Michael, 2018; Dino and Meral Akgül, 2019); (b) snowmaking beyond 3°C GWL (Scott et al., 2019; Steiger and Scott, 2020; Steiger et al., 2020); (c) hydropower (Gaudard et al., 2013; Ranzani et al., 2018); (d) electricity transmission and demand (Bollinger and Dijkema, 2016; EEA, 2019a; Palkowski et al., 2019); (e) urban subways (Jenkins et al., 2014a); and (f) flood mitigation in cities (Skougaard Kaspersen et al., 2017; Umgiesser, 2020). Some adaptation actions in a sector may also have side effects on others, increasing their vulnerability (Sections 13.2.2, 13.2.3; Pranzini et al., 2015).Examples of transformative adaptation in urban areas have been observed (e.g., the Benthemplein water square, the Floating Pavilion in Rotterdam and the Hafencity flood proofing in Hamburg), but they often remain policy experiments and prove challenging to upscale (Jacob, 2015; Restemeyer et al., 2015; Restemeyer et al., 2018; Holscher et al., 2019). Active involvement of local stakeholders, public administration and political leaders are drivers for community transformation, whereas lack of local resources and/or capacities are frequently reported barriers to change (Fünfgeld et al., 2019; Thaler et al., 2019).
