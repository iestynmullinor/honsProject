Within the private sector, there tends to be a preference for ‘soft’ (e.g., knowledge generation) than ‘hard’ (e.g., infrastructure) adaptation measures (Goldstein et al., 2019), in contrast to government-led responses typically favouring hard measures (Pranzini et al., 2015). However, there also remains diversity across sectors and organisations in the degree and type of adaptation response (Trawöger, 2014; Dannevig and Hovelsrud, 2016; Ray et al., 2017; Ricart et al., 2019). Whereas some sectors, such as flood management, banking and insurance, and energy (Bank of England, 2015; Gasbarro and Pinkse, 2016; Bank of England, 2019; Botzen et al., 2019), have generally made moderate progress on adaptation planning across Europe, there are key vulnerable economic sectors that are in earlier stages, including aviation (Burbidge, 2018), ports and shipping (Becker et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2018), and ICT (high confidence) (EEA, 2018b). There is also some evidence of ‘short-sighted’ adaptation or maladaptation; for example, in winter tourism there is a preference for technical and reactive solutions (e.g., artificial snow) that will not be sufficient under high levels of warming (Section 13.6.1.4).Where adaptation is considered by companies, it is typically triggered either by the experience of extreme weather events that led to business disruptions (McKnight and Linnenluecke, 2019) or is included into corporate risk management in response to regulatory, shareholder or customer pressure (Averchenkova et al., 2016; Gasbarro et al., 2017). For instance, following the implementation of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure by the European Commission in 2019, 50 publicly listed companies revealed their exposure to their physical climate risks in 2020 (CDSB, 2020). But even if companies experience extreme weather events or stakeholder pressure, they may not adapt because they underestimate their vulnerability (Table 13.1; Pinkse and Gasbarro, 2019). For example, key barriers to adaptation among Greek firms include both external (e.g., lack of support and/or guidance) and internal factors (e.g., few resources, managerial perceptions) (Halkos et al., 2018). Lack of knowledge, feeling climate change is not a salient risk, and lack of social learning or collaboration appear to be key barriers to private-sector adaptation (Section 13.1 6.2.2; Dinca et al., 2014; André et al., 2017; Romagosa and Pons, 2017; Esteve et al., 2018; Luís et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2018). There remains little research on private-sector awareness of, or responses to, cascading or compound risks associated with climate change (Miller and Pescaroli, 2018 ; Pescaroli, 2018).
