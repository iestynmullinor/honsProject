Coordinated responses are necessary to prevent inefficient and costly action (Biesbroek, 2021), balance under- and overreaction to climate risks (Peters et al., 2017; Biesbroek and Candel, 2019), prevent redistributing vulnerability and maladaptive actions (Atteridge and Remling, 2018 ; Albizua et al., 2019; Neset et al., 2019), and ensure timely implementation (high confidence) (Benson and Lorenzoni, 2017). Since AR5, progress has been made to increase coordinated adaptation actions, but so far this is limited to a few sectors (mostly water management and agriculture) and European countries and regions (mostly SEU, and WCE depending on impact) (high confidence) (Section 13.11.2; Lesnikowski et al., 2016; Biesbroek and Delaney, 2020; Booth et al., 2020). Despite evidence of emerging bottom-up (e.g., citizens and business) and top-down initiatives (e.g., governmental plans and instruments to ensure action), there are considerable barriers to mainstreaming adaptation (high confidence) (Runhaar et al., 2018).While mainstreaming of adaptation into other policy domains has been advocated as an enabler for adaptation, it may have resulted in incremental rather than transformational adaptation, and may not be sufficient to close the adaptation gap (Andersson and Keskitalo, 2018; Remling, 2018; Scoville-Simonds et al., 2020).
