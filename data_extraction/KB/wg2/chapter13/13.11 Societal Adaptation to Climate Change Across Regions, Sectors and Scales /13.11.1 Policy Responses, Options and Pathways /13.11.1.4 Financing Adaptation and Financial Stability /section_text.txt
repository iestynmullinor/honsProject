Dedicated financial resources for the implementation of NAS and plans are a key enabling factor for successful adaptation (high confidence) (Chapter 17; Russel et al., 2020). Yet, only 14 EU countries have announced such budget allocations in their plans and strategies; and even if budget numbers are available, they are difficult to compare (EEA, 2020a). Current adaptation spending varies greatly across and within European countries, partly reflecting (sub)national adaptation priorities or financing sources targeting investment projects (López-Dóriga et al., 2020; Russel et al., 2020) and competing statutory priorities (Porter et al., 2015). European government budgets are also burdened by climate-change damages today, particularly after huge flooding events, and austerity following financial crises, limiting anticipatory action (Penning-Rowsell and Priest, 2015; Miskic et al., 2017; Schinko et al., 2017; Slavíková et al., 2020). National adaptation funding in EU member states is complemented by EU funding (e.g., European Structural and Investment Funds, European Regional Development Funds, and LIFE program). While the EU spending target on climate action increased from 20% in 2016–2020 to 25% in 2021–2026, most spending is going into mitigation, not adaptation (Berkhout et al., 2015; Hanger et al., 2015; EEA, 2020a).With higher warming levels, financing needs are likely  to increase (high confidence) (Mochizuki et al., 2018; Bachner et al., 2019; Parrado et al., 2020), and governments can address this higher need by cutting other expenditures, increasing taxes or by increasing the fiscal deficit (Miskic et al., 2017; Mochizuki et al., 2018; Bachner et al., 2019). Yet, the requirement for fiscal consolidation that will be needed after the COVID-19 pandemic (Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7) may also lead to a cessation of adaptation spending, as evidenced by the expenditure drop in coastal protection in Spain after the financial crisis in 2008 (López-Dóriga et al., 2020). Governments can shift the financial burden to beneficiaries of adaptation, as suggested, for example, for coastal protection and riverine flooding (Jongman et al., 2014; Penning-Rowsell and Priest, 2015; Bisaro and Hinkel, 2018). There is also an increase in financial mechanisms to accelerate private adaptation actions, including adaptation loans, subsidies, direct investments and novel public–private arrangements. For example, the European Investment Bank created a finance facility to support European regions through loans to implement adaptation projects (EEA, 2020a).Since AR5, new evidence has emerged that climate change may deteriorate financial stability both at the global and European scales (Campiglio et al., 2018; Dafermos et al., 2018; Lamperti et al., 2019; ECB, 2021a). The European Central Bank, the European Systemic Risk Board, and several national central banks in NEU and WCE have started to systematically assess the consequences of climate risks for financial stability and plan to integrate climate stress testing into their supervisory tools (Batten et al., 2016; ECB, 2021a; ECB, 2021b).
