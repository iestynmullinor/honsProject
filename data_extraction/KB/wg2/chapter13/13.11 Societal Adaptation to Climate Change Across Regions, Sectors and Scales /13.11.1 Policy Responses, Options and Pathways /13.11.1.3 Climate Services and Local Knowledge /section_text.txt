Climate services to support adaptation decision making of governments and businesses across Europe have rapidly increased since AR5, partly as a result of national and EU investments such as the Copernicus C3S service (high confidence) (Street, 2016; Soares and Buontempo, 2019). These services are increasingly used in NEU, SEU and WCE, for example, in energy and risk prevention in coastal and riverine cities, stimulating regulations and bottom-up initiatives (Cavelier et al., 2017; Le Cozannet et al., 2017; Reckien et al., 2018; Howard et al., 2020). However, climate service efficacy is rarely systematically evaluated (Cortekar et al., 2020). Barriers to use include: lack of perceived usefulness of climate information to organisations and expertise to use the information, outdated statistics, mismatch between needs and type of information made available, insufficient effective engagement between providers and recipients of climate information and lack of business models to sustain climate services over time (high evidence, medium agreement ) (Cavelier et al., 2017; Räsänen et al., 2017; Bruno Soares et al., 2018; Christel et al., 2018; Oberlack and Eisenack, 2018; Hewitt et al., 2020). Adaptation-decision support platforms also face challenges regarding updating, training and engagement with users (EEA, 2015; Palutikof et al., 2019).In addition to scientific knowledge, traditional and local knowledge can enable adaptation action (Huntington et al., 2017) as is the case with indigenous-led ecosystem restoration in the European Arctic (Brattland and Mustonen, 2018 ). There is a need to draw on surviving Indigenous knowledge systems in Europe (Greenland, Nenets, Khanty, Sámi, Veps, Ingrian) as unique, endemic ways of knowing the world that can position present and historical change in context and offer unique reflections of change in the future (Ogar et al., 2020; Mustonen et al., 2021).
