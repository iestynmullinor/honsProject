With a 2019 total population of over 494 million people (USA 329 million, Mexico 128 million and Canada 37 million), North America comprises 6.4% of the global population. Relative to other countries, North American countries have low population densities per square kilometre (Mexico 64 people, USA 35 people and Canada 4 people) (United Nations, 2019). Population projections indicate a steady growth in the three countries, which will exert pressure on consumption and increase risks under climate change (United Nations, 2019). North America is also responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Since 1990, North American GHG emissions have increased by almost 18% (Ritchie and Roser, 2020), and in 2019 the region was responsible for 5.9 MtCO2 emissions worldwide (Friedlingstein et al., 2020). In terms of annual CO2 emissions per capita, in 2019 Canada had 15 metric tons of CO2 per person (tCO2 per person), the USA had 16 tCO2 per person and Mexico had 3.4 tCO2 per person (Friedlingstein et al., 2020).
