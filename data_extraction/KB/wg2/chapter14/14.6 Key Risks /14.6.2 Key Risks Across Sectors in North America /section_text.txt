In major North American cities and settlements, vulnerability to climate change has increased and is projected to continue to rise (medium confidence) (Section 14.5.5). Concentrated populations with unequal adaptive capacities, exposure of valuable assets, ageing infrastructure, and differing degrees of institutional capacity and effectiveness will underpin climate hazards (Section 14.5.5). Coastal, riverine and urban flooding displacing communities and coastal ecosystems (Section 14.5.5.2) will become a dominant risk to urban centres (high confidence) and will cause disruptions to transportation and trade infrastructure (Section 14.5.8). Large wildfires endangering lives, livelihoods, property and key infrastructure, and economic activities will contribute to compromised air quality and municipal water contamination (Section 14.5.6; see Box 14.2).
