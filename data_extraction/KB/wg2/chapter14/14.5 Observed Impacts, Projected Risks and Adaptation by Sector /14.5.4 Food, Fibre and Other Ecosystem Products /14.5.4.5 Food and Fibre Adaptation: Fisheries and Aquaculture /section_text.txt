Proactive and ecosystem-based management increases climate resilience in fisheries (high confidence), but effectiveness after 2050 may be limited without global carbon mitigation (medium confidence) (Gaichas et al., 2017; Gaines et al., 2018; Kritzer et al., 2019; Barbeaux et al., 2020; Free et al., 2020; Holsman et al., 2020). Flexibility (e.g., mobility, diverse incomes or harvest portfolios) underpins climate resilience across regions, management policies and fisheries, although small-scale fisheries have less scope for adaptation (Aguilera et al., 2015; Young et al., 2019). Climate-informed and dynamic management (Hazen et al., 2018) improves modelled fishery performance (medium confidence) (Section 14.5.2; Froehlich et al., 2017; Tommasi et al., 2017a; Tommasi et al., 2017b; Karp et al., 2019; Barbeaux et al., 2020), yet planning and policies that directly incorporate climate-change information remain limited (Skern-Mauritzen et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2019b). Expanding aquaculture across North America will likely  address deficits in nutritional and protein yields (Gentry et al., 2019; Costello et al., 2020), yet aquaculture initiatives have largely progressed without explicitly considering climate impacts (FAO, 2018; Froehlich et al., 2019), and critical elements for climate adaptation (e.g., climate-informed zoning, monitoring, insurance) are not widely implemented (Liñan-Cabello et al., 2016; FAO, 2018; Stewart-Sinclair et al., 2020). Climate-informed and standardised aquaculture governance, and increased coordination with fishery and coastal management, is needed for climate resilience (high confidence) (Brugère et al., 2019; Froehlich et al., 2019; Free et al., 2020; Galparsoro et al., 2020).
