Climate impacts outlined in Section 14.5.2 have induced yield losses for multiple subsistence, recreational and commercial fisheries (very high confidence), and contributed to commercial fishery closures across North America (Sections 14.5.1, 14.5.3; Figure 14.6; Table SM14.7; Lynn et al., 2014; Barbeaux et al., 2020; Fisher et al., 2021). Climate-driven declines in productivity are widespread (high confidence) (Figure 14.6), although a few increases are observed in northern regions (medium confidence) (Cunningham et al., 2018; Crozier et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019b). Redistribution of species has increased travel distance to fishing grounds, shifted stocks across regulatory and international boundaries, and increased interactions with protected species (very high confidence) (Figure 14.6; Table SM14.7; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE in Chapter 5; Morley et al., 2018; Free et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019b; Rogers et al., 2019; Stevenson and Lauth, 2019; Young et al., 2019). Climate shocks have reduced yield and increased instability in fishery revenue (high confidence) (Fisher et al., 2021).Figure 14.6 | Case studies of climate-change impacts on North American fisheries (blue text) and aquaculture (gray text). Open figure Declines in yield and poleward stock redistributions (an average of ~20.6 km per decade) are expected to continue under climate change and increase in magnitude with atmospheric carbon (high confidence) (Table 14.4; Hare et al., 2016; Pecl et al., 2017; Rheuban et al., 2017; Morley et al., 2018; Smale et al., 2019; Szuwalski et al., 2021). For example, without adaptation, end-of-century losses of Bering Sea pollock yield (relative to persistence scenarios) is likely  to reach 50% under moderate (RCP4.5) and 80% under low (RCP8.5) mitigation scenarios, respectively (Holsman et al., 2020). Expanding HABs, pathogens and altered ocean chemistry (OA and dissolved oxygen) will reduce yields and increase closures of fisheries along all North American coasts (medium confidence) (Section 14.5.2; Deutsch et al., 2015a; Ekstrom et al., 2015; Seung et al., 2015; Punt et al., 2016; Howard et al., 2020). For fisheries that represent 56% of current US fishing revenue, projected annual net losses under high-emission scenarios (RCP8.5, 2021â€“2100) may reach double that of low-emission scenarios (RCP2.6) (Moore et al., 2021).Warming waters and OA have impacted aquaculture production in North America (high confidence) (Figure 14.6; Clements and Chopin, 2017; Reid et al., 2019; Stewart-Sinclair et al., 2020). Under climate change (RCP8.5), declines in marine finfish and bivalve aquaculture become likely  by mid-century (Froehlich et al., 2018; Stewart-Sinclair et al., 2020). Adaptation is possible but uncertain (Bitter et al., 2019; Fitzer et al., 2019; Reid et al., 2019), especially with increasing extreme events. Nature-based aquaculture solutions (e.g., conservation aquaculture, restorative aquaculture) could aid carbon mitigation and local-level adaptation, especially for seaweed and bivalve culture (see Box 14.7; Froehlich et al., 2017; Froehlich et al., 2019; Reid et al., 2019; Theuerkauf et al., 2019).
