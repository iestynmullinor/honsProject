Land management and horticulture approaches that preserve and improve soil structure and organic matter can reduce erosion (high confidence) (Sections 14.5.1, 14.5.3; Lal et al., 2011; Bisbis et al., 2018). Preserving biodiversity and water, changing planting dates and double cropping are also effective climate adaptation strategies (Bisbis et al., 2018; Hernandez-Ochoa et al., 2018; Monterroso-Rivas et al., 2018; Wolfe et al., 2018). Traditional agriculture inherently includes climate adaptive practices that enhance biodiversity, soil quality and agricultural production (e.g., multiple cultivars, heat-tolerant heritage cattle breeds) (Bermeo et al., 2014; Gomez-Aiza et al., 2017; Ortiz-Colón et al., 2018). Agroecology and agroforestry (see Box 14.7) in North America has expanded from (but not replaced) traditional and rural practices in Mexico (Metcalfe et al., 2020a) as a sustainable and climate-resilient alternative to industrial agriculture (Schoeneberger et al., 2017) that increases productivity (by 6–65% depending on the crop), enhances microclimates and provides co-benefits for GHG mitigation (Abbas et al., 2017; Cardinael et al., 2017; Schoeneberger et al., 2017; Snapp et al., 2021). Irrigation is an effective adaptation strategy in key agricultural areas (Miller, 2017; Lund et al., 2018) and could stabilise food security in rain-fed regions (e.g., southeast Mexico) (Spring, 2014); water allocation must balance multiple needs and rights (medium confidence) (Section 14.5.3; Brown et al., 2015b; Levis et al., 2018; Gomez Diaz et al., 2019). Heritage livestock breeds, changing species and precision-ranching technology may promote ranch and rangeland resilience (Zhao et al., 2013). In loblolly pine plantations in the southern USA, effective adaptation includes reducing tree density and, less effectively, shifting to slash pine (Susaeta et al., 2014). Salvage logging following forest disturbances (e.g., insect outbreaks) can increase timber harvest (Bogdanski et al., 2011; USDA Forst Service, 2011; Han et al., 2018; Morris et al., 2018a).
