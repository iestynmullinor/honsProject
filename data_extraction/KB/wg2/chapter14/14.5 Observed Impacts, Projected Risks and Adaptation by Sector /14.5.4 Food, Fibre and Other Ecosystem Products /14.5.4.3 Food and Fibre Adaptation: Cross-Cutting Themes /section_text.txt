Across food and fibre systems, climate resilience is enhanced through diversifying income and harvest portfolios as well as increasing local biodiversity and functional redundancy (high confidence) (Messier et al., 2019; Rogers et al., 2019; Young et al., 2019; Aquilué et al., 2020; Fisher et al., 2021). Ecosystem-based practices and sustainable intensification (increasing yields while minimising resource demand and ecosystem impacts) (Cassman and Grassini, 2020; Rockström et al., 2021) will help the sector meet food production demands under climate change (medium confidence), but effectiveness generally declines and is less certain after 2050 in scenarios without carbon mitigation (high confidence) (Bermeo et al., 2014; Gaines et al., 2018; Costello et al., 2020; Free et al., 2020; Holsman et al., 2020). Across the sector, successful adaptation is underpinned by approaches that meaningfully consider the coupled social–ecological networks around food and fibre production and value IK (very high confidence) (see Box 14.1; FAO, 2018; Steele et al., 2018; Calliari et al., 2019). Integrated modelling, participatory planning and inclusive decision making promote effective and equitable adaptation responses (very high confidence) (Figure 14.7, Section 14.7) Toledo-Hernández et al., 2017; Eakin et al., 2018; Monterroso and Conde, 2018; Alexander et al., 2019; Hodgson and Halpern, 2019; Holsman et al., 2019; Samhouri et al., 2019; Barbeaux et al., 2020; Hollowed et al., 2020), while a paucity of high-resolution and locally tailored climate change information remains a barrier to adaptation (Ekstrom et al., 2015; Donatti et al., 2017; Young et al., 2019).Figure 14.7 | Adaptation in North American food sectors is shown, modified from Cottrell et al.
