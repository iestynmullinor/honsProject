Climate change has had, and will continue to have, negative impacts on mental health in North America (high confidence) (Figure 14.8). Climate change impacts mental health through multiple direct and indirect pathways stemming from extreme weather events, slower, cumulative events, and vicarious or anticipatory events (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013; Cunsolo Willox et al., 2014; Durkalec et al., 2015; Yusa et al., 2015; Schwartz et al., 2017; Trombley et al., 2017; Burke et al., 2018b; Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018; Dodd et al., 2018b; Hayes et al., 2018; Middleton et al., 2020b). Climate-change disruptions to infrastructure, underlying determinants of health and changing-place attachment are also stressors on mental health (Vida et al., 2012; Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013; Burke et al., 2018b; Obradovich et al., 2018).Figure 14.8 | Pathways through which climate change impacts mental health risk in North AmericaOpen figure In North America, climate change has been linked to strong emotional reactions; depression and generalised anxiety; ecological grief and loss; increased drug and alcohol usage, family stress and domestic violence; increased suicide and suicide ideation; and loss of cultural knowledge and place-based identities and connections (Cunsolo Willox et al., 2013; Durkalec et al., 2015; Harper et al., 2015; Fern√°ndez-Arteaga et al., 2016; Schwartz et al., 2017; Trombley et al., 2017; Burke et al., 2018b; Cunsolo and Ellis, 2018; Clayton, 2020; Dumont et al., 2020).Suicide is projected to increase in Mexico and the USA by 2050 due to rising temperatures (RCP8.5) (limited evidence) (Burke et al., 2018b). Literature on climate change and mental health in North America is increasing; however, few population-level quantitative studies exist, although they are increasing (e.g., Burke et al., 2018b; Kim et al., 2019; Dumont et al., 2020; Middleton et al., 2021).
