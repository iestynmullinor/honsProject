Agricultural productivity declines due to climate change (Section 14.5.4) are projected to lower caloric availability and increase the prevalence of underweight people and climate-related deaths in North America by 2050 (IMPAACT) (Springmann et al., 2016a; Springmann et al., 2016b; Springmann et al., 2018); however, this lower caloric availability could also reduce obesity, which could result in deaths avoided (Springmann et al., 2016a; Springmann et al., 2016b). The climate-related deaths per capita due to reduced fruit and vegetable consumption is projected to exceed the mortality due to reduced caloric intake in North America by 2050, particularly in Canada and the USA (Springmann et al., 2016a; Springmann et al., 2016b). These climate-change projections underscore the importance of focusing on nutritional security in North America, instead of only considering caloric intake.Shifting to a more sustainable diet can have adaptation and mitigation co-benefits while simultaneously improving health outcomes for North Americans. Transitioning to more plant-based diets is projected to reduce climate-related deaths in Canada, the USA and Mexico by 2050 (Springmann et al., 2016a; Springmann et al., 2016b), while simultaneously reducing food-related GHG emissions per capita in North America by 2050 (Springmann et al., 2018).Nutrition impacts will not be experienced uniformly within countries (Shannon et al., 2015; Zeuli et al., 2018). In Alaska and Canada, IK has documented how climate change has already impacted locally harvested foods and challenged nutrition security (CCP6; Lynn et al., 2013; Petrasek MacDonald et al., 2013; Harper et al., 2015; Hupp et al., 2015; Bunce et al., 2016). For First Nations coastal communities in western Canada, decreased access to traditionally harvested seafood is projected to reduce nutritional status by 2050 (RCP2.5, RCP8.5), with higher nutritional impacts for men and older adults (Marushka et al., 2019). Substitution of seafood with non-traditional foods (e.g., chicken, canned tuna) would not replace the projected nutrients lost (Marushka et al., 2019), challenging assumptions that market food substitutions could be effective adaptation strategies for Indigenous Peoples
