Smoke from intensified wildfire activity in North America is associated with respiratory distress (very high confidence), and persists long distances from the wildfire and beyond the initial high-exposure time (see Box 14.2; Hutchinson et al., 2018). Exposure to wildfire smoke increases hospital admissions (McLean et al., 2015; Alman et al., 2016; Reid et al., 2016; Yao et al., 2016; Rojas-Downing et al., 2017). Increased wildfire smoke from climate change is projected to result in more respiratory hospital admissions in the western USA by 2046â€“2051 (A1B) (Liu et al., 2016; Rojas-Downing et al., 2017).The magnitude of health risks varies by age (Le et al., 2014; Reid et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017a; Liu et al., 2017b), gender (Delfino et al., 2009; Rojas-Downing et al., 2017), socioeconomic conditions (Henderson et al., 2011; Rappold et al., 2012; Reid et al., 2016) and underlying medical conditions (Liu et al., 2015). The intersectionality of these subgroups plays an important role in health-related vulnerability to wildfire smoke. Among the elderly in the western USA, risks of respiratory admissions from wildfire smoke was significantly higher for African American women in lower-education counties (Liu et al., 2017b). For Indigenous Peoples, medical visits for respiratory distress, heart disease and headaches increased during a wildfire in California (Lee et al., 2009). In northern Canada, Indigenous livelihoods were disrupted during a wildfire, which negatively impacted mental, emotional and physical health (Dodd et al., 2018a; Howard et al., 2021).
