In the USA, construction workers comprise 6% of the total workforce but accounted for 36% of all occupational heat-related deaths from 1992 to 2016 (Dong et al., 2019). It is expected that total labour hours among outdoor construction workers will decrease by 0.53% (±0.01%) per degree Celsius based on existing warming trends (Hsiang et al., 2017; also see EPA, 2017). Risks are expected to be exacerbated as SLR and storm surge expands the risk zone for coastal flooding exposing more property to inundation and enhancing construction demand (see Box 14.4; Section 14.5.5.1.3; EPA, 2017). Meeting existing and projected demand for water in affected regions could also require building new desalination plants. For example, Texas has constructed over 44 desalination plants across the state because of a lack of freshwater to meet potable water demand and due to climate-driven droughts (Kloesel et al., 2018b). Other infrastructure damaged by floods and SLR will need to be reassessed and perhaps relocated away from the coast. Relocation requires availability of land that frequently does not exist within urban areas (Lithogow, 2019). Some US tribes and Indigenous groups in Canada lack the financial resources to build climate-resilient infrastructure, such as housing and sewage treatment facilities, to assure clean drinking water (Martínez et al., 2014; Salgado and Luisa Martinez, 2017; Lithgow et al., 2019).Permafrost thaw in northern North America will result in increased construction and reconstruction needs (medium confidence) related to direct damage to buildings, roads, airport runways and other critical infrastructure including decreased bearing capacities of building and pipeline foundations, damage to road surfaces, and deterioration of reservoirs and impoundments used for wastewater and mine tailings containment (Pendakur, 2017; Meredith et al., 2019). Ice roads have become less safe due to warming, pavement damage has increased related to seasonal thaw–freeze cycles and there have been interruptions in airport operations, water and sewage service, and school operations in the Canadian territories of Yukon and Nunavut (Canadian Western and Eastern Arctic, i.e., CA-WA and CA-EA in Figure 14.1) (Council of Canadian Academies, 2019). By the end of the century, the economic impact of projected reconstruction of Alaska’s public infrastructure due to climate change (mainly from permafrost thaw) is estimated to range from 4.2 billion USD (RCP4.5) to 5.5 billion USD (RCP8.5) (Melvin et al., 2017; Markon et al., 2018).
