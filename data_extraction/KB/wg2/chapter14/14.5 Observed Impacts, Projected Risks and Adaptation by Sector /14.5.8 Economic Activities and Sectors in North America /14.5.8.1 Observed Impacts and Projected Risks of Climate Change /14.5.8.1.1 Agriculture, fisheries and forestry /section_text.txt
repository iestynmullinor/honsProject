The wide range of observed and projected impacts of climate hazards on food and fibre in North America are documented in Section 14.5.4 (also see Chapter 5). Agriculture (US-NW: corn and soybeans), fisheries (cod and pollock) and forestry (Boreal Forest timber yield) are expected to experience substantial and widespread risks by 2Â°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels (medium to high confidence) (Figure 14.10). Economic models generally show economic losses in the agricultural sector across North America, especially at higher GWL (Section 14.5.4; EPA, 2017; Boyd and Markandya, 2021), although the effects in local economies, especially rural areas of the USA that are highly dependent on agriculture, will be substantial even at lower GWLs (Gowda et al., 2018). Full evaluations of climate risks for forestry and fisheries are presented in Sections 14.5.1 and 14.5.4 (also see Section 14.6), respectively.
