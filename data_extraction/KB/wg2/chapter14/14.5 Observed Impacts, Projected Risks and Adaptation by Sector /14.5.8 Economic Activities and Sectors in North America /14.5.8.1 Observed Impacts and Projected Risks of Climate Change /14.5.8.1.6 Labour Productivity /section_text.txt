Climate change is negatively affecting working conditions and labour productivity in North America (medium confidence) (Section 14.5.6.1; see Box 14.5). Working conditions in temperatures above a heat index of 85째F (29.4째C) are correlated with potentially hazardous health conditions (Tustin et al., 2018), and for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, labour productivity is estimated to be reduced by 0.11% for low-risk workers and 0.53% for high-risk workers (i.e., construction, mining, agriculture and manufacturing) (Hsiang et al., 2017). By mid-century (RCP8.5), temperature increase, changing water availability and SLR are projected to result in a 0.6% drop in labour productivity in auto, timber, textile and chemical manufacturing in the southeast and Texas regions (Kinniburgh et al., 2015; Hsiang et al., 2017). Labour productivity in the US automobile industry decreases by 8% for every six or more days of consecutive unusually hot weather (above 90째F/32.2째C) (Cachon et al., 2012). Thirty percent of California workers are employed in high-risk industries, such as agriculture, with exposure to high temperature leading to loss in productivity (Rogers et al., 2015). Under RCP8.5 increases in extreme temperatures, labour productivity in the USA is projected to decrease, costing 190 billion USD in lost wages by 2090 (EPA, 2017; Kjellstrom et al., 2019; also see Gubernot et al., 2014; Kiefer et al., 2016; Carter et al., 2018).
