Transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, rail, air, sea and pipelines, are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures, SLR, weather extremes, changing ice conditions, permafrost degradation and flooding (high confidence), resulting in damage, disruption to operations, unsafe conditions and supply chain impacts (see Box 14.5; Board and Council, 2008; Natural Resources Conservation Service; Andrey and Palko, 2017; Jacobs et al., 2018; Lemmen et al., 2021). In the Mexican states of Veracruz, Tabasco, San Luis Potosí, Chiapas and Oaxaca, 105,000 infrastructure sites, mostly major connecting roads, were found to be at risk of flooding from tropical storms (De la Peña et al. 2018). Low water levels in the Great Lakes has severely impacted US grain transport (Attavanich et al., 2013). High-intensity rain events destroyed 1000 km of roads and washed out hundreds of bridges and culverts in 2013 resulting in an estimated 6 billion CAD (considering the 2013 CAD value) in damages and recovery costs in Alberta, Canada (Palko and Lemmen, 2017). In 2019, the rail line from Winnipeg to Churchill Manitoba, which is the only ground transportation to the community and to Canada’s only deep-water Arctic port, was reopened after being closed for over 2 years due to the cumulative effects of flooding, permafrost degradation and political challenges (Lin et al., 2020). In the USA, the number of heat-related train delays has increased (Bruzek et al., 2013; Chinowsky et al., 2019) and, by the end of the century, may cause economic losses of 25–45 billion USD (RCP4.5) or 35–60 billion USD (RCP8.5) (Chinowsky et al., 2019). Sea ice reduction in the North American Arctic has led to a rapid increase in ship traffic (Huntington et al., 2015; Phillips, 2016; Pizzolato et al., 2016; Huntington et al., 2021b; Li et al., 2021) with cascading risks related to invasive species introduction, accident rates, black carbon emissions, underwater noise pollution for marine mammals and risks to subsistence harvesting activities in Indigenous communities (Ware et al., 2014; Council of Canadian Academies, 2016; Huntington, 2021; Verna et al., 2016; Chan et al., 2019).
