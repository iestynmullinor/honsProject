Twelve million Americans (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015), 1.5 million Canadians (Statistics Canada, 2020) and 9 million Mexicans (Statistics Mexico, 2021) are employed in manufacturing. The southeast USA and Texas have the highest manufacturing output, with 34% of total US output (700 billion USD yr â€“1). The impact of climate change on manufacturing varies greatly by region. Vulnerability of the sector to climate change stems from exposure of workers to increasing temperatures and humidity, exposure of facilities to SLR and flooding, and changes in water supply and quality required in many manufacturing processes (Lall et al., 2018).
