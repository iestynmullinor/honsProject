Evidence continues to mount about the impacts of recent climate change on species and ecosystems (very high confidence) (Table 14.2; Weiskopf et al., 2020). Ranges and abundances of species continue to shift in response to warming throughout North America (very high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE in Chapter 5; Cavanaugh et al., 2014; Molina-Martínez et al., 2016; Tape et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2017; Pecl et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018a). Future climate change will continue to affect species and ecosystems (high confidence) (IPBES, 2018), with differential responses related to species characteristics and ecology (D’Orangeville et al., 2016; Weiskopf et al., 2019). Climate change is projected to adversely affect the range, migration and habitat of caribou, an important food and cultural resource in the Arctic (CCP6; Leblond et al., 2016; Masood et al., 2017; Barber et al., 2018b; Borish, 2022).Table 14.2 | Examples of observed climate-change impacts on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystemsImpactReferencesLocal extinctionsPomara et al.

(2020)Increases in harmful freshwater algal bloomsSee Section 14.5.3Climate-induced shifts in the timing of biological events (phenology) continue to be a well-documented ecological response (very high confidence) (Table 14.2; Vose et al., 2017; Lipton et al., 2018; Vose et al., 2018; Molnar et al., 2021). Reduced snow season length may potentially lead to adverse camouflage effects on animals that change coat colour (Mills et al., 2013; Mills et al., 2018). Human conflicts with bears are expected to increase in response to shifts in hibernation patterns (Johnson et al., 2018) and food resources (Wilder et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2017).Severe ecosystem consequences of warming and drying are well documented (very high confidence) (Table 14.2). Significant ecosystem changes are expected from projected climate change (high confidence), such as in Mexican cloud forests (Helmer et al., 2019), North American rangelands (Polley et al., 2013; Reeves et al., 2014) and montane forests (Stewart et al., 2021; Wright et al., 2021). Permafrost thaw is projected to increase in Alaska and Canada (DeBeer et al., 2016; see also Ranasinghe et al., 2021), accelerating carbon release (CCP6, see also Canadell et al., 2021) and affecting hydrology. Predicting which species or ecosystems are vulnerable is challenging (Stephenson et al., 2019), although palaeo-ecological data (e.g., pollen, tree rings) provide context from past events to better understand current and future transformations (Nolan et al., 2018).Climate-change impacts on natural disturbances have affected ecosystems (very high confidence) (Table 14.2; see Box 14.2), and these impacts will increase with future climate change (medium confidence). Facilitated by warm, dry conditions, ‘mega-disturbances’ and synergies between disturbances that include wildfires, insect and disease outbreaks, and drought-induced tree mortality continue to affect large areas of North America (Cohen et al., 2016; Young et al., 2017a; Hicke et al., 2020), overwhelming adaptive capacities of species and degrading ecosystem services (Millar and Stephenson, 2015; Stewart et al., 2021). This era of mega-disturbances is expected to become more widespread and severe in coming decades (Cook et al., 2015; Seidl et al., 2017; Buotte et al., 2019), with potentially significant impacts on ecosystems (Allen et al., 2015; Crausbay et al., 2017; Schwalm et al., 2017; Coop et al., 2020; Dove et al., 2020 Thompson et al. 2020, Stewart et al. 2021). Effects include widespread tree mortality (Allen et al., 2015; Kane et al., 2017; van Mantgem et al., 2018) and accelerated ecosystem transformation (medium confidence) (Guiterman et al., 2018; Crausbay et al., 2020; Munson et al., 2020).
