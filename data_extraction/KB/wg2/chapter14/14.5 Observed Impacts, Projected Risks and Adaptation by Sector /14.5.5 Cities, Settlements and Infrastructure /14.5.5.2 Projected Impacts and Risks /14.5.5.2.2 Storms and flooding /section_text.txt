Annual and winter precipitation is expected to increase for most of Canada (Section 14.2; Figure 14.2D,E) and will increase flooding in cities and settlements (high confidence) (Bonsal et al., 2019). Although there is more geographic variation across the continental USA (e.g., between high-latitude and subtropical zones), extreme precipitation events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity with impacts on flood hazards (Section 14.5.3.2; Easterling et al., 2017). Winter (snow and ice) storms are expected to increase in northern North America and decrease in southern North America under RCP8.5 (Jeong and Sushama, 2018b). Projected increases in wind-driven rain exposure is an emerging consideration for moisture-resilient design and management of buildings, especially in western and northern Canada (Jeong and Cannon, 2020).
