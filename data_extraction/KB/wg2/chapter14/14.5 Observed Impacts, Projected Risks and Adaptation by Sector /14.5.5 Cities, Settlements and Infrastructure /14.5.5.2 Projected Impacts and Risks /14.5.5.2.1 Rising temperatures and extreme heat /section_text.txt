Extreme heat events are projected to increase in frequency and intensity across North America in the coming decades (Section 14.2.2; Figure 14.2F,G). Inland urban areas in the southern and eastern USA are susceptible to urban heat island effects, particularly the Midwest/Great Lakes regions (Krayenhoff et al., 2018) and also Mexico City and many other cities in Mexico (Vargas and Magaña, 2020). Climate change (RCP8.5) interacting with urban form, development and systemic racism (Schell et al., 2020; Hsu et al., 2021) could worsen risks from extreme heat in North American cities, especially where there is limited adaptation (high confidence) (Krayenhoff et al., 2018). Impacts from extreme heat will be exacerbated when multiple hazards occur simultaneously (e.g., heatwaves concurrent with droughts) (Mora et al., 2018; Zscheischler et al., 2018). Extreme heat events increase energy demand for space cooling in buildings, especially during peak demand periods and heatwaves (IEA, 2018a). This can decrease cooling efficiency, increase emissions of GHG from electricity generation, increase refrigerant loads and associated emissions, and negatively affect air quality (IEA, 2018a). Major electrical grid failure (i.e., blackouts) have increased across the USA and will continue to be particularly dangerous for human health when they coincide with extreme heat events (Stone et al., 2021). Efforts to increase resilience of the infrastructure that cities rely on are increasing (Climate-Safe Infrastructure Working Group, 2018).Warmer and/or drier conditions may reduce water supply reliability for cities and small communities that rely on surface water sources fed by rain or snowmelt runoff, for example, Victoria and Vancouver, Canada (CA-BC) (Metro Vancouver, 2016; Vadeboncoeur, 2016; Islam et al., 2017); San Pedro, Hermosillo and Los Pargas, Aguascalientes, México (MX-NW, MX-CE) (Vadeboncoeur, 2016; Soto-Montes-de-Oca and Alfie-Cohen, 2019); New York City (US-NE) (NYC Department of Environmental Protection, 2014); and Washington State (US-NW) (Section 14.5.3.2; Fosu et al., 2017).
