Extreme heat events are affecting natural assets and built infrastructure as well as individuals in cities and rural settlements across North America (high confidence) (Maria Raquel et al., 2016; Amec Foster Wheeler and Credit Valley Conservation, 2017; Howell and Brady, 2019; Martinich and Crimmins, 2019). Key urban infrastructure systems (e.g., services in buildings, energy distribution) are interdependent and susceptible to cascading impacts (e.g., electricity supply disruption during a heatwave compromising another system like water delivery, high-rise cooling) (Brown et al., 2021). Urban social inequality and systemic racism has led to disproportionately higher exposure to urban heat island effects in low-income and minority neighbourhoods in US cities, due in part, to less green space and tree cover to offset heat retained in the built environment (Hoffman et al., 2020; Schell et al., 2020; Hsu et al., 2021). In the rural context, extreme heat contributes to migration out of small communities; for example, see cases reported in Mexico (Nawrotzki et al., 2015a). Extreme heat events pose a significant risk to residents of small towns across North America due to limited resources to address heat impacts and attendant increased morbidity and mortality (Section 14.5.6.1; McDonald et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2018; Dâ€™ulisse, 2019).Hot and dry conditions increase risk of wildfires close to human settlements through collateral impacts on properties, economic activity and human health (see Box 14.2; Section 14.5.6.3). These environmental conditions also stress natural assets (e.g., urban forests, wetlands, household gardens, green walls) and performance of green infrastructure leading to higher operation and maintenance costs (high confidence) (Kabisch et al., 2017; Terton, 2017).
