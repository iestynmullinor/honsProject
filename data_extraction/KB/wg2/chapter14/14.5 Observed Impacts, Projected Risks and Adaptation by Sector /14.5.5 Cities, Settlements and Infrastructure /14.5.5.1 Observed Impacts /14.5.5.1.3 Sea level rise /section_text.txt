Sea level rise interacts with shoreline erosion, storm surge and wave action, saline intrusion and coastal flooding to directly threaten coastal cities and small communities in North America with impacts to public and private buildings and infrastructure, port and transportation facilities, water resources (high confidence) (NOAA National Weather Service, 2017; Boretti, 2019) and cultural heritage sites (see Box 14.4; Dawson et al., 2020). Sea level rise is creating conditions where considerable financial investments are needed and, in many cases, are being raised to address adaptation needs (see Box 14.4; CCP6, FatoriÄ‡ and Seekamp, 2017; Hinkel et al., 2018; Greenan et al., 2018). Across North America, high population density and concentrated development along the coast generates exposure to SLR impacts.
