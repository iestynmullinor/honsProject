Short-duration, high-intensity rainfall and other extreme events (e.g., hurricanes, atmospheric river events) create significant flooding risks and impacts for cities in North America and negatively affect the lives, livelihoods, economic activities, infrastructure and access to services (high confidence) (Amec Foster Wheeler and Credit Valley Conservation, 2017; Curry et al., 2019). In 2016, US flooding events caused 126 fatalities and 11 billion USD (considering the 2016 USD value) in damages (NOAA, 2019). In Canada, flooding accounts for 40% of the costs associated with weather-related disasters recorded since 1970 (Canadian Institute for Climate Choices, 2020); the most costly event was the 2013 Calgary flood (CA-PR) (1.8 billion CAD in catastrophic insurance losses and 6 billion CAD in direct costs such as uninsured losses) (Office of the Auditor General of Canada, 2016). Mexico City is seasonally impacted by high-intensity rainfall events that generate local flooding (de Alba and Castillo, 2014). Rural and remote settlements are also threatened by floods; Indigenous lands in Canada are disproportionately exposed to flooding, with almost 22% of residential properties at risk of a 1-in-100-year flood (Thistlethwaite et al., 2020; Yumagulova, 2020).Wind storms and hurricanes are significant climate hazards for North American cities and settlements, affecting urban forests, electricity distribution and service delivery, and damaging buildings and transportation infrastructure (Amec Foster Wheeler Environment and Infrastructure, 2017; British Columbia Hydro, 2019; Smith, 2020), with enduring impacts on small villages due to lost livelihoods and limited recovery capacity (e.g., Rio Lagartos and Las Coloradas in MX-SE after Hurricane Isidore) (Audefroy and Cabrera SÃ¡nchez, 2017). The Pacific coast of Mexico is also experiencing hurricanes such as Patricia (category IV) in 2015 and Newton (category I) in 2016 (CONAGUA, 2015; CONAGUA, 2016); hurricane Patricia affected 56 municipalities in the states of Colima, Nayarit and Jalisco (MX-CE, MX-NW) (Calleja-Reina, 2016).
