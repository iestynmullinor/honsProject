Emerging technologies and cooperative marine management are approaches to facilitate adaptation but require coordination and investment for implementation (high confidence) (Gattuso et al., 2018; Miller et al., 2018; Holsman et al., 2019; Karp et al., 2019). Advancements in oceanographic and ecological nowcasting and forecasting tools (i.e., O2, pH, temperature, aragonite saturation state, sea ice conditions) can reduce climate impacts by supporting fisheries and aquaculture adaptation along US coasts (Section 14.5.4; Cooley et al., 2015; Irby et al., 2015; Siedlecki et al., 2015; Siedlecki et al., 2016; Siddon and Zador, 2017). Forecasts and warnings reduce human exposure to HAB toxins in the Great Lakes, the west coast of Florida, east coast of Texas and the Gulf of Maine (Anderson et al., 2019).Ocean management that utilises a portfolio of nested, multi-scale, climate-informed and ecosystem-based management approaches in North American waters can increase the resilience of marine ecosystems by addressing multiple stressors simultaneously (high confidence) (Marshall et al., 2018; Holsman et al., 2019; Smale et al., 2019; Holsman et al., 2020). Integrated ecosystem assessments (Foley et al., 2013; Levin et al., 2014) are increasingly used to provide strategic advice and context for harvest allocations and bycatch avoidance (Zador et al., 2017) as well as early warnings of ecosystem-wide change (e.g., sentinel species, ecological indicators) (Cavole et al., 2016; Hazen et al., 2019; Moore and Kuletz, 2019). Dynamic ocean management policies may improve resilience of marine species and ecosystems to climate (medium confidence) (Hyrenbach et al., 2000; Maxwell et al., 2015; Dunn et al., 2016; Tommasi et al., 2017a; Tommasi et al., 2017b; Hazen et al., 2018; Wilson et al., 2018; Holsman et al., 2019; Karp et al., 2019). New proactive and rapid management approaches have been developed to minimise impacts of increasingly frequent entanglements of protected species, caused by climate-driven changes in prey and fishery activities (Corkeron et al., 2018; Meyer-Gutbrod et al., 2018). Dynamic closure areas are being used to address these issues and reduce loggerhead turtle bycatch in Hawaiian shallow-set longline fisheries (Howell et al., 2015; Lewison et al., 2015), blue whale ship-strike risk in near-real time (Hazen et al., 2017; Abrahms et al., 2019b) and bycatch of multiple top predator species in a west coast drift gillnet fishery (Hazen et al., 2018).Improved coordination and planning at multiple scales will be important for marine species conservation and recovery as species redistribute across fishery areas, marine protected zones, and international and jurisdictional boundaries (Section 14.5.4; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE in Chapter 5; Pinsky et al., 2018; Karp et al., 2019). Indigenous Peoples’ co-management with federal and state partners of marine resources and protected species is an important approach (Section 14.5.4; Chapters 5 and 6; CCP6; Galappaththi et al., 2019).Securing broodstocks for rebuilding and supplementation can be challenging for marine populations already in decline (e.g., blue king crab in Alaska, steelhead salmon in Puget Sound, white abalone in California, groundfish in the northeast USA and Canada) (Section 14.5.4; Table SM14.8). Marine protected areas can attenuate climate impacts through trophic redundancy, preserving ecological processes, biodiversity and climate refugia (Roberts et al., 2017a; Schoen et al., 2017), although benefits decrease after mid-century (or sooner for high-latitude marine protected areas) as species reach their thermal limit, unless coupled with GHG mitigation (Bruno et al., 2018). Transport, relocation and cultivation of resistant breeds of salmon, oysters, corals, marine mammals and other keystone species, as well as hatchery supplementation of impaired populations of fish and shellfish, are species conservation and recovery methods that will be in greater demand under climate change, although unintended environmental impacts must be considered. Options for protecting and restoring coral reefs to prevent loss of ecosystem function are under development with Florida reef species (Gattuso et al., 2018; National Academies of Sciences, 2019). An emerging approach for financing the protection of reefs involves re-categorising reefs as ‘natural infrastructure’ which has allowed for use of insurance to rebuild lost reefs (Storlazzi et al., 2019).
