Climate change is projected to amplify current trends in water resource impacts, potentially reducing water supply security, impairing water quality and increasing flood hazards to varying degrees across North America (high confidence).

Increased water scarcity will intensify the need to address competing interests across state and national boundaries, including honouring commitments to Indigenous Peoples who have long struggled with inadequate access to their water entitlements and marginalisation in water resource planning (Mumme, 1999; Cozzetto et al., 2013b; Mumme, 2016; McNeeley, 2017; Radonic, 2017; Robison et al., 2018; Curley, 2019; Water and Tribes Initiative, 2020; Wilder et al., 2020).Increased scarcity of renewable water relative to legally allocated or desired uses may develop in many parts of North America. A detailed analysis of projected water demands (consumptive uses) and availability found increasingly frequent shortages in several watersheds across the USA (Brown et al., 2019b). This might lead to maladaptive increased groundwater mining, or alternatively to policies promoting sustainable balancing of water consumption with renewable supplies, for example, by facilitating voluntary water transfers or improving enforcement of groundwater rights (Colorado River Basin Stakeholders, 2015; California Natural Resources Agency et al., 2020; Colorado Water Conservation Board, 2020; Pauloo et al., 2020).Climate change is projected to reduce groundwater recharge in major southwest US aquifers (e.g., Southern High Plains, San Pedro and Wasatch Front), exacerbating their ongoing depletion due to unsustainable pumping. Other aquifers, especially those farther north, face uncertain or possibly increasing recharge (medium confidence) (Meixner et al., 2016).Projected changes in temperature and precipitation present direct risks to North American water quality, varying with regional and watershed contexts (Chapra et al., 2017; Coffey et al., 2019; Paul et al., 2019a), and related to streamflow, population growth (Duran-Encalada et al., 2017) and land-use practices (medium confidence) (Mehdi et al., 2015). Harmful algal blooms increase in frequency across the USA (Wells et al., 2015) with the highest risk projected for the Great Plains and Northeast USA, and greatest economic impacts from lost recreation value in the southeast USA (Chapra et al., 2017).The diversity of climate regimes across North America results in regional differences in water-related climate-change risks (Figure 14.4).
