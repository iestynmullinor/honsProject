Sea level rise, increased storm surge, wave action, algae blooms, extreme air temperatures, and changes in wind and precipitation patterns threaten coastal tourism infrastructure, submerge beaches, erode walking paths on coasts, and impact destination attractiveness, tourism demand and recreation economies (very high confidence). Warm weather tourism activities, including beach tourism, snorkelling and national park visitation, will have more time to implement adaptation strategies to reduce climate risks as significant and widespread impacts are not expected until 3°C–4°C of warming (Figure 14.9; Rutty and Scott, 2015; Atzori et al., 2018; Santos-Lacueva et al., 2018; Duro and Turrión-Prats, 2019). Thirty percent of hotels along the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea are exposed to flooding and 66% are located on eroding beaches (Lithgow et al., 2019). Coral reef cover in Akumal Bay, Mexico, decreased by 79% between 2011 and 2014 (Gil et al., 2015; Manuel-Navarrete and Pelling, 2015). The recreation value of coral reef tourism in Florida, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii is expected to decrease by 90% by mid-century under RCP8.5 (Section 14.4.2; EPA, 2017). Wildfires and insect outbreaks have contributed to reduced desirability for tourism across forest and mountain regions (Bawa, 2017; Hestetune et al., 2018; White et al., 2020). Visitors to Utah’s National Parks declined 0.5–1.5% during wildfire years between 1993 and 2015, resulting in 2.7–4.5 million USD in lost revenue (see Box 14.2; Kim and Jakus, 2019). Trees damaged by insects have caused campground and hiking trail closures in the western USA and Alaska (Arnberger et al., 2018). Seal level rise, flooding, coastal erosion, changing air and sea temperatures, changing humidity and extreme weather events are putting cultural heritage sites at risk (Fatorić and Seekamp, 2017; Hollesen et al., 2018; Tetu et al., 2019).
