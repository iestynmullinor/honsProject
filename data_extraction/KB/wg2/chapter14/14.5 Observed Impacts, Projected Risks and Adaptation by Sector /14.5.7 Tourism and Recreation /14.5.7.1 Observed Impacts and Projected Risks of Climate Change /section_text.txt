Cruise and yacht tourism in the North American Arctic have increased rapidly over the past decade as changes in sea ice has expanded open-water areas and season length  (Johnston et al., 2016; Pizzolato et al., 2016; Dawson et al., 2018). The risk of a major accident or incident among Arctic-going yachts and some expedition passenger vessels is very high relative to other ships (high confidence) due to the combined increases in mobile ice, especially along the Northwest Passage (Barber et al., 2018a; Howell and Brady, 2019; Copland et al., 2021; Lemmen et al., 2021), limited regulation for private yachts (Dawson et al., 2014; Dawson et al., 2017), the propensity for cruise ships to travel into newly ice-free and poorly charted areas, and the increasing number of non-ice-strengthened vessels operating in the region (Dawson et al., 2018; Copland et al., 2019; Copland et al., 2021). Compounding risks include a lack of hydrographic charting and the lack of emergency response infrastructure (e.g., spill response, search and rescue, salvage) (Amap, 2017). Tourism demand for polar bear viewing in Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, may change due to climate-related declines in polar bear health (Gil et al., 2015; Manuel-Navarrete and Pelling, 2015), but may be offset by ‘Last Chance Tourism’ (LCT), a niche tourism market of individuals who explicitly seek to visit vanishing landscapes and/or disappearing flora and fauna (Lemelin et al., 2010). The ethics of promoting LCT has been questioned considering that more visitation to sensitive sites increases local impacts as well as travel-related emissions (Groulx et al., 2016; Groulx et al., 2019).
