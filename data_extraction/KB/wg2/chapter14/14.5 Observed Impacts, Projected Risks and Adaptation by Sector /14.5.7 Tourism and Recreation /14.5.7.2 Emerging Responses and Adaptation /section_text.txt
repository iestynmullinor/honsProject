Compared with other economic sectors (Section 14.5.8), the tourism industry has high adaptive capacity (high confidence) (Figure 14.9). Investments in climate-resilient infrastructure within Canadian National Parks have increased visitation rates during the shoulder seasons (Fisichelli et al., 2015; Lemieux et al., 2017; Wilkins et al., 2018), regional collaboration among US and Canadian park agencies has enhanced adaptive capacity through integrated planning and management (Lemieux et al., 2015), and technological advancements have reduced the vulnerability of alpine winter sports from warming temperatures (e.g., snowmaking, refrigerated surfaces, chemical additives) (Rutty and Scott, 2015; Scott et al., 2019b; Scott et al., 2020). Snowmaking as an adaptation strategy affects mitigation efforts by increasing the need for energy and fuel (Scott et al., 2019b).Tourists are also highly adaptable and, depending on their levels of place attachment, location loyalty and socio-demographics, are very likely  to substitute the timing or location of their travel activity based on climate and climatic-driven environmental changes (Rutty and Scott, 2015; Atzori et al., 2018). Lemieux (2017) found that if the state of the Athabasca Glacier (CA-PR) (Figure 14.1) were to change negatively as a result of climate change, 83% would travel elsewhere, and if large infrastructure were built as an adaptive measure for viewing receding glaciers at Jasper National Park, 40% of tourists would no longer visit.Hard and soft limits to adaptation exist in the tourism sector (Manuel-Navarrete and Pelling, 2015). For example, machine-made snow, without the use of environmentally harmful chemical additives that are banned in most jurisdictions, can only be made efficiently in temperatures below −2°C, but projections indicate warming temperatures above this threshold (Wobus et al., 2017; Scott et al., 2019a). Multi-jurisdictional adaptation planning for parks and protected areas in the USA has been hindered by a lack of funding and communication, and funding trade-offs that could be remedied through coordination (Lemieux et al., 2015). Social inequalities generated by the tourism development process must also be considered by climate-related interventions to prevent the perpetuation of inequalities that may exist, particularly in less developed regions and rapidly developing regions. For example, new developments in Hawaii, Florida, Quebec and popular resort areas in Mexico have led to social inequalities through increased property taxes leading to the marginalisation of local residents away from these areas in favour of wealthy tourists (Section 14.5.9; Manuel-Navarrete and Pelling, 2015).
