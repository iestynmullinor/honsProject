Climate change poses risks to peace (Section 16.5.2.3.8) that could affect North America (medium confidence). Military and security communities are adapting their planning, operations and infrastructure to current impacts of climate change in North America and globally (medium agreement, medium evidence). Arctic nations are renewing their military capacity and expanding their constabulary presence around their existing boundaries (Choi, 2020). There is increasing awareness that climate change causes weather patterns and extreme events that directly harm military installations and readiness through infrastructure damage, loss of utilities, and loss of operational capability (Duffy-Anderson et al., 2019). Transboundary disputes and competition over resources, such as fish (Østhagen, 2020), are a concern in the changing Arctic and increases in military and constabulary operations are being observed (Jönsson et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2018; Eyzaguirre et al., 2021).
