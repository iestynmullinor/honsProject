Co-benefits from adaptation options include improving the liveability of, and quality of life in, cities, reducing socioeconomic vulnerability and exposure to locally higher temperatures (medium confidence). Urban settings in the USA have disproportionately higher exposure to urban heat island effects in low-income and minority neighbourhoods in US cities (Section 14.5.5.1). Co-benefits from adaptation responses in the urban landscape can reduce socioeconomic vulnerabilities and exposure to higher temperatures (Section 14.5.5.3). Evaluation of adaptation efforts to reduce crime rates that have been associated with temperature are limited. In Los Angeles, a link has been inferred between violence and older buildings that may lack air conditioning (Heilmann et al., 2021). By contrast, access to air conditioning did not appear to lessen crime rates in Mexico (Baysan et al., 2019).
