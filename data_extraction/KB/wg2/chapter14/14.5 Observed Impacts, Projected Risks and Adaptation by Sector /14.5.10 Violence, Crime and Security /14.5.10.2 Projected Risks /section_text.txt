Climate change will affect ecosystems (Section 16.5.2.3), living standards (Section 16.5.2.3.4), health (Section 16.5.2.3.5) and food security (Section 16.5.2.3.6) globally, and these changes may exacerbate violence and political instability (medium confidence) with implications for national security in North America (medium confidence). Climate variability, hazards and trends, to date, have played a role in exacerbating conflict, but the influence of climate appears to be minor and more uncertain than the roles of low socioeconomic development, low state capability and high intergroup inequality (Mach et al., 2019). More profound impacts from climate change on weather and seasons, as well as changing socioeconomic conditions, could lead to patterns of violence that cannot be predicted by projecting relationships between current climate and violence into the future (Section 14.6.3; Mach et al., 2019). If global levels of violence increase, there will be increased demand for international efforts, including disaster aid and humanitarian efforts (Eyzaguirre et al., 2021). Climate change and geopolitical goals interact in the Arctic (Smith et al., 2018). New transportation corridors and the potential access to natural resources could lead to competition for access to and control over the region (Section CCP6.2.6; see Box CCP6.1; FAQ CCP6.2; Estrada, 2021). Governance structures exist to manage geopolitical manoeuvring and to protect the human security of Arctic populations (Sections 14.5.10.3, 7.2.7.1).
