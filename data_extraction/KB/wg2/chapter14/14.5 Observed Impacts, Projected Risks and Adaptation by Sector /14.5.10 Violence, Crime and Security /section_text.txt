Existing environmental and international agreements that consider climate risks can contribute to cooperation (medium confidence).  Strengthening and empowering existing environmental and diplomatic avenues (e.g., the Arctic Council and international agreements such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and various subnational actors and agreements) (Section CCP6.3.2) to incorporate risks from climate impacts could enhance cooperative avenues for defusing conflict (Huebert et al., 2012). Improving the consideration of climate risks in efforts to expand economies and trade (see Box 14.5), and improvements in peacekeeping (Section 7.4.4; Barnett, 2018) could also reduce future conflict risks.
