Climate change and its projected impacts pose a substantial risk to North America as a region as well as to sectors, communities and individuals (Section 14.6.2). Incorporating different values and knowledge systems, consideration of equity and justice as core objectives and addressing underlying vulnerabilities are principles that can guide transformational adaptation and resilience (medium confidence).Approaches that advance adaptation within the existing contexts (finances, institutions and processes) have been increasingly promoted by governments to mainstream climate risk into all considerations (Rosenzweig and Solecki, 2014; Van der Brugge and Roosjen, 2015; Boon et al., 2021; Shi and Moser, 2021). Policies and programmes that build upon existing approaches that have inherent climate resilience including Indigenous knowledge-based land and resource management (Section 14.5.4), co-management of agriculture and freshwater resources (Section 14.5.3), NbS (see Box 14.7), links between health and equity, and ecosystem-based management (Sections 14.5.2–14.5.4) have advanced sustainable and equitable climate resilience. Implementing the recommendations in the ASCE committee’s report on adaptation to a changing climate (2018a) and Canada’s Infrastructure and Buildings Working Group report has been identified as an opportunity to improve social equity by ensuring the resilience of infrastructure and the services it provides, through adoption of standards and good asset management practices (Amec Foster Wheeler Environment and Infrastructure, 2017; ASCE, 2018a).Long-term policy signals to incentivise ongoing, scalable adaptation action that is coordinated with mitigation efforts will increase actions and prevent potential maladaptive investment (Moser, 2018; Shi and Moser 2021). Using SDG goals and the NDCs as a framework for inclusive and coordinated partnership and vertical integration across subnational, national and regional planning can promote climate resilient development (CRD) (Section 18.1.3). Coordination of policies and responses have been identified as supporting longer-term, transformational adaptation and minimising risk (Termeer et al., 2017; Fazey et al., 2018). New approaches for enabling and incentivising transformative adaptation in North America are rapidly emerging (Colloff et al. 2017; Fedel et al. 2019; Werners et al. 2021). Evaluation of the feasibility of evolving adaptation strategies is only in the early stages, but recent work has provided the foundation for assessing these considerations (Table 14.7; Chapter 16).Differing values, perspectives, interests and needs of relevant actors (Dittrich et al., 2016) through participatory processes, such as co-production of knowledge (Meadow et al., 2015; Wall et al., 2017), have been incorporated through the Resilience Dialogues 2117  and the development of guidance on climate scenarios (Chaumont, 2014). Framing of adaptation goals strongly determines beneficiaries of resultant policies and underscores the importance of a plurality of perspectives in adaptation governance (Cochran et al., 2013; Plummer, 2013; Allison and Bassett, 2015; Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel, 2018). Sustained engagement through iterative knowledge development, learning and negotiation has been identified as core for addressing climate risks (Kates et al., 2012; Seijger et al., 2014). Interdisciplinary and inclusive adaptation programmes that embrace and plan for conflict and resolution, and address inequalities, have been part of broadening the opportunities for engagement (Cantú, 2016; Termeer et al., 2017; Parlee and Wiber, 2018; Sterner et al., 2019; Haasnoot et al., 2020).Equity and justice in climate adaptation have been identified as providing a foundation for resilience in natural, social and built systems (Cochran et al., 2013; Reckien et al., 2017; Schell et al., 2020). This approach recognises that social vulnerability undermines efforts to increase adaptive capacity and that adaptation may also entrench existing social inequities, such as marginalisation of communities of colour, gender discrimination, legacy effects of colonisation and gentrification of coastal communities (Schell et al., 2020; Thomas, 2020). Thus, identifying systemic racism and the effects of colonialism within and across institutions has also been identified as part of achieving more just and equitable adaptation (Shi and Moser 2021). Acknowledgement and incorporation of IK in adaptation planning and implementation also recognises Indigenous sovereignty issues and the importance of the equitable role of Indigenous self-determination in governance and planning (see Box 14.1; Section 14.4; Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel, 2018).Strategies have been emerging to facilitate progress by including specific guidance on tools for financing and funding climate-change adaptation infrastructure (Berry and Danielson, 2015; Chen et al., 2016; Zerbe, 2019). This includes facilitating transitions between incremental and transformational efforts to facilitate CRD (Figure 14.12; Chapter 18).The extent to which resilient infrastructure contributes to social justice and equity has also been taken into consideration (Climate-Safe Infrastructure Working Group, 2018; Doorn, 2019). Proactive actions focused on small towns and rural areas—including the interdependencies between cities and surrounding areas—increases the potential that small and medium cities can build adaptive capacity at a pace that is commensurate with present and future risks (Moss et al., 2019; Vodden and Cunsolo, 2021). This coordination also creates greater opportunity for translation of knowledge into practice and assessing knowledge in the context that it is to be applied to improve decision making across scales (Enquist et al., 2017; Moss et al., 2019).
