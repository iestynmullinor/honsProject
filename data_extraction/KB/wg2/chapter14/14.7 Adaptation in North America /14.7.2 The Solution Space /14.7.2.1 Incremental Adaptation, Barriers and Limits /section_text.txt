Adaptation actions to moderate the effects of climate impacts are well documented in North America and have buffered much of the past and currently observed climate impacts (e.g., Lempert et al., 2018; Lemmen et al., 2021). While it is challenging to catalogue adaptation activities, as many are not published or are not necessarily undertaken with climate adaptation as the primary rationale (Section 1.3.2.2), most of the activities identified by sector in this chapter have been primarily incremental adaptation measures (medium evidence, high agreement ). Many actions are extensions of existing practices for managing climate variability and there is broad agreement that worsening future conditions will exceed the capacity of many of these efforts (Kates et al., 2012; Termeer et al., 2017; Fazey et al., 2018; Fedele et al., 2019; Shi and Moser, 2021).Progress in adaptation planning and implementation between regions in North America is uneven (Table 14.6; see Box 14.7; Bierbaum et al., 2013; Moser et al., 2017; Auditors General, 2018; INECC and Semarnat, 2018; Shi and Moser, 2021). At the local level (cities) in the USA, commitment of elected officials, financial resources and awareness of climate-change hazards and risks have been identified as driving the variation in climate adaptation (Shi et al., 2015). Adaptation programmes have come under budgetary and political pressures that limit continuity of efforts (Moss et al., 2019). Implementation of adaptation has also faced challenges due to institutional arrangements, constraints and gaps that prevent different levels of government, social organisations and academia to act in an integrated and timely way to consider biodiversity, agriculture and water systems (e.g., see Box 14.7; Bourne et al., 2016; Nalau et al., 2018)Table 14.6 | Adaptation trends and progress across sectors.

Lack of representation, health inequities and economic constraints adversely affect the capacity to respond to change and further exacerbate marginalisation. For example, within many water basins in Canada and the USA, planning processes are often hampered by conflicting interests, asymmetrical information and differential power (ICLEI Canada, 2016; Nordgren et al., 2016; Woodruff and Stults, 2016).The absence of evidence about the current effectiveness of proposed adaptation actions to guide future actions and investments presents a serious risk to North America, especially at higher GWLs (medium confidence). Evaluating the limits to adaptation and the effectiveness of adaptation actions is hindered by a lack of monitoring and evaluation (Auditors General, 2018; Dilling et al., 2019; Berrang-Ford et al., 2021). Incremental, passive adaptations are often characterised by soft  limits due to differing access to resources and by perceptions and tolerance of risk (Moser, 2010; Dow et al., 2013). At current warming levels, social–ecological systems have been reaching limits to adaptation in regions with high exposure and high sensitivity (medium confidence). However, the implications for adaptation are unclear as soft adaptation limits are mutable and change with evolving knowledge, values, interests and perspectives involved in decision making (Adger et al., 2009; Moser et al., 2017). Hard limits have been identified for some natural systems, such as species extinctions (Sections 14.5.2.1, 14.5.1.3; Table 14.2).Adaptation actions in one place or sector can have adverse side effects elsewhere (medium confidence). For example, increased use of groundwater for irrigation in response to aridification can reduce baseflows into rivers with adverse impacts on stream ecology and water availability for communities far downstream (Section 14.5.3). Additionally, across multiple sectors in North America, adaptation actions have tended to be sector specific rather than integrating across systems (Gao and Bryan, 2017; Fulton et al., 2019), despite the increasing awareness of cascading impacts and interdependencies (Zimmerman and Faris, 2010; C40 Cities and AECOM, 2017) and risks from possible ecological and social thresholds that have been identified under higher GWL (Section 14.6.3). For example, the water, energy and food nexus in North America has highlighted that food, water and energy security depend on transportation infrastructure (Section 14.5.8.1.2; Romero-Lankao et al., 2018).
