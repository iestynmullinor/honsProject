In response to some of the challenges presented in Section 14.7.2.1, substantial progress has been made in the North American context on the development of climate services, indicators, sustained assessments, and participatory and stakeholder-driven robust decision making (medium confidence) (Fazey et al., 2018; Fedele et al., 2019; Moss et al., 2019; Boon et al., 2021; Werners et al., 2021).Decision making related to adaptation policies, plans and projects has become more formalised, emphasising participatory governance and co-production of knowledge. Canada has improved capacity with its Canadian Expert Panel on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience Results and the recent National Adaptation Plan (Section 14.7.1.5), with the development of a series of indicators to measure progress on adaptation (EPCCAR, 2018; Government of Canada, 2021a). In the USA, indicators have been developed to communicate climate risks and guide adaptation efforts from federal (Kenney et al., 2020) to more regional initiatives (Kenney and Gerst, 2021). These climate indicators have been used to support user-driven assessments and to articulate adaptation goals (Moss et al., 2019; Kenney et al., 2020); however, these frameworks have not sufficiently incorporated monitoring and evaluation into adaptation plans (Lempert et al., 2018; Kenney et al., 2020). Tools and services to facilitate risk assessment and action planning have been made available through federal government climate service efforts, and guidance for their use has been developed (Vano et al., 2018); however, these products have been characterised as insufficiently developed to allow all adaptation practitioners to use these services (Meerow and Mitchell, 2017).Throughout North America, co-development (or co-production) of adaptation efforts among stakeholders who share common climate vulnerabilities or risk levels (e.g., individuals, groups, communities, businesses or institutions) has been a core attribute of adaptation planning (Mees et al., 2016) and ranges across many sectors (e.g., Sections 14.5.2.2, 14.5.3.3, 14.5.4.3). Participatory efforts and robust decision making have also been observed; some integrated watershed planning processes have high degrees of sustained stakeholder involvement (Section 14.5.3.3; FAQ 14.4; Harris-Lovett et al., 2015; Cant√∫, 2016).
