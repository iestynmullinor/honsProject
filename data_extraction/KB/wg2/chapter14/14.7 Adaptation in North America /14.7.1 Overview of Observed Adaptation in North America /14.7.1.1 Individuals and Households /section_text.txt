Across North America, individuals and households have taken action to reduce climate-influenced risks (high confidence). These autonomous adaptations comprise the majority of the observed responses in the peer-reviewed literature (Berrang-Ford and et al., 2021). The increased use of cooling systems (which could be maladaptive unless there are innovations) (Section 14.5.5.3; Barreca et al., 2016), creating defensible space around homes in wildfire-prone areas (see Box 14.2), and the modification or redesign of housing structures along coasts (Koerth et al., 2017), are important household responses to existing risks. Although these actions have played a role in reducing risks, the capacity to undertake such actions is not uniform across individuals in North America and has exacerbated existing social inequities, especially in coastal areas (Keenan et al., 2018; de Koning and Filatova, 2020). Additionally, these adaptation activities often are taken without consideration of the impact on mitigation efforts (Kates et al., 2012; Fedele et al., 2019; Shi and Moser, 2021).
