The majority of local jurisdictions in North America have undertaken some level of adaptation. These efforts largely have focused on planning and less on implementation (high confidence). Some subnational governments, namely states and provinces, have engaged in advanced adaptation planning efforts (high confidence). Indigenous Peoples in North America have undertaken substantial activities (Section 14.4; see Box 14.1).Many cities across North America have undertaken adaptation planning (Section 14.5; Hughes, 2015; Reich et al., 2016; Moser et al., 2017; Auditors General, 2018; McMillan et al., 2019) with some financing adaptation implementation, for example, in the case of SLR (see Box 14.4). Adaptation actions commonly implemented in cities include climate-informed building codes, enacting energy conservation measures, modifying zoning and increasing green infrastructure (Section 14.5.5.3; see Box 14.7; Binder et al., 2015; Maxwell et al., 2018a; Moss et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2021). The majority of cities have formed practitioner networks to share information (ICLEI Canada, 2016; Vogel et al., 2016; C40 Cities, 2018) and supporting learning and collaboration through regional collaborations that include utility managers and the private sector (FÃ¼nfgeld, 2015; Moser et al., 2017).In Canada, the Map of Adaptation Actions 106  presents over 200 adaptation case studies addressing a variety of climate-related impacts (Warren and Lulham, 2021). The City of Saskatoon, in developing its Climate Action Plan (which includes a Corporate Climate Adaptation Strategy), engaged with local businesses, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), residents and experts to identify potential risks (and benefits) requiring action (City of Saskatoon, 2019). Similarly, the City of Surrey specifically used community outreach programmes to develop its Coastal Flood Adaptation Strategy (CFAS) through a value-based planning approach (City of Surrey, 2019). Municipal asset management, local services and community well-being were key considerations for the City of Selkirk, Manitoba, when developing an adaptation strategy as well as ensuring a budgeting process that supports implementation (City of Selkirk, 2019). As of 2019, 8 of 13 Canadian provinces and territories have high-level climate adaptation strategies. The scope of these efforts vary by jurisdiction as a review conducted by federal and provincial auditors in Canada identified several deficiencies related to a lack of detailed implementation plans, obligated funding and specific timelines (Auditors General, 2018).Progress in Mexico on adaptation implementation at the local level has been extensive (INECC and Semarnat, 2018). Activities include executing programmes for relocating infrastructure in high-risk zones in priority tourist sites, incorporating adaptation criteria in public investment projects that involve construction and infrastructure management, water management, application of climate adaptation norms for the construction of tourist buildings in coastal zones, and improving the security of key water, communication and transportation infrastructure (Sections 14.5.5, 14.5.7, 14.5.8). Additionally, local capacity and protocol to respond to extreme weather events as a function of climate change have been integrated more regularly into community-based hazard mitigation plans. States and municipalities in Mexico must have climate policies that are consistent with the guidelines of national strategies (Section 14.7.1.5) and state-level programmes on climate change, in addition to other state and municipal laws. As a result, these entities have developed and implemented early warning systems designed to protect the population from climate-related risks, such as strong storms and hurricanes (INECC and Semarnat, 2018).Implementation of adaptation initiatives and specific actions in US cities has increased in the approximately 5 years between the 3rd US National Climate Assessment (NCA3) (Melillo et al., 2014) and the 4th Assessment (NCA4), and adaptation responses have been observed widely (Lempert et al., 2018). ICLEI-USA provides numerous resources for adaptation planning and implementation for cities, Indigenous Peoples and Regional Governments 11. 7 The Georgetown Center for Climate maintains a comprehensive resource for tracking adaptation progress for States 12. 8 As of 2021, 18 US states have completed climate adaptation plans, and six states have plans underway as of the time of this report (Georgetown Climate Center, 2021). California, in particular, has adopted sustained climate assessment to allow for more rapid iterations on adaptation planning (Bedsworth et al., 2018; Miao, 2019). Across all US states, however, adaptation activities do not have readily accessible budgets, such that levels of funding cannot be assessed directly (Gilmore and St. Clair, 2018).
