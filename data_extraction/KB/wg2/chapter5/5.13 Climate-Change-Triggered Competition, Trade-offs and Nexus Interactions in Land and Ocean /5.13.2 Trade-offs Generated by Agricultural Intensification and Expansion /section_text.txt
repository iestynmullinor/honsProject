Agricultural intensification seeks to increase agricultural productivity per input unit, reducing the pressure on land use and generating positive impacts in GHG emissions (Mbow et al., 2019), but valuing the final effect requires common metrics in terms of carbon capture or emission reductions (Searchinger et al., 2018). It has been suggested to address multiple SDGs (SDG2, SDG13, SDG15) but only occasionally leads to simultaneous positive ecosystem service and well-being outcomes (Rasmussen et al., 2018). When the process relies only on increasing input use, there is a risk of generating adverse outcomes that may override positive effects, such as CO2 emissions, (McGill et al., 2018), NOx emissions (Hickman et al., 2017), soil salinisation and groundwater depletion (Doody et al., 2015; Daliakopoulos et al., 2016; Fragaszy and Closas, 2016; Foster et al., 2018; Flörke et al., 2019). Agricultural intensification could meet short-term food security and livelihood goals, but reduces biological and landscape diversity, and ecosystem services (high confidence) (Campbell et al., 2017; Balmford et al., 2018; Springmann et al., 2018; Ickowitz et al., 2019; Mbow et al., 2019). Agricultural intensification can also affect livelihoods of small-scale producers, compromising food security. It can increase low-waged casual farm work, increasing gender and income inequity (Bigler et al., 2017; Clay and King, 2019; Table 5.18).Land available for provisioning ecosystem services is declining in many places because of agricultural expansion, bioenergy crops and reforestation for mitigation (Kongsager, 2018), with adverse climate impacts (Froese and Schilling, 2019). Cropland expansion can deteriorate biodiversity (Delzeit et al., 2017), water quality (Ayala et al., 2016) and carbon storage (Goldstein et al., 2012) and increase water demands (Yokohata et al., 2020).A systems-based perspective on land use is needed to address climate change impacts on nutrition security and ecosystem services (Springmann et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019b; Willett et al., 2019). Land sparing sets aside some land for conservation purposes and intensifies production on farmland (Balmford et al., 2018; Benton et al., 2018; IPCC, 2019b), with potential to offset GHG emissions (Lamb et al., 2016). Alternatively, ‘land sharing’ approach employs principles such as minimising fossil-fuel-based inputs, maximising synergies, and addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as biodiversity (Kremen and Miles, 2012; Kremen, 2015; Kremen and Merenlender, 2018; HLPE, 2019; Section 5.1 4, Box on Agroecology). Community-managed initiatives can address biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, livelihoods, food provisioning and other ecosystem services (Kremen and Merenlender, 2018; HLPE, 2019).The concept of sustainable intensification has emerged, looking for enhancements in environmental outcomes, while maintaining or increasing agricultural systems performance. There is a potential to find synergies between agricultural production and landscape systems if systems are designed to operate within planetary boundaries (Rockström et al., 2017; Liao and Brown, 2018; Pretty, 2018; Pretty et al., 2018).
