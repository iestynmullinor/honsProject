Flooding on agricultural land will enhance nutrient runoff, creating eutrophication and increasing harmful phytoplankton blooms, affecting fisheries and aquaculture, human health and ecosystem biodiversity. Changes in precipitation, monsoons, runoff and flood potential combine with deforestation and poor sewage treatment, resulting in larger volumes of nutrients and freshwater reaching coastal ecosystems (Jin et al., 2018; Nasonova et al., 2018; Tamm et al., 2018). Rising surface temperatures, ocean acidification and eutrophication will increase pathogenic Vibrio bacterial loads in marine organisms, with potential transfer to humans (Hernroth and Baden, 2018). Shallow and microtidal estuaries will be more vulnerable to changing river runoffs and saltwater intrusions, eutrophication and hypoxia (high confidence) (IPCC, 2019c).
