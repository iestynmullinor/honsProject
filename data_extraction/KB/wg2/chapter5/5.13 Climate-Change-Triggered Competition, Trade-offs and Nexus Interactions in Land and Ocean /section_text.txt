Maladaptation can result in three types of outcomes (Juhola et al., 2016): (1)rebounding vulnerability: short term adaptations that decrease adaptive capacity and hinder future choices; (2)shifting vulnerability: larger-scale adaptation actions that produce spill-over effects in other locations; (3)eroding sustainable development : adaptation strategies which increase emissions and deteriorate environmental conditions and/or social and economic values (Tables 5.20 and 5.21).Existing climate policies do not adequately consider trade-offs, adaptive limits, cumulative costs and potential risks of maladaptation (robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Dovie, 2017; Holsman et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019b; Work et al., 2019; Thomas, 2020: Table 5.19). Government policies are seldom coordinated across scales and often focused on regional short-term risks (medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Dovie, 2017; Holsman et al., 2019; Rahman and Hickey, 2019; Butler et al., 2020). Past development trajectories and dominant political economic structures may narrow adaptation pathways, be restrictive and increase the vulnerability of particular groups (Paprocki, 2018; Quan et al., 2019; Rahman and Hickey, 2019; Work et al., 2019).Table 5.19 | Case studies of trade-offs and negative outcomes associated with agricultural intensification on biodiversity and ecosystem services.Ecosystem serviceTrade-offs/negative outcomesReferencesProvisioning: water qualityNegative impacts on ephemeral wetlandsDalu et al.
