Land deals, also known as large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs), describe recent changes in access to land globally (Borras et al., 2011). Since 2000, at least 160 million hectares have been under negotiation (Land Matrix, 2021). Land deals surged after the 2007–2008 food price crisis and farmland investment boom (Fairbairn, 2014), with a diverse range of drivers (Arezki et al., 2015; Zoomers and Otsuki, 2017; Conigliani et al., 2018) including land-based climate change interventions (Dunlap and Fairhead, 2014; Davis et al., 2015a; Hunsberger et al., 2017; Franco and Borras, 2019). Examples are the expansion of biofuel crops (e.g., Yengoh and Armah, 2016; Aha and Ayitey, 2017), afforestation and reforestation (A/R) projects (Olwig et al., 2016; Richards and Lyons, 2016; Scheidel and Work, 2018), REDD+ (Bayrak and Marafa, 2016; Ingalls et al., 2018), conservation areas (Lunstrum, 2016; Schleicher et al., 2019), renewable energy installations (e.g., Sovacool, 2021) or natural disaster management (e.g. Uson, 2017).Land deals raise important social justice questions (Franco et al., 2017; Hunsberger et al., 2017; Borras and Franco, 2018b; Borras et al., 2020; Sekine, 2021) (high confidence). Specific impacts of land deals vary according to their purpose, location, actors, land use history and procedural aspects. However, multi-case analyses identify severe adverse impacts (Table 5.18). LSLAs are a significant driver of tropical forest loss (Davis et al., 2020), increasing emissions through deforestation (Liao et al., 2021) and industrialisation of agriculture (Rosa et al., 2021). LSLAs entail large water appropriations (Breu et al., 2016; Chiarelli et al., 2016; Adams et al., 2019), affecting local populations’ access to water and food security (Dell’Angelo et al., 2018; Veldwisch et al., 2018). By increasing exported crops, and limiting local populations’ access to land, LSLAs produce food security risks (Marselis et al., 2017; Müller et al., 2021b). Negative livelihoods impacts arise through enclosure of assets, elite capture (Oberlack et al., 2016), crowding out of small farmers (Nolte and Ostermeier, 2017) and reducing local populations’ access to commons (Dell’Angelo et al., 2016; Giger et al., 2019). Indigenous People are affected, facing high levels of violence in land acquisition conflicts (Dell’Angelo et al., 2021). The social burdens of land deals tend to be gendered (e.g., Fonjong et al., 2016; Nyantakyi-Frimpong and Bezner Kerr, 2017; Atuoye et al., 2021).Table 5.18 | Adverse social and ecological risks and impacts of agricultural land deals on land use and vulnerable groups.Land use dimensionsImpacts and implicationsReferences (2014 to present)  ForestryDirect and indirect land use change provoked by LSLAs accelerates deforestation of tropical forests globally (medium confidence).Multi-case analysesDavis et al.

Vulnerable groups displaced by land deals may face higher exposure to climate change (Dell’Angelo et al., 2017). LSLAs affecting common-pool resources governed by Indigenous institutions jeopardise the resilience and adaptive capacity of local socio-ecological systems (Dell’Angelo et al., 2016; D’Odorico et al., 2017; Hak et al., 2018; Haller, 2019; Haller et al., 2020). Growing land tenure insecurity may force farmers to engage in unsustainable farming and forestry practices (Aha and Ayitey, 2017; Gabay and Alam, 2017) and hinder agroecological innovations to manage climate risks (Nyantakyi-Frimpong, 2020b). Social justice concerns and vulnerability of local populations can be addressed by promoting land redistribution and recognition, particularly for customary lands of Indigenous and ethnic minorities, and land restitution to those who were forcibly displaced (Franco et al., 2015; Borras and Franco, 2018a).
