A human rights-based approach (HRBA), endorsed by the UN, is one strategy for addressing core inequities that are key drivers for food insecurity and malnutrition of particular groups such as low-income consumers, children, women, small-scale producers and different regions of the world (FAO, 2013; Claeys and Delgado Pugley, 2017; Caron et al., 2018; Le Mouël et al., 2018; Springmann et al., 2018; Tramel, 2018; HLPE, 2019; Willett et al., 2019). Climate change impacts, mitigation and adaptation approaches can also worsen inequities (Eastin, 2018; Borras et al., 2020). HRBA includes core principles of participation, accountability, non-discrimination, transparency, human rights, empowerment and rule of law, which can be integrated into policymaking and implementation as part of transforming the food system (FAO, 2013; Caron et al., 2018; Toussaint and Martínez Blanco, 2020). The right to well-being can serve as the overarching umbrella of HRBA to addressing climate change within food systems and includes a right to health, right to food, cultural rights, the rights of the child and the right to healthy environment (Swinburn et al., 2019). An HRBA has a specific focus on those groups who are vulnerable due to poverty, discrimination and historical inequities and involves meaningful participation of vulnerable groups in governance, design and implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies, including gender responsiveness and integration of Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge (UNHRC 2017; Caron et al., 2018; Mills, 2018). There can be conflicts and trade-offs, such as between addressing land rights or traditional fishing grounds, the right to food, and addressing climate justice concerns (Mills, 2018; Borras et al., 2020; Section 5.13). Adaptation strategies that incorporate HRBA include legislation, programmes that address gender inequities in agriculture, agroecology, recognition of rights to land, fishing areas and other natural resources, protection of culturally significant seeds, and community-based adaptation that explicitly involves marginalised groups in governance (Mills, 2018; Tramel, 2018; Huyer et al., 2019; Borras et al., 2020; Section 5.1 4).
