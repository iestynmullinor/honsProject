Current projections indicate that it is highly likely  that the UN SDG2 (‘Zero Hunger’) by 2030 will not be achieved, with climate impacts on one of several drivers of food security and nutrition preventing this goal, including in Africa, Small Island States and South Asia (high confidence)  (FAO et al., 2018; Otekunrin et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2019; Atukunda et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2021; Vogliano et al., 2021). Integrated policy strategies that consider synergies and trade-offs between different food system components would strengthen the likelihood of meeting SDG2 goals (Dyngeland et al., 2020; Lipper et al., 2020; Vogliano et al., 2021) (Grosso et al., 2020). Adaptation options which address climate risks for food security and nutrition are discussed below.
