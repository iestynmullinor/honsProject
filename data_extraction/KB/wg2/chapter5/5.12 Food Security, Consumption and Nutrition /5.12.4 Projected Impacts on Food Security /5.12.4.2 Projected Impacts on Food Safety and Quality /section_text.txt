Increasing levels of CO2 directly contribute to reduced food quality by reducing levels of protein, iron, zinc and some vitamins, varying by crop species and cultivars (high confidence) (Section 5.4.3, Myers et al., 2014; Smith and Haddad, 2015; Bisbis et al., 2018; Scheelbeek et al., 2018; Weyant et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018a). Higher levels of CO2 are predicted to lead to 5â€“10% reductions in a wide range of minerals and nutrients (Loladze, 2014). Climate warming will also reduce food quality of seafood, by changing the LC-PUFA content in phytoplankton (Section 5.8; Hixson and Arts, 2016).
