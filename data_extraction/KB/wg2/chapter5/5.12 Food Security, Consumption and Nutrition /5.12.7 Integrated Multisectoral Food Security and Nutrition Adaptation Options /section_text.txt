Integrated multi-sectoral strategies that incorporate social protection are effective adaptation responses (high confidence) (Gros et al., 2019; Ulrichs et al., 2019; Medina Hidalgo et al., 2020; Daron et al., 2021; Ilboudo Nébié et al., 2021; Verschuur et al., 2021; 7.4.2, Cross-Chapter Box-GENDER in Chapter 18). Social protection programmes, such as cash transfers, weather index insurance and asset-building activities such as well construction, can support short-term responses to acute food insecurity in response to extreme events but can also build adaptive capacity longer term (Table 5.16, Costella et al., 2017; Ulrichs et al., 2019). An assessment of an adaptive social protection programme in the Sahel found that tailored seasonal forecasting can improve responsiveness to climate-related extreme events, but investment in capacity building and dialogue between forecasters, community groups and humanitarian organisations is needed (Daron et al., 2021). Forecast-based financing, which automatically disperses funds when threshold forecasts are reached for an extreme event (Coughlan de Perez et al., 2016), used in Bangladesh prior to a 2017 flood event allowed low-income, flood-prone communities to access better-quality food in the short term without accruing debt (Gros et al., 2019).Differentiated responses based on food security level and climate risk can be effective. A study of drought impacts on food security in Senegal between 1997 and 2016 recommended different adaptation strategies based on whether the region was a higher risk of acute short-term food insecurity and/or faced higher risk of drought (Table 5.16; Ilboudo Nébié et al., 2021). Given identified linkages between higher temperatures and extreme events with declines in child dietary diversity, safeguarding diverse diets is one important adaptation priority (Niles et al., 2021). Humanitarian responses are appropriate for short-term acute hunger, while in the medium term, home-grown school feeding programmes with diverse foods can support child nutrition and learning, and with local procurement can also increase income and food security of smallholder farmers (Ilboudo Nébié et al., 2021). Farmer associations can manage regional staple food storehouses, in which farmers store their harvest and receive credit, and can sell their harvest later in the season and pay back the credit with interest, strengthening local supplies and farmer income (Ilboudo Nébié et al., 2021).A study in Lesotho examined the extent to which climate change increased the likelihood of an acute drought in 2007, and a related food crisis (Verschuur et al., 2021). Given land degradation, reliance on rainfed agriculture and food imports from neighbouring South Africa, the study recommended crop diversification, increased use of drought tolerant crop varieties and expanded trade partners in the medium to long term, to both strengthen regional food production and reduce risk of crop failure and the likelihood of climate-induced drought from trade partners reducing food imports (Verschuur et al., 2021). A longitudinal study of smallholder coffee farmers in Nicaragua found that crop diversification, alongside crop management and varietal improvement, would help farmers strengthen food security long term in the face of climate hazards such as drought and coffee leaf rust (Bacon et al., 2021). Another medium- to long-term adaptation response is to address systemic gender, land tenure and other social inequities as part of an inclusive approach (Bezner Kerr et al., 2019; Khatri-Chhetri et al., 2020; Bacon et al., 2021). This long-term strategy could be part of a human-rights-based approach (HRBA, 5.12.8)
