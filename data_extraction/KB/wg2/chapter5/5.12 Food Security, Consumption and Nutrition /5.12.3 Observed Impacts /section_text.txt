Climate change has already changed the start and duration of the growing season and increased variability of rainfall in some places, with impacts on food intake and nutritional status and income for low-income and small-scale producers (medium evidence, high agreement , (FAO et al., 2018; Cooper et al., 2019). Evidence to date suggests that climate change has negative impacts on the stability of food supply over the medium to long term, thereby affecting food stability (Myers et al., 2017b). Increasing number and intensity of adverse weather events, driven by climate change (Seneviratne et al., 2021), are important factors decreasing food stability, through reduced availability, increased local price volatility, reduced livelihoods for food producers and disruption to food transport (Toufique and Belton, 2014; Verma et al., 2014; Ruiz Meza, 2015; Clay et al., 2018; FAO et al., 2018; Mbow et al., 2019).
