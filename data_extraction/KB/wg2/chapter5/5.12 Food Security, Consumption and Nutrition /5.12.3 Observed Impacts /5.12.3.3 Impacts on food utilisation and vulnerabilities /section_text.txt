Food utilisation refers to the way the body most effectively uses food, and includes food preparation, food quality and intra-household distribution. Food utilisation is affected by climate change in several ways: food safety, dietary diversity and food quality (Aberman and Tirado, 2014).Climate change have increased food safety risks (high confidence), including foodborne zoonotic animal diseases (5.5), and marine toxins from HABs (Sections 5.8, 5.9) and mycotoxins (Section 5.11). Other foodborne and waterborne infectious diseases such as cholera are further covered in Chapter 7.Weather variability and extreme events (Seneviratne et al., 2021) have reduced availability and access to diverse foods to sell and to purchase in rural markets, thereby reducing access to affordable, diverse foods for both rural small-scale producers and net consumers, particularly for landlocked and low-income countries (high confidence) (Pant et al., 2014; Villasante et al., 2015; Alston and Akhter, 2016; FAO et al., 2018; Park et al., 2019; Niles et al., 2021) and otherwise marginalised communities (Algur et al., 2021). One study of 87 countries and 150 extreme events estimated that low-income food deficit and landlocked countries had reduced nutrient supply ranging from −1.6 to −7.6% of average supply, a significant portion of a healthy child’s average dietary intake (Park et al., 2019).Rural children in low-income countries are at particular risk of undernutrition from climate change impacts, due to a combination of factors: potential reduction in food quantity and quality from heat impacts; greater exposure from outdoor play and agricultural activities; and increased likelihood of heat exhaustion and vector-borne and diarrheal diseases (Oppenheimer and Anttila-Hughes, 2016). A study of child growth data in 30 countries in Africa between 1993 and 2012 found that increased temperature was significantly related to children’s wasting (Baker and Anttila-Hughes, 2020). Another study examined 30 years of climate data and child dietary diversity outcomes in 19 countries, and found that higher-than-average annual temperatures correlated with declines in child diet diversity at levels equal to or greater than other factors which often are the focus of policy, such as market access or education (Niles et al., 2021).
