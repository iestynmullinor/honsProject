Increased extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods and tropical storms; Seneviratne et al., 2021) due to climate change are key drivers of recent rises in food insecurity rates and severe food crises in some regions (high confidence) (Section 5.4.1, Yeni and Alpas, 2017; FAO et al., 2018; Cooper et al., 2019; Baker and Anttila-Hughes, 2020; Bogdanova et al., 2021; Ilboudo Nébié et al., 2021). Extreme weather events reduce physical and economic access to food, increase food prices, and compound underlying conditions of food insecurity and malnutrition such as low access to diverse healthy foods and safe water (FAO et al., 2018; Niles et al., 2021). Increased incidence of severe drought conditions since 2005 is contributing to food insecurity in affected regions, including Africa, Asia and the Pacific (Chapter 7, Phalkey et al., 2015; FAO et al., 2018; Cooper et al., 2019; Ilboudo Nébié et al., 2021; Verschuur et al., 2021;). In Arctic western Siberia, high temperatures, melting ice and forest and tundra fires have degraded reindeer pastures; Indigenous Peoples have reduced traditional diets and increased purchased food with increases in hypertension and related health impacts (Bogdanova et al., 2021).There is growing evidence that anthropogenic climate warming has already intensified climate extreme events induced by large-scale SST oscillations such as ENSO (Herring et al., 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2021). For example, the 2015–2016 El Niño, the strongest in the past 145 years, induced severe droughts in Southeast Asia and eastern and southern Africa, some intensified by anthropogenic warming (Funk et al., 2018). As a result, 20.5 million people faced acute food insecurity in 2016 (FSIN, 2017) and an estimated additional 5.9 million children became underweight (Anttila-Hughes et al., 2021).Weather extreme events increased food prices and food price volatility (Peri, 2017), thereby worsening food insecurity (Shiferaw et al., 2014; Bene et al., 2015; Miyan, 2015; FAO et al., 2018; Ilboudo Nébié et al., 2021). Rising food prices can affect conflict, political instability and migration (Bush and Martiniello, 2017), but the relationship between climate change, political instability and conflict is often mediated by other underlying factors such as poor governance (Chapter 7.2.7, Mach et al., 2019; Selby, 2019).Low-income urban and rural households who are net food buyers are particularly affected by food price increases, with reduction in consumption of diverse food groups (high confidence) (Green et al., 2013; Villasante et al., 2015; FAO et al., 2018). Depending on the context, particular groups, including women, ethnic and religious minorities, will be more vulnerable to worsening food insecurity from climate change impacts (Clay et al., 2018; Jantarasami et al., 2018; Nature climate change Editorials, 2019; Algur et al., 2021 and see Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18). Indigenous Peoples are often more vulnerable to climate change, due to conditions of poverty, limited resources, discrimination and marginalisation (high confidence) (Smith and Rhiney, 2016; Vinyeta et al., 2016; Jantarasami et al., 2018). Indigenous Peoples may experience loss of culturally significant foods and declining traditional ecological knowledge (Dounias and Ichikawa, 2017; Ross and Mason, 2020; 5.7).
