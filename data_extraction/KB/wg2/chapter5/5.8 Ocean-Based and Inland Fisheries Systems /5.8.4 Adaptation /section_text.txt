Adaptation options in land- and aquatic-based culturing food production systems include both governance actions and changes in the factors of production (Section 5.4.4, 5.5.4, Reverter et al., 2020). In contrast, adaptation options in fisheries are primarily concentrated in the socioeconomic dimension, especially governance and management (Brander et al., 2018; Holsman et al., 2019), and given the scale of the problem, there are relatively few intentional, well-documented examples of implemented tactical responses (Bell et al., 2020).The proportion of fisheries operating at levels that are considered biologically unsustainable by the FAO has increased from 10% in 1974 to 34.2% in 2017 (FAO, 2020d). There is high confidence that reducing stresses on marine ecosystems reduces vulnerability to climate change and augments resilience (Barange, 2019; Woodworth-Jefcoats et al., 2019; Ogier et al., 2020). Specifically, overfishing is the most critical non-climatic driver affecting the sustainability of fisheries, and therefore improving management could help rebuild fish stocks, reduce ecosystem impacts and increase the adaptive capacity of fishing (high confidence); (Barange, 2019; Das et al., 2020). Pursuing sustainable fisheries practices under a low-emissions scenario would decrease risk by 63%; in contrast, under the most extreme RCP8.5, both profit and harvest decline relative to today even under the most optimistic assumptions about global fisheries management reforms (Gaines et al., 2018; Sumaila et al., 2019; Free et al., 2020).One adaptation strategy in the fishing sector is developing the capacity to recognise and respond to new opportunities that might arise from climate change by establishing a policy and planning setting that augments the fishers’ flexibility to change target species of fisheries or even engage in different productive activities. A key element would be the design and implementation of management schemes that consider flexible permits, sharing quotas, rethinking boundaries and reference points in response to system changes (Brander et al., 2018; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter). Large-scale distribution and productivity changes of commercial fish species will demand the ability to implement cooperative fishing strategies (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2020; Østhagen et al., 2020), and adjust multi-lateral treaties and other legal instruments used for managing shared transboundary ecosystems (Butler et al., 2019; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter).There is high confidence that making climate change and adaptive capacity a mainstream consideration in global, regional, environmental and fisheries governance structures can improve the response capacity to ocean change (Gaines et al., 2018; Bindoff et al., 2019; Holsman et al., 2020; Ojea et al., 2020). For example, spatial management that includes strategies such as Territorial Use Rights for Fishing (TURFs), locally managed marine areas (LMMAs) and customary tenure is an approach that has climate change adaptation potential in small-scale fisheries but will require adjustments in governing and managing institutions that allow them to be more dynamic and flexible (Le Cornu et al., 2018). In regions where some of these measures have already been tested, institutional, legal, financial and logistical barriers to successful adaptation have been encountered, such as market failures stemming from uncertainty around new or emerging species, or policy barriers derived from the fact that the creation of scientific information needed to change regulations is likely slower than the pace of changes in stocks (Peck and Pinnegar, 2018).Adaptation capacity is limited by the financial capacity of some countries (Bindoff et al., 2019). For example, in West African fisheries, adaptation costs associated with replacing the loss of coastal ecosystems and productivity is estimated to require 5–10% of countries’ GDP (Zougmoré et al., 2016). For Pacific Islands and Coastal Territories, fisheries adaptation will require significant investment from local governments and the private sector (Rosegrant et al., 2016), and reducing dependence on or finding alternatives to vulnerable marine resources (Johnson et al., 2020; Mabe and Asase, 2020).Adaptive capacity is strongly associated with social capital (i.e., the networks, shared norms, values and understandings that facilitate cooperation within or among groups) (high confidence) (Stoeckl et al., 2017; D’agata et al., 2020) and depends on to what extent stakeholders are aware of climate change and their perception of risk (Ankrah, 2018; Martins and Gasalla, 2018; Chen, 2020). Improving information flows allows for a more efficient co-management implementation (medium confidence) (Vasconcelos et al., 2020). Utilisation of local and Indigenous knowledge has the potential to facilitate adaptation (Bindoff et al., 2019), not only because it represents actual experiences and autonomous adaptations, but also because it facilitates reaching shared understanding among stakeholders and adoption of solutions. Challenges to hybridising local ecological knowledge and scientific knowledge include differences in stakeholder or governance perceptions about the validity of each knowledge set and issues of expertise and trust (Harrison et al., 2018). Engaging Indigenous Peoples and local communities as partners across climate research ensures this knowledge is utilised, enhancing the usefulness of assessments (Bindoff et al., 2019) and facilitating the co-construction and implementation of sustainable solutions (medium confidence) (Braga et al., 2020; Bulengela et al., 2020). Building climate resilience in the fishing sector also involves recognising gender and other social inequities (Call and Sellers, 2019), and ensuring that all stakeholders are equally involved in the adaptation plans, including their design and the capacity-building training programmes.There is high confidence that, for the freshwater fisheries systems, the most immediate adaptation option is the effective linkage of fisheries management to the adaptation plans of other sectors, especially water management (hydropower, irrigation and the commitment to maintaining environmental flows) (Harrod et al., 2018a; Kao et al., 2020). In some regions, organisations are already addressing this issue; for example, The Office of Water (OW) in the USA is aimed at ensuring that drinking water is safe while ecosystem is conserved to provide healthy habitat for fish, plants and wildlife; however, success strongly depends on the possibility of integrating the jurisdictional framework of different agencies (Poesch et al., 2016), the implementation of effective monitoring programmes (Paukert et al., 2016) and finding ways to incentivise the early restoration of degraded systems (Ranjan, 2020).
