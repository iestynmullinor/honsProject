Möllmann (Germany)This Cross-Chapter Box, the ‘moving plate’, addresses climate-induced shifts and domesticated production suitability of food species consumed by people. Marine, freshwater and terrestrial systems are already experiencing species shifts in response to climate change (very high confidence) (see also Sections 2.4.2.1. and 3.4.3., Figure MOVING PLATE.1 this chapter), with subsequent impacts on food provisioning services, pests and diseases (high confidence) (see Box 5.8 and Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2). This Box highlights food insecurity and malnutrition of vulnerable peoples under climate change for both wild and domesticated aquatic and terrestrial species, and discusses challenges for adaptation and the roles that management (transboundary and ecosystem-based) can play to enable food security, reduce conflicts and prevent resource over-extraction.Range contractions, shifts or extirpations are projected for terrestrial and aquatic species under warming, with greater warming leading to larger shifts and losses, where mitigation would therefore benefit climate refugia and reduce projected biodiversity declines (Smith et al., 2018; Warren et al., 2018). Marine species are moving poleward faster than terrestrial and freshwater species, despite faster warming on land (Pecl et al., 2017; Lenoir et al., 2019; Woolway and Maberly, 2020), leading to new or exacerbated socioeconomic conflicts within and between countries (see Figure MOVING PLATE.1 this chapter, see Sections 13.5.2.2., 15.3.4.4., FAQ 15.3., Mendenhall et al., 2020). There is large variation in the magnitude and pattern of species shifts, even among similar species within a region, leading to changes in communities in a given region (Brown et al., 2016; Pecl et al., 2017). The number of extreme heat stress days are projected to increase for domesticated species like cattle (see Figure MOVING PLATE.1 this chapter), leading to shifts in suitable habitat for raising livestock in the open with associated impacts in animal productivity and the costs of adapting in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America (Thornton et al., 2021).Nutritional dependency, cultural importance, livelihood, or economic reliance on shifting species will increase impacts of climate change, especially for small-scale fishers (marine and freshwater), farmers, women and communities highly dependent on local sources of food and nutrition (high confidence) (see Figures MOVING PLATE.1 and MOVING PLATE.3 this chapter, Sections 3.5.3., 8.2.1.2. and 15.3.4.4, McIntyre et al., 2016; Blasiak et al., 2017; Kifani et al., 2018; Bindoff et al., 2019; Atindana et al., 2020; Hasselberg et al., 2020; Farmery et al., 2021). Micronutrient concentrations from marine fisheries vary with species, providing higher concentrations of calcium, iron and zinc in tropical regions and higher concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids in polar regions (Hicks et al., 2019). While consumption of smaller species rich in micronutrients may provide significant benefits against deficiencies in Asia and Africa, local dietary changes in fish consumption may be linked to food preferences, fish availability due to international trade or illegal fishing and competing usage of fish (see Figure MOVING PLATE.3 this chapter, Hicks et al., 2019; Sumaila et al., 2020; Vianna et al., 2020). Industrial fleets are likely to switch target species (Belhabib et al., 2016) and inhibit small-scale fishers via illegal, unreported or unregulated fishing in EEZs (Belhabib et al., 2019; Belhabib et al., 2020). Extreme events can exacerbate issues, as fisheries are frequently increasingly exploited as a coping mechanism under times of crisis, increasing illegal fishing activities and conflict among maritime users (Pomeroy et al., 2016; Mazaris and Germond, 2018). Spatial conflicts between artisanal and commercial foreign fishing fleets are already occurring in Ghana (Penney et al., 2017), and from climate-induced tropical tuna shifts in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Islands (see Section 15.3.4.4., (Bell et al., 2018 a)). Properly managed small-scale fisheries can reduce poverty and improve localised food security and nutrition in low-income countries but will likely require restriction in the number of fishers, boat size or fishing days (Purcell and Pomeroy, 2015; Hicks et al., 2019).Shifting species have negative implications for the equitable distribution of food provisioning services, increasing the complexity of resolving sovereignty claims and climate justice (high confidence) (Allison and Bassett, 2015; Ayers et al., 2018; Baudron et al.; Ojea et al., 2020; Palacios-Abrantes et al., 2020). Higher-latitude countries generally have higher GHG emissions and will benefit from poleward-migrating resources from tropical poorer and lower-emitting GHG countries (Free et al., 2020). In this context, climate justice supporting fishing arrangements could offset socioeconomic impacts from exiting species (Mills, 2018; Lam et al., 2020) and have negative implications particularly for small-scale operators (Farmery et al., 2021), However, considerations of climate justice have not been used by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) allocation shares to date (Engler, 2020). Species shifting from one historical jurisdiction to another may result in an incentivised depletion of the resource by the country the stock is shifting away from; reforming management to allocate resource sharing of quotas and permits or stock-unrelated side payments in bilateral or multilateral cooperative agreements may compensate or prevent loss (Diekert and Nieminen, 2017; Free et al., 2020; Ojea et al., 2020; Østhagen et al., 2020; Cross-Chapter Paper Polar 6.2.).Strong governance, ecosystem-based and transboundary management are considered fundamental to ameliorate the impacts of climate change (high confidence) but may be limited in effectiveness by the magnitude of change projected under low or no mitigation scenarios (see Sections 2.6.2., 14.4.2.2. and 15.3.4.4., Harrod et al., 2018c; Pinsky et al., 2018; Holsman et al., 2020; Ojea et al., 2020). Flexible and rapid policy reform and management adaptation will help to meet sustainability targets (Nguyen et al., 2016; Pentz and Klenk, 2020), and may only be available for countries with the scientific, technical and institutional capacity to implement these (high confidence) (Peck and Pinnegar, 2018; Figures MOVING PLATE.2 and 3 this chapter). Other adaptation options include ‘follow the food’ thereby migrating further (Belhabib et al., 2016), provision of alternative livelihoods (Thiault et al., 2019; Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7, Free et al., 2020), increasing ecosystem resilience by rebuilding coastal mangroves (Tanner et al., 2014; and Box 1.3) and riparian areas of freshwater ecosystems (Mantyka-Pringle et al., 2016) and autonomous adaptations, such as harvesting gear modifications to access new target species (Harrod et al., 2018c; Kifani et al., 2018), practice change, and early-warning systems (see Section 11.3.2.3; Pecl et al., 2019; Melbourne-Thomas et al., 2021). Adaptive capacity will change with country, region, scale (commercial, recreational, Indigenous) of fishery, jurisdiction, and resource dependence (see Figure MOVING PLATE.2 this chapter for adaptation options for marine, freshwater and terrestrial systems). While shifting fishing fleets or herding may be an adaptation option to follow resources, limits to feasibility include institutional, legal, financial and logistical barriers such as costs of sourcing food and operational economic viability (Belhabib et al., 2016); this could potentially lead to maladaptation through increased GHG emissions from fuel usage and cultural displacement from traditional fishing and herding lands. Overall, decreases in GHG emissions under future scenarios would reduce increases in global temperatures and limit species shifts, thereby lowering the likelihood of conflicts and food insecurity (high confidence).Cross-Chapter Box: MOVING PLATECoastal Regions of the Gulf of Guinea: Ghanian FisheriesMarine fisheries in Ghana are dominated by artisanal fishers with overfished stocks, high nutritional fish dependency, high illegal fishing, low governance capacity (−0.21 2018, (World Bank, 2019)) and low climate awareness in regional fisheries management (Figure MOVING PLATE.3 this chapter; see Chapter 9; Nunoo et al., 2014; Belhabib et al., 2015; Belhabib et al., 2016; Kifani et al., 2018; Belhabib et al., 2019). Artisanal fishing plays a pivotal role in reducing poverty and food insecurity, and the impacts of climate change will risk developing poverty traps (see Section 8.4.5.6., (Kifani et al., 2018)). Climate change induced species redistribution is a large risk to Ghanian fisheries, with projections of over 20 commercial fish species exiting the region with no new species entering under RCP4.5 by 2100 (Oremus et al., 2020), and has already seen increases in warmer-water species with declining stocks. Adaptation options being applied are extending fishing ranges, increasing fishing effort (and cost) to access declining fish (with government fuel incentives) (Kifani et al., 2018; Muringai et al., 2021), developing aquaculture for alternative livelihoods, implementing fleet monitoring to reduce illegal fishing, and developing a robust Fisheries Information and Management System that accounts for environmental and climate drivers (Johnson et al., 2014; FAO, 2016; Kassi et al., 2018). However, fisheries remain insufficiently regulated, there is a lack of a skilled workforce, and there is low access to credit; collectively, these factors limit options for artisanal fishers to find alternative sustainable employment (FAO, 2016).Shifting Distributions of Freshwater Fishery Resources: Knowledge GapsFreshwater fisheries provide the primary source of animal protein and essential micronutrients for an estimated 200 million people globally and are especially important in tropical developing nations (see Section 9.8, Lynch et al., 2017; Funge-Smith and Bennett, 2019.). There is evidence that freshwater fishes have undergone climate-induced distribution shifts (Comte and Grenouillet, 2015; see Section 9.8.5.1.), and further shifts are projected as water temperatures rise and hydrological regimes change, with the largest effects predicted for equatorial, subtropical and semi-arid regions (Barbarossa et al., 2021). Currently, the effects of distribution shifts on local fishery catch potential, food security and/or nutrition have not been quantified for any major inland fishery, representing a key knowledge gap for anticipating future adaptation needs for freshwater fishing societies. However, studies on fishers’ perceptions of climate-induced changes in fishery catch rates have revealed that using local knowledge to adjust management practices (see Chapter 12 Central and South America this volume; Oviedo et al., 2016) and shifting gears, fishing grounds and target species (see Section 9.8.5.3.; Musinguzi et al., 2016) can be effective adaptation options.Terrestrial Species ShiftsThere is robust evidence of shifts that terrestrial species have shifted poleward in high latitudes, with general declines of sea-ice dependent as well as some extreme-polar-adapted species (high confidence) (Arctic and Siberian Tundra, see Section 2.4.2.2., Cross-Chapter Paper 6), with often deleterious effects on the food security and traditional knowledge systems of Indigenous societies (Horstkotte et al., 2017; Pecl et al., 2017; Mallory and Boyce, 2018; Forbes et al., 2020). Recent decades have seen declines in Arctic reindeer and caribou (see Section 2.5.1., Cross-Chapter Paper 6), and adaptation responses include utilisation of Indigenous knowledge with scientific sampling to maintain traditional management practices (Pecl et al., 2017; Barber et al.; Forbes et al., 2020). Preserving herder livelihoods will necessitate novel solutions (supplementary feeding, seasonal movements), where governance, ecological and socioeconomic trade-offs will be balanced at the local level (Horstkotte et al., 2017; Pecl et al., 2017; Mallory and Boyce, 2018; Forbes et al., 2020). Wild meat consumption plays a critical, though not well understood, role in the diets and food security of several hundred million people (medium evidence), for example in lower latitudes such as Central Africa and the Amazon basin (Bharucha and Pretty, 2010; Godfray et al., 2010; Nasi et al., 2011; Friant et al., 2020). Although illegal in many countries, wild meat hunting occurs either in places where there is no or limited domesticated livestock production, or in places where shock events such as droughts and floods threaten food supply, forcing increased reliance on wild foods including bush meat (Mosberg and Eriksen, 2015; Bodmer et al., 2018). Appropriate management of wild meat for reliant peoples under projected climate change will necessitate incorporating social justice elements into conservation and public health strategies (see Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2, Cross-Chapter Box COVID in Chapter 7, Friant et al., 2020; Ingram, 2020; Pelling et al., 2021).Figure Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE.1 | Global vulnerabilities to current and projected climate change for living marine resources and cattle.  (a)  Ocean areas are delineated into FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations) regions. Ocean sensitivity is calculated from aggregated sensitivities from Blasiak et al. (2017) S1 country data based on number of fishers, fisheries exports, proportions of economically active population working as fishers, total fisheries landings and nutritional dependence, which was subsequently re-analysed for each FAO region depicted here. Arrows denote projected average commercial and artisanal fishing resource shifts in location under RCP2.6 and under RCP8.5 (dark-blue and red arrows, respectively) scenarios by 2100. Text boxes highlight examples of vulnerabilities (Bell et al., 2018 a), conflicts (Miller et al., 2013; Blasiak et al., 2017; Østhagen et al., 2020) or opportunities for marine resource usage (Robinson et al., 2015; Stuart-Smith et al., 2018; Meredith et al., 2019).

Arrows are shown only for sub-regions where >1 million additional animals are affected. Areas in green are those with >5000 animals per 0.5° grid cell in the eary 21st century (Thornton et al., 2021).Open figure Figure Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE.2 | Common adaptation options, limitations and potential for adaptation and maladaptation in aquatic and terrestrial species with climate-induced movement of food species and reliant peoples. Open figure Figure Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE.3 | Global documented fisheries adaptive capacity to climate change and regional seafood micronutrient deficiency risk. Ocean areas are delineated into FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations) regions. Fisheries management adaptive capacity is a function of: averaged GDP World Development Indicators for 2018 (World Bank, 2020); climate awareness assessments of 30 of the FAO recognised most recent RFMOs with direct fisheries linkages (see Supplementary Material SM5.5); governance effectiveness index based on six aggregate indicators (voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence/terrorism, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption) from 2018 World Governance Indicator (World Bank, 2019) data; and heterogeneity of countries within each FAO zone (highly heterogeneous regions are less likely to establish sustainable and efficient fisheries management for the entire FAO zone). Land area represents the percentage regional averaged seafood micronutrient deficiency risk of calcium, iron, zinc and vitamin A from 2011 data (Beal et al., 2017).Open figure In terrestrial, marine and freshwater systems, human populations already impacted by poverty and hunger experience greater risk under climate change. Future food security will depend on access to other sustainable sources either via transnational agreements or resource/livelihood diversification. Sudden shocks across food production systems (Cottrell et al., 2019) can lead to increases in fisheries harvest and wild meat consumption, and following food species may result in community relocations or disruption and loss of access to historical places of attachment (high confidence) (Pecl et al., 2017; Lenoir et al., 2019; Meredith et al., 2019; Melbourne-Thomas et al., 2021; see Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). Ecosystem-based management approaches exist for terrestrial, marine and freshwater systems, but have proved successful only with early engagement of local small-scale, subsistence fishers/harvesters, utilising Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge and needs, in addition to those of larger-scale operators (high confidence) (Huntington et al., 2015; McGrath and Costello, 2015; Huq and Stubbings, 2016; Huq et al., 2017; Raymond-Yakoubian et al., 2017; Nalau et al., 2018; Raymond-Yakoubian and Daniel, 2018; Pecl et al., 2019; Planque et al., 2019). Currently, there are large regional differences in climate literacy in RFMOs (Sumby et al., 2021) which, when combined with low governance and GDP per capita, will limit adaptation capacity and increase vulnerabilities, particularly for tropical and subtropical regions already at increased risk due to poleward species migrations (see Figure MOVING PLATE.3 this chapter). Trade will be an alternative to compensate for the moving plate but has specific risks that can amplify inequities and maladaptation (Asche et al., 2015; Vianna et al., 2020).Cross-Chapter Box: MOVING PLATE
