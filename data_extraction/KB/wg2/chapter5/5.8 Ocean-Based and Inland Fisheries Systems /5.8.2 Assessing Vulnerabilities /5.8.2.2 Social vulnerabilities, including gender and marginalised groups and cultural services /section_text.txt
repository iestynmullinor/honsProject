There is high confidence that climate change is and will continue to be a threat to the livelihood of millions of fishers, with the most vulnerable being those with fewer opportunities and less income (Barange and Cochrane, 2018; Section 3.4.3). The social vulnerability can differ largely between locations, even between relatively close coastal or inland communities (Bennett et al., 2014; Maina et al., 2016; Ndhlovu et al., 2017; Martins et al., 2019) and among inhabitants within a location, depending on factors such as access to other economic activities, education, health, adults in the household, and political connections (high confidence) (Senapati and Gupta, 2017; Abu Samah et al., 2019; Lowe et al., 2019).Indigenous coastal communities consume 1.5â€“2.8 million metric tonnes of fish per year (about 2% of global yearly commercial marine catch), and reach a per capita consumption estimated to be 15 times greater than that of non-Indigenous country populations (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2016). There is high confidence that some Indigenous fishing communities are particularly vulnerable to climate change through a reduced capacity to conduct traditional harvests because of limited access to, or availability of, fish resources (Weatherdon et al., 2016), with consequences that include dietary shifts with significant nutritional and health implications (Marushka et al., 2019), displacement and loss of cultural identity (Sullivan and Rosenberg, 2018) and loss of social, economic and cultural rights (Finkbeiner et al., 2018). Areas of high risk for Indigenous Peoples include the Arctic, coastal communities with a high dependency on marine and freshwater fisheries, and Small Island States and Territories (Finkbeiner et al., 2018; Hanich et al., 2018, Section CCP6.2.5.1).Women play a crucial role along the entire fisheries value chain, providing labour force in industrialised and small-scale fisheries all around the world (FAO, 2020d). For small-scale fisheries alone, women represent about 11% of the labour force, and their activity is generally in subsistence fisheries, highlighting their role in household food security (Harper et al., 2020). In general, gendered division of labour tends to cause lower salaries for women and different perception and experience of risk to climate change impacts (high confidence) (Lokuge and Hilhorst, 2017).
