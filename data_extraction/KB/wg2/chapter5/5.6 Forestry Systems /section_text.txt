Reducing Deforestation and Forest Degradation plus (REDD+) is a climate mitigation strategy which could also provide important climate change adaptation co-benefits; for example, sustainable forest management could provide long term livelihoods to local communities and enhance resilience to climate risks (Turnhout et al., 2017). However, major challenges related to REDD+ implementation and forest use remain such that it has not been implemented successfully at scale (Table 5.8).Table 5.8 | Challenges and solutions for REDD+Challenges with REDD+ implementationSolutions for successful forest management Legal: lack of carbon rights in national legislations (Sunderlin et al., 2018; RRI, 2018b); unclear forestland tenure systems (Resosudarmo et al., 2014).There is high confidence that implementing social safeguards such as a Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) is vital to adequately involving Indigenous Peoples and local communities in REDD+ (White, 2014; Raftopoulos and Short, 2019). Indigenous Peoples, consisting of at least 370 million people, manage or have tenure rights over a quarter of the world’s land surface (around 38 million km 2) encompassing about 40% of the world’s protected areas (Garnett et al., 2018; RRI, 2018a).Food security and livelihoods: negative impacts of REDD+ on food security, agroforestry and swidden agriculture (Fox et al., 2014; Holmes et al., 2017).There is high agreement  that REDD+ and other green adaptation and mitigation efforts need to cooperate with Indigenous Peoples and other local communities who depend on forest resources for their livelihoods and food security (Wallbott, 2014; Mccall, 2016; Brugnach et al., 2017; Vanclay, 2017; Garnett et al., 2018; Paneque-Galvez et al., 2018; Sunderlin et al., 2018; Schroeder and Gonzalez, 2019).Political and socio-cultural:  land acquisition or ‘green grabbing’ (Asiyanbi, 2016; Corbera et al., 2017); (mis)communicating the concept of carbon (Kent and Hannay, 2020); and lack of influence of Indigenous and local communities’ representation in global and national REDD+ negotiations (Wallbott, 2014; Dehm, 2016). In the absence of social and environmental safeguards, REDD+ could drive large-scale land acquisitions by states and corporations, resulting in global land grabs (or green grabbing), negatively affecting the food security, livelihoods and tenure rights of Indigenous and local communities (limited evidence, high agreement ) (Carter et al., 2017; Lund et al., 2017; Borras et al., 2020).There is low confidence as to whether community forestry is compatible with REDD+ (Hajjar et al., 2021). This is mainly due to lack of carbon payments and the variety of approaches to REDD+. There is high confidence that restoring land access and rights via transfer of formal land titles to Indigenous and local communities improves biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration.
