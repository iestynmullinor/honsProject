A wide range of measures exist to adapt sustainably managed forests of the boreal and temperate zone to climate change (Kolström et al., 2011; Gauthier et al., 2014; Keenan, 2015). Evidence emerging since the last assessment report further bolstered the notion that adapting the tree species composition to more warm-tolerant and less disturbance-prone species can significantly mitigate climate change impacts (high confidence) (Duveneck and Scheller, 2015; Seidl et al., 2018). Assisting the establishment of species in suitable habitats is one option to achieve climate-adapted tree species compositions (Benito-Garzón and Fernández-Manjarrés, 2015; Iverson et al., 2019). Furthermore, increasing the diversity of tree species within stands can have positive effects on tree growth and reduce disturbance impacts (high confidence) (Neuner et al., 2015; Jactel et al., 2018; Ammer, 2019). Some studies also suggest a positive effect of increased structural diversity, such as on forest resilience (moderate confidence) (Lafond et al., 2013; Koontz et al., 2020). Managing for continuous forest cover can also help to maintain the forest microclimate and buffer tree regeneration and the forest floor community against climate change (high confidence) (De Frenne et al., 2013; Zellweger et al., 2020). Reducing stocking levels, such as through thinning, has been found to effectively mitigate drought stress (Gebhardt et al., 2014; Elkin et al., 2015; Bottero et al., 2017), yet effects vary with species and ecological context (robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Sohn et al., 2016; Castagneri et al., 2021). Also shortened rotation periods have been suggested in response to climate-induced increases in growth and disturbance (Jönsson et al., 2015; Schelhaas et al., 2015). However, recent evidence suggests that these measures diminish in efficiency under climate change and can have corollary effects on other important forest functions such as carbon storage and habitat quality (medium confidence) (Zimová et al., 2020). Also, measures targeting landscape structure and composition have proven effective for increasing the climate resilience of forest systems (medium confidence) (Aquilue et al., 2020; Honkaniemi et al., 2020). While an increasing number of adaptation measures exist for sustainably managed forests, many studies highlight that the lead times for adaptation in forestry are long and that some vulnerabilities might remain also after adaptation measures have been implemented. Furthermore, the costs and benefits of adaptation measures relative to other goals of sustainable forest management, such as the conservation of biological diversity, have to be considered (Felton et al., 2016; Zimová et al., 2020; see Cross-Chapter Paper 7.5 Adaptation Response Options).
