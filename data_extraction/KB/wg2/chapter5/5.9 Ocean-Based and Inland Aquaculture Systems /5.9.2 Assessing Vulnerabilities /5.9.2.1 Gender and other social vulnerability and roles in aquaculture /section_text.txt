There are regional differences in women’s roles, responsibilities and involvement in adaptation strategies in the aquaculture sector. Women comprise 14% of the 2018 global aquaculture workforce of 20.5 million (FAO, 2020c), representing up to 42% of the salmon workforce in Chile (Chávez et al., 2019), predominantly in processing roles (Gopal et al., 2020). In the majority of lower-middle-income countries, seaweed culture is dominated by women in family-owned businesses as in Zanzibar and the Philippines (Brugere et al., 2020; Ramirez et al., 2020), where women are not always paid directly but contribute to family incomes (high confidence) (Msuya and Hurtado, 2017; Brugere et al., 2020; Ramirez et al., 2020). In India, women collect stocking juveniles and assist in pond construction; in Bangladesh, women do the same tasks as men; and in Ghana, women undertake post-harvest fishing activities (Lauria et al., 2018). Women employed in aquaculture cooperatives gained adaptive capacity, which reduced gender inequities (medium confidence) (Farquhar et al., 2018; Gonzal et al., 2019), but lack of financial access for women can create gender inequity at larger commercial scales (Gurung et al., 2016; Call and Sellers, 2019). Women in aquaculture experience competing roles between employment, childcare and home duties (high confidence) (Morgan et al., 2015; Lauria et al., 2018; Chávez et al., 2019; see Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18) and differ from men in terms of perceptions of environmental risk, climate change and adaptation behaviour, with limited contributions to decision making (medium confidence) (Barange and Cochrane, 2018). Therefore, effective climate aquaculture adaptation options need to address gender inequity, such as suitable technology designs that fit with social norms and access to credit to facilitate independent uptake (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Morgan et al., 2015; Oppenheimer et al., 2019). Generalised best practices for gender-sensitive approaches to adaptation are relevant for aquaculture (UNFCCC, 2013).
