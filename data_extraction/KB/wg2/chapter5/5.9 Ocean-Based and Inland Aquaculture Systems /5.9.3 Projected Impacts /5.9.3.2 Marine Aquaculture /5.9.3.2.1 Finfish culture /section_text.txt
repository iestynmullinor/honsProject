Global projections of ocean warming, primary productivity and ocean acidification predict suitable habitat expansions and short-term growth benefits for finfish aquaculture for some regions (medium confidence) (see Figure 5.15) until thermal tolerances or productivity constraints are exceeded by 2090 (Beveridge et al., 2018b; Dabbadie et al., 2018; Froehlich et al., 2018a; Catalán et al., 2019; Thiault et al., 2019; Falconer et al., 2020a). Sensitivities for marine finfish may be high even under +1.5–2.0°C (medium confidence) (Gattuso et al., 2018), resulting in finfish farms moving northward to maintain productivity (e.g., Arctic (Troell et al., 2017)). Downscaled projections of regionally specific tolerances (Klinger et al., 2017) may be particularly useful for management and planning; a 0.5°C rise is predicted for Chilean salmon aquaculture (Soto et al., 2019), and potential negative impacts on productivity in Norway by 2029 have been projected (limited evidence) (Falconer et al., 2020a). Marine heatwaves are predicted to increase in occurrence, intensity and persistence under RCP4.5 or RCP8.5 by 2100 (Oliver et al., 2019; Bricknell et al., 2021), with risk partly mitigated by husbandry (medium confidence) (McCoy et al., 2017). Generally, negative impacts are predicted for marine species, with residual risk increasing with level of exposure (Sara et al., 2018; Smale et al., 2019), where warming will affect oxygen solubility and reduce salmon culture capacity (limited evidence) (Aksnes et al., 2019, Chapter 3) and combine with increasing incidence of HABs (high confidence) resulting in negative impacts for food security and nutrition and health (Oppenheimer et al., 2019; Colombo et al., 2020; Glibert, 2020; Raven et al., 2020). Climate change is predicted to affect the incidence, magnitude and virulence of finfish disease such as Vibriosis (Barber et al., 2016; Mohamad et al., 2019a; Mohamad et al., 2019b), but specific host–pathogen–climate relationships are not yet established (high confidence) (Slenning, 2010; Marcogliese, 2016; Montanchez et al., 2019; Bandin and Souto, 2020; Behringer et al., 2020; Filipe et al., 2020; Montanchez and Kaberdin, 2020). Projected climate change will also increase competition for feed ingredients between aquatic and terrestrial animal production systems (see Section 5.13.2.).
