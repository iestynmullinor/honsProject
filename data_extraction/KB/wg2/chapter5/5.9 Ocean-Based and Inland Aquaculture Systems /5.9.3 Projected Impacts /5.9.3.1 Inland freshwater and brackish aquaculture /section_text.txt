Predicted sea level and temperature rise will result in coastal inundation into brackish and inland aquaculture systems (high confidence) (Mehvar et al., 2019; Nhung et al., 2019; Oppenheimer et al., 2019; Fox-Kemper et al., 2021), with negative impacts on aquaculture production in Viet Nam, East Africa and Jamaica (medium confidence) (Lebel et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2018; Bornemann et al., 2019). Precipitation and temperature changes will cause drought and flooding, negatively affecting near-shore fishpond productivity (limited evidence) (Canevari-Luzardo et al., 2019), but provide competitive advantages to non-native shrimp in Australia (limited evidence) (Cerato et al., 2019). Warming and acidification will increase HAB toxicity in freshwater systems, but responses may be strain-specific (Griffith and Gobler, 2020; Hennon and Dyhrman, 2020). As for molluscs in marine systems, projected climate change in freshwater and brackish systems may limit the availability of wild-sourced juveniles from fisheries (Beveridge et al., 2018). Projected impact studies for the inland and small-scale aquatic sectors are very limited (Halpern et al., 2019; Galappaththi et al., 2020b); therefore, this is a noted knowledge gap.
