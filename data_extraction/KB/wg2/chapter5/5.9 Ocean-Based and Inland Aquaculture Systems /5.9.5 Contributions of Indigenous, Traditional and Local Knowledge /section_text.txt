Indigenous mariculture practices, such as intertidal clam gardens, have been occurring for thousands of years, providing knowledge of traditional practices still applicable to mariculture (Deur et al., 2015; Jackley et al., 2016; Poulain et al., 2018; Bell et al., 2019; Toniello et al., 2019). Indigenous groups differ in opinions on aquaculture acceptability, implications for coastal management and territorial rights (high confidence) (Young et al., 2019). Such perceptions may determine culturally appropriate types and benefits of aquaculture (employment, food diversification, income, building autonomy and skillsets), such as in Australia (Petheram et al., 2013) and Canada (Young and Liston, 2010). Marginalised people, like small-scale aquaculture farmers in lower-income and lower-middle-income countries, are often overlooked and are not represented at a governance level (Barange et al., 2014; Kalikoski et al., 2018). Therefore policy, economic, knowledge and other support must ensure representation with traditional and other stakeholder ecological knowledge at national, regional and local levels to facilitate climate change adaptation and safeguard human rights for poor and vulnerable groups (high confidence) (Kalikoski et al., 2018; Poulain et al., 2018).
