Aquaculture is often viewed as an adaptation option for fisheries declines, thereby alleviating food security from losses of other climate change impacts (Sowman and Raemaekers, 2018; Johnson et al., 2020) such as Pacific Islands freshwater aquaculture, Bangladesh crop-aquaculture systems or Viet Nam rice–fish cultivations (Soto et al., 2018). Many adaptations are specific to regions, countries or sectors, implemented on a regional to national scale (FAO, 2018c; Galappaththi et al., 2020b). Adaptation likelihood (potential), effectiveness and risk of maladaptation was assessed per major FAO production region for inland, brackish and marine aquaculture (Figure 5.16) production systems. Potential adaptation measures to reduce production loss can be built upon existing adaptation planning and guidelines, to reduce the risk of maladaptation including feedback loops (e.g., FAO, 2015; Bueno and Soto, 2017; Dabbadie et al., 2018; FAO, 2018c; Poulain et al., 2018; Brugère et al., 2019; Pham et al., 2021; Soto et al., 2021). Large climate change adaptation strategies for the aquaculture sector exist, such as in the USA (Link et al., 2015), Australia (Hobday et al., 2017) and South Africa (Department of Environmental Affairs, 2016). Lower-income countries often lack financial, technical or institutional capacity for adaptation planning (Galappaththi et al., 2020b), but examples include Bangladesh and Myanmar (FAO, 2018c), with programmes offering adaptation funding (Dabbadie et al., 2018). Early participation of stakeholders in adaptive planning has promoted action and ownership of results (high confidence), such as in India and the USA (Link et al., 2015; FAO, 2018c; Soto et al., 2018) Early outreach, education and knowledge gap assessments raise awareness, where utilisation of local knowledge and Indigenous knowledge and scientific involvement support informed adaptive planning and uptake for all stakeholders (high confidence) (Cooley et al., 2016; FAO, 2018c; Rybråten et al., 2018; Soto et al., 2018; McDonald et al., 2019; Galappaththi et al., 2020b), as perceptions of climate risk and capacity will vary (Tiller and Richards, 2018). Supporting the active involvement of women helps address gender inequity and perceived risk, particularly for smallholder farmers (high confidence) (Morgan et al., 2015; Barange and Cochrane, 2018; FAO, 2018c; Avila-Forcada et al., 2020). However, regional and national political influences, financial and technical capacity, governance planning and policy development will ultimately support or hinder adaptation for aquaculture (high confidence) (Cooley et al., 2016; FAO, 2018c; Galappaththi et al., 2020b; Greenhill et al., 2020).Figure 5.16 | Assessment of the likelihood and effectiveness of a range of adaptation options for potential implementation in the near term (next decade) for inland freshwater and brackish aquaculture (salinities of <10 ppm and/or no connection to the marine environment)   (a)  and marine aquaculture systems (b)  per major FAO production zone.
