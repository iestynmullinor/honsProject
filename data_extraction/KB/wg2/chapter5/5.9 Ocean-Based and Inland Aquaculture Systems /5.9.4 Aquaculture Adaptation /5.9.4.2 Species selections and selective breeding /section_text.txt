Adaptation options at the operational level include species selections, such as cultivation of brackish species (shrimp, crabs) during dry seasons, and rice-finfish in wetter seasons in Thailand (Chiayarak et al., 2019), use of salt-tolerant plants in Viet Nam (Nhung et al., 2019; Paik et al., 2020), converting inundated rice paddies into aquaculture, rotating shrimp, and rice culture (high confidence) (Chiayarak et al., 2019). Species diversification through co-culture, integrated aquaculture–agriculture (e.g., rice–fish) or integrated multi-trophic culture (e.g., shrimp–tilapia–seaweed or finfish–bivalve–seaweed) may maintain farm long-term performance and viability by: creating new aquaculture opportunities; promoting societal and environmental stability; reducing GHG emissions through reduced feed usage and waste; and carbon sequestration (medium confidence) (see Section 5.10, Ahmed et al., 2017; Bunting et al., 2017; Gasco et al., 2018, Soto et al., 2018; Ahmed et al., 2019; Dubois et al., 2019; FAO, 2019c; Li et al., 2019; Freed et al., 2020; Galappaththi et al., 2020b; Prasko et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2020). In practice, most aquaculture operations concentrate on single-species systems (Metian et al., 2020), and barriers such as land availability, freshwater resources and lack of credit access may limit the uptake and success of integrated adaptation approaches to climate change (Ahmed et al., 2019; Tran et al., 2020; Kais and Islam, 2021).Selective breeding can promote climate resilience (medium confidence) (Klinger et al., 2017; Fitzer et al., 2019), and operations have already intentionally, or unintentionally, selected for production traits for changing conditions (de Melo et al., 2016; Tan and Zheng, 2020). Exposure of broodstock to future climate conditions may or may not confer advantages to offspring (moderate evidence, low agreement ) (Parker et al., 2015; Griffith and Gobler, 2017; Thomsen et al., 2017; Durland et al., 2019). Traditional pedigree developments require extensive phenotypic data, but genomic selections can rapidly select for robust climate-associated traits (Sae-Lim et al., 2017; Gutierrez et al., 2018; Zenger et al., 2018; Houston et al., 2020; Tan and Zheng, 2020). Genomic resources are available for salmon, rainbow trout, coho, carp, tilapia, seabass, bream, turbot, flounder, catfish, yellow drum, scallops, oysters and shrimp, but have been developed for disease and growth selections rather than climate resistance (Dégremont et al., 2015a; Dégremont et al., 2015b; Abdelrahman et al., 2017; Gjedrem and Rye, 2018; Gutierrez et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018a; FAO, 2019d; Houston et al., 2020), although bivalve selections for ocean acidification and warming resiliency are underway (Tan and Zheng, 2020). Targeted genome editing could modify phenotypes of major aquaculture species (Li et al., 2014 a; Elaswad et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2019; Houston et al., 2020), but uptake is dependent upon national regulatory and public approvals. Local adaptations within species with higher climate resiliencies may assist in selections (Thomsen et al., 2017; Falkenberg et al., 2019; Scanes et al., 2020; Toomey et al., 2020), but highlight the need to consider specific farming environments for selective processes (Houston et al., 2020). Projections of climate on aquaculture production traits are not well understood (Lhorente et al., 2019); therefore, genetic diversity needs to be maintained to ensure population fitness (high confidence) (Bitter et al., 2019; Lhorente et al., 2019; Visch et al., 2019; Houston et al., 2020; Mantri et al., 2020).
