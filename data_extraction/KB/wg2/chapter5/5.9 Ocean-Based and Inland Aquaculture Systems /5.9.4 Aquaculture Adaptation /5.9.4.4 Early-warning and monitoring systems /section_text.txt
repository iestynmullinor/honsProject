Globally, monitoring is increasing to fill scientific uncertainties (Goldsmith et al., 2019) but is not often at spatial scales which facilitate farm or regional adaptation management (Whitney et al., 2020) or data complexities prevent direct uptake by operators, resource managers and policymakers (medium confidence) (Soto et al., 2018; Gallo et al., 2019). Specialised industry portals (Pacific shellfish) and government-established monitoring programmes (Chilean salmon) and other observational networks (e.g., Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON)) can provide real-time monitoring and early-warning event alerts and facilitate aquaculture decision making (medium confidence) ( Cross et al., 2019; Farcy et al., 2019; Soto et al., 2019; Tilbrook et al., 2019; Bresnahan et al., 2020; Peck et al., 2020). Seasonal forecasting, downscaled models and early-warning systems provide valuable regional or farm site risk information (Hobday et al., 2018; Galappaththi et al., 2020b; Whitney et al., 2020), but monitoring will need to be useful for farmers, involve farmers, and be accurate, timely, cost-effective, reviewed and maintained in order to ensure uptake (high confidence) (Soto et al., 2018). Early-warning systems for HABs enable rapid decision making and risk mitigation (medium confidence), such as ocean colour monitoring in South Africa (Smith and Bernard, 2020), where early harvesting and additional husbandry were used to minimise production and economic losses (Pitcher et al., 2019). New tools, strategies and observations are needed to predict HAB occurrences and range shifts with changing climate (high confidence) (Schaefer et al., 2019; Tester et al., 2020), as there is uncertainty on drivers of incidence and toxicity (Wells et al., 2020).
