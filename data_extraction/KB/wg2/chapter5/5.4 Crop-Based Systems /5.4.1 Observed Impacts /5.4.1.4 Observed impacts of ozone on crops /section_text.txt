Tropospheric (i.e., the lowest 6–10 km of the atmosphere) ozone exacerbates negative impacts of climate change (high confidence) (Mattos et al., 2014; Chuwah et al., 2015; McGrath et al., 2015; Bisbis et al., 2018; Mills et al., 2018; Scheelbeek et al., 2018). Ozone is an air pollutant and short-lived GHG that affects air quality and global climate. It is a strong oxidant that reduces physiological functions, yield and quality of crops and animals. Surface ozone concentration has increased substantially since the late 19th century (Cooper et al., 2014; Forster et al., 2021; Gulev et al., 2021; Szopa et al., 2021) and in some locations and times reaches levels that harm plants, animals and human (high confidence) (Fleming et al., 2018).Mills (2018) estimated global distributions of current yield losses of major crops due to ozone, pest and diseases, heat, and aridity (Figure 5.4). Ozone-induced yield losses in 2010–2012 averaged 12.4%, 7.1%, 4.4% and 6.1% for soybean, wheat, rice and maize, respectively. Spatial variation in yield losses is similar among different stresses; areas with a large loss due to ozone are also at high risk of yield losses due to pest and diseases and heat. Many vegetable crops are also susceptible to ozone, which will adversely impact quality and quantity (Mattos et al., 2014; Bisbis et al., 2018; Scheelbeek et al., 2018).Figure 5.4 | The global effects of five biotic and abiotic stresses on soybean and wheat. All data are presented for the 1 × 1° (latitude and longitude) grid squares where the mean production of soybean or wheat was >500 tonnes (0.0005 Tg). The effect of each stress on yield is presented as a Yield Constraint Score (YCS) on a scale of 1–5, where 5 is the highest level of stress from ozone, pests and diseases, heat stress and aridity (Mills et al., 2018). Data are available at Sharps et al. (2020). See Annex I: Global to Regional Atlas for all four crops.Open figure The estimated yield loss does not account for interactions with other climatic factors. Temperatures enhance not only ozone production but also ozone uptake by plants, exacerbating yield and quality damage. Burney (2014) estimated current yield losses due to the combined effects of ozone and heat in India at 36% for wheat and 20% for rice. Schauberger et al. (2019a) found global yield losses, ranging from 2% to 10% for soybean and 0% to 39% for wheat with a model that accounts for temperature, water and CO2 concentration on ozone uptake.
