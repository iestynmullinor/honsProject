Elevated CO2 concentrations stimulate photosynthesis rates and biomass accumulation of C3 crops, and enhance crop water use efficiency of various crop species, including C4 crops (high confidence) (Kimball, 2016; Toreti et al., 2020). Perennial crops and root crops may have a greater capacity for enhanced biomass under elevated CO2 concentrations, although this does not always result in higher yields (Glenn et al., 2013; Kimball, 2016).Recent FACE studies found that the effects of elevated CO2 are greater under water-limited conditions (medium confidence) (Manderscheid et al., 2014; Fitzgerald et al., 2016; Kimball, 2016), which was generally reproduced by crop models (Deryng et al., 2016). However, drought sometimes negates the CO2 effects (Jin et al., 2018).There are significant interactions between CO2, temperature, cultivars, nitrogen and phosphorous nutrients (Kimball, 2016; Toreti et al., 2020): positive effects of rising CO2 on yield are significantly reduced by higher temperatures for soybean, wheat and rice (medium confidence) (Ruiz-Vera et al., 2013; Cai et al., 2016; Gray et al., 2016; Hasegawa et al., 2016; Obermeier et al., 2016; Purcell et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018). In above-ground vegetables, elevated CO2 can in some cases reduce the impact of other climate stressors, while in others the negative impacts of other abiotic factors negate the potential benefit of elevated CO2 (Bourgault et al., 2017; Bourgault et al., 2018; Parvin et al., 2018; Parvin et al., 2019). Significant variation exists among cultivars in yield response to elevated CO2, which is positively correlated with yield potential in rice and soybean, suggesting the potential to develop cultivars for enhanced productivity under future elevated [CO2] (Ainsworth and Long, 2021).Elevated CO2 reduces some important nutrients such as protein, iron, zinc and some grains, fruit or vegetables to varying degrees depending on crop species and cultivars (high confidence) (Mattos et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2018; Scheelbeek et al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2018a; Jin et al., 2019; Ujiie et al., 2019). This is of particular relevance for fruit and vegetable crops given their importance in human nutrition (high confidence) (see Section 5.12.4 for potential impacts on nutrition; Nelson et al., 2018; Springmann et al., 2018). Recent experimental studies (Section 5.3.2), however, show some complex and counteracting interactions between CO2 and temperature in wheat, soybean and rice; heat stress negates the adverse effect of elevated CO2 on some nutrient elements (Macabuhay et al., 2018; Kohler et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019b). The CO2 by temperature interaction for grain quality needs to be better understood quantitatively to predict food nutritional security in the future.
