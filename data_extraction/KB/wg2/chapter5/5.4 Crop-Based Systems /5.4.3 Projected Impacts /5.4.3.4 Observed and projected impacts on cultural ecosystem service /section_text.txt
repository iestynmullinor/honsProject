Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are those non-material benefits, such as aesthetic experiences, recreation, spiritual enrichment, social relations, cultural identity, knowledge and other values (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005), which support physical and mental health and human well-being (Chan et al., 2012; Triguero-Mas et al., 2015). CES in agricultural and wild landscapes include recreational activities, access to wild or cultivated products, and cultural foods, spiritual rituals, heritage and memory dimensions, and aesthetic experiences (Daugstad et al., 2006; Calvet-Mir et al., 2012; Ruoso et al., 2015). Relative to other ecosystem services, CES in agricultural landscapes have been less researched (Merlín-Uribe et al., 2012; Milcu et al., 2013; Bernues et al., 2014; Plieninger et al., 2014; van Berkel and Verburg, 2014; Ruoso et al., 2015; Quintas-Soriano et al., 2016). Agricultural heritage is a key aspect of CES and plays an important role in maintaining agrobiodiversity (Hanaček and Rodríguez-Labajos, 2018).Climate change is projected to have negative impacts on CES (medium confidence) (Table 5.4). There is limited evidence that climate change has been the main driver affecting CES of agroecosystems confounded by other drivers such as migration and changing farming patterns (Hanaček and Rodríguez-Labajos, 2018; Dhakal and Kattel, 2019). Recent studies observed declines in CES in alpine pastures and floodplains in Europe in part due to climate change impacts (Probstl-Haider et al., 2016; Schirpke et al., 2019). Another study estimated that the scenic beauty enjoyed by those who visit the vineyards in central Chile will decline by 18–28% by 2050 owing to a combination of reduced precipitation, increased temperatures and natural fire cycles (Martinez-Harms et al., 2017). More research is needed, however, particularly on cultural heritage and spiritually significant places and in low-income countries.Table 5.4 | Projected impacts on CES from climate change.RegionCESClimate change scenarioProjected impacts from climate changeReferencesCentral Chile, South AmericaAesthetic experience of scenic beauty in vine-growing region.RCP2.6 and 8.5.Increased temperature, reduced precipitation and increased fires will damage scenic beauty of vineyards.
