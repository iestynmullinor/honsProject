While those working with major crops have benefited from the release of new cultivars, those growing other crops are typically reliant on a heritage cultivars or landraces. While Indigenous knowledge and local smallholder knowledge and practices play an important role in supporting agrobiodiversity which provides genetic diversity resistant to climate-related stresses, a global and national focus in international research, subsidies and support for a few crop species has contributed to an overall decline in agrobiodiversity (FAO, 2019e; Song et al., 2019) Similarly, there is a lack of agronomic innovation and research to service ‘minor’ crops (Moriondo et al., 2015; Manners and van Etten, 2018). Even some high-value commodities grown outside high-income countries suffer from imbalances in the focus of available credit, research and innovation (Section 5.4.4.3; Glover, 2014; Fischer, 2016; Farrell et al., 2018). There is a possibility that a lack of adaptive capacity and policy support will drive these growers to move away from these diverse crops, further reducing the resilience of food systems by increasing risk of crop loss from pests, disease and drought and potential loss of Indigenous or local knowledge (Section 5.13.5, Table Box 5.1.1). In the Andean Altiplano of Bolivia, for example, Indigenous farmers have traditionally managed a diverse set of native crops which are drought and frost-tolerant, using cultural practices of seed selection and exchange, but have faced an increase in pests and diseases and a decline of traditional crops due to climate-change-related stresses, out-migration and intensification drivers (Meldrum et al., 2018).
