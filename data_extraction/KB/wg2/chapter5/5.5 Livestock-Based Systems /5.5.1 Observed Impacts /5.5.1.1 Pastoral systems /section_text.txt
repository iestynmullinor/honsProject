Many grassland-based livestock systems are vulnerable to climate change and increases in climate variability (high confidence) (Dasgupta et al., 2014; Sloat et al., 2018; Stanimirova et al., 2019). Decadal vegetation changes from warming and drying trends have been detected in North American grasslands, with implications for species composition, rangeland quality and economic viability of grazing livestock (Rondeau et al., 2018; Reeves et al., 2020). Feed quality in South Asian grasslands has been negatively affected, reducing food security (Rasul et al., 2019). Increased grassland degradation has been observed in parts of Inner Mongolia (Nandintsetseg et al., 2021). Changing seasonality, increasing frequency of drought and rising temperatures are affecting pastoral systems globally (high confidence). These and other drivers are reducing herd mobility, decreasing productivity, increasing incidence of vector borne diseases and parasites, and reducing access to water and feed (high agreement , medium evidence) (López-i-Gelats et al., 2016; Vidal-González and Nahhass, 2018; de Leeuw et al., 2020).
