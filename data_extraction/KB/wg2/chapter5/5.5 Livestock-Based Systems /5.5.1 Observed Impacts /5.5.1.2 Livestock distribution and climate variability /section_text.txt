There is limited evidence of observed distributional changes in livestock species due to climate changes. Asian buffalo and yak breeds in China over the past 50 years have shifted distribution partly because of increases in heat stress (Wu, 2015; Wu, 2016). Nepalese cattle numbers have declined, attributed to increases in the number of hot days (Koirala and Shrestha, 2017).Climate variability has been identified as the primary cause of vegetation cover changes on the Tibetan Plateau since 2000 (Lehnert et al., 2016). Increasing inter-annual variability is a driver of farm extensification in Mediterranean dairy systems (Dono et al., 2016). In Australian rangelands (Godde et al., 2019) and dairy systems (Harrison et al., 2016; Harrison et al., 2017), increasing rainfall variability contributes more to stocking rate and profitability variability than changes in mean rainfall.
