Climate change is affecting the transmission of vector-borne diseases (Hutter et al., 2018; Semenza and Suk, 2018) and parasites (Rinaldi et al., 2015) in high latitudes (high confidence). Different processes link climate change and infectious diseases in domesticated livestock. Some show a positive association between temperature and range expansion of arthropod vectors that spread the bluetongue virus. Others show a contraction, such as tsetse flies that transmit trypanosome parasites of several livestock species. Positive associations have been found between temperature and the spread of pathogens such as anthrax, and droughts and ENSO weather patterns and Rift Valley fever outbreaks in East Africa (Bett et al., 2017). Observed range expansion of economically important tick disease vectors in North America (Sonenshine, 2018) and Africa (Nyangiwe et al., 2018) are presenting new public health threats to humans and livestock.
