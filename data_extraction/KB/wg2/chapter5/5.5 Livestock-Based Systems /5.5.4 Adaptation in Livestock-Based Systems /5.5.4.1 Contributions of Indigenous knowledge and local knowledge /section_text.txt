Indigenous knowledge has a role to play in helping livestock keepers adapt (medium confidence), though the transferability of this knowledge is often unclear. Pastoralistsâ€™ local knowledge of climate and ecological change can complement scientific research (Klein et al., 2014), and local knowledge can be mobilised to inform adaptation decision making (Klenk et al., 2017). While Indigenous weather forecasting systems among pastoralists in Ethiopia (Balehegn et al., 2019; Iticha and Husen, 2019) and Uganda (Nkuba et al., 2020) are effective, synergies can be gained by combining traditional and modern knowledge to help pastoralists adapt. Sophisticated knowledge of feed resources among agro-pastoralists in West Africa is being used to increase system resilience (Naah and Braun, 2019). Understanding local knowledge for adaptation can present research challenges, for which new multi-disciplinary research methods may be needed (Reyes-Garcia et al., 2016; Roncoli et al., 2016). In particular, the complexities of knowledge, practice, power, local governance and politics need to be addressed (Hopping et al., 2016; Scoville-Simonds et al., 2020).
