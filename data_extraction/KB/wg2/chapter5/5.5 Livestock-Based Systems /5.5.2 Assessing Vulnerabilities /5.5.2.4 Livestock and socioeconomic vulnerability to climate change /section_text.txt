There is limited evidence about the role of livestock in addressing socioeconomic vulnerability. Although agriculture in parts of North America has become more sensitive to climate over the last 50 years, livestock have helped to moderate this effect, being less sensitive to increasing temperatures than some specialised crop systems (Ortiz-Bobea et al., 2018). Increasing frequency and severity of droughts will affect the future economic viability of grassland-based livestock production in the North American Great Plains (Briske et al., 2021). Purchasing more forage and selling more livestock have reduced household vulnerability in semi-arid parts of China over the last 35 years (Bai et al., 2019). A greater focus on sheep production away from cropping has increased the resilience of farming systems in Western Australia in low-rainfall years, although with mixed environmental effects (Ghahramani and Bowran, 2018). More insights are needed as to where and how livestock can affect the vulnerability of farmers and pastoralists.
