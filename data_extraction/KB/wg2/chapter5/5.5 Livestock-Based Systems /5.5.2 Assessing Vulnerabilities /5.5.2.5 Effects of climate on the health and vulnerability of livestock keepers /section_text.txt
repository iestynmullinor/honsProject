Vulnerability to the health impacts of climate change will be shaped by existing burdens of ill health and is expected to be highest in poor and socioeconomically marginalised populations (high agreement , limited evidence) (LabbÃ© et al., 2016). In addition to projected changes in infectious disease burdens, labour capacity in a warming climate is anticipated to decrease further, beyond the >5% drop estimated since 2000 (Watts et al., 2018). Loss of labour capacity may greatly increase the vulnerability of subsistence livestock keepers (high agreement , limited evidence).
