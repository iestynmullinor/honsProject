Vulnerability to climate change depends on demography and social roles (Mbow et al., 2019). Gender inequities can act as a risk multiplier, with women being more vulnerable than men to climate-change-induced food insecurity and related risks (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18). Women and men often have differential and unequal control over different productive assets and the benefits they provide, such as income from livestock (Ngigi et al., 2017; Musinguzi et al., 2018). Indigenous livestock keepers can be more vulnerable to climate change, partly due to ongoing processes of land fragmentation (Hobbs et al., 2008), historical land dispossession, discrimination and colonialisation, creating greater levels of poverty and marginalisation (Stephen, 2018). Adaptation actions may also be affected by gender and other social inequities (Balehey et al., 2018; Dressler et al., 2019). Men and women heads of household may access institutional support for adaptation in different ways (Assan et al., 2018). Further research is warranted to evaluate alternative gendered and equity-based approaches that can address differences in adaptive capacity within communities.
