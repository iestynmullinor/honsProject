Livestock production may account for 30% of all water (blue, green and grey) used in agriculture (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010) and can negatively affect water quality. Cropland feed production accounts for 38% of crop water consumption (Weindl et al., 2017). High-input livestock systems may consume more water than grazing or mixed systems, though water used per kg beef produced, for example, depends on country, context and system (Noya et al., 2019). In systems where feed production is rainfed, livestock and crop water productivity may be comparable (Haileslassie et al., 2009). Direct water consumption by livestock is <1–2% of global water consumption (Hejazi et al., 2014). Rising temperatures increase animal water needs, potentially affecting access of herders and livestock to drinking water sources (Flörke et al., 2018).
