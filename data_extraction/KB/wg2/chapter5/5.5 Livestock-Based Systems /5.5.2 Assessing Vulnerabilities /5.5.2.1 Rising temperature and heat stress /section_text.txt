Most domestic livestock have comfort zones in the range 10–30°C, depending on species and breed (Nardone et al., 2006). At higher temperatures, animals eat 3–5% less per additional degree of temperature, reducing their productivity and fertility. Heat stress suppresses the immune and endocrine system, enhancing susceptibility of the animal to disease (Das et al., 2016b). Recent stagnation in dairy production in West Africa and China may be associated with increased periods of high daily temperatures (low confidence) (Rahimi et al., 2020; Ranjitkar et al., 2020). Increases in the productive capacity of domestic animals can compromise thermal acclimation and plasticity, creating further loss. Escalating demand for livestock products in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) may necessitate considerable adaptation in the face of new thermal environments (medium confidence) (Collier and Gebremedhin, 2015; Theusme et al., 2021). Heat effects on productivity have been summarised for pigs (da Fonseca de Oliveira et al., 2019), sheep and goats (Sejian et al., 2018), and cattle (Herbut et al., 2019). The direct effects of higher temperatures on the smaller ruminants (sheep and goats) are relatively muted, compared with large ruminants; goats are better able to cope with multiple stressors than sheep (Sejian et al., 2018). Under SSP5-8.5 to mid-century, land suitability for livestock production will decrease because of increased heat stress prevalence in mid and lower latitudes (high confidence) (Thornton et al., 2021).
