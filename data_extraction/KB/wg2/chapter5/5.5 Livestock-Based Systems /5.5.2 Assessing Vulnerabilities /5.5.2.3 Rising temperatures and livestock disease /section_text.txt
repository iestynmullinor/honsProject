Climate change will have effects on future distribution, incidence and severity of climate-sensitive infectious diseases of livestock (high confidence) (Bett et al., 2017). In an assessment of climate sensitivity of European human and domestic animal infectious pathogens, 63% were sensitive to rainfall and temperature, and zoonotic pathogens were more climate-sensitive than human- or animal-only pathogens (McIntyre et al., 2017). Over the last 75 years, >220 emerging zoonotic diseases, some associated with domesticated livestock, have been identified, several of which may be affected by climate change, particularly vector-borne diseases (Vaillancourt and Ogden, 2016; see Cross-Chapter Box ILLNESS in Chapter 2). Walsh et al. (2018) identified both temperature and rainfall as influential factors in predicting increasing anthrax outbreaks in northern latitudes. Growing infectious disease burdens in domesticated animals may have wide-ranging impacts on the vulnerability of rural livestock producers in the future, particularly related to human health and projected increases in zoonoses (high confidence) (Bett et al., 2017; Heffernan, 2018; Rushton et al., 2018; Meade et al., 2019).
