Information on future climate variability changes on livestock system productivity does not exist yet. Increases in climate variability may increase food insecurity in the future, mediated through increased crop and livestock production variability (Thornton and Herrero, 2014) in LMICs. Rainfall variability increases in pastoral lands have been linked to declining cattle numbers (Megersa et al., 2014). Changes in future climate variability may have large negative impacts on livestock system outcomes (Sloat et al., 2018; Stanimirova et al., 2019); these effects can be larger than those associated with gradual climate change (limited evidence, medium agreement ) (Godde et al., 2019). In grasslands, Chang et al. (2017) (Europe) and Godde et al. (2020) (globally) projected increases in biomass inter-annual variability, the worst effects occurring in rangeland communities that are already vulnerable. Ways in which climate variability impacts have been addressed in the past, such as via herd mobility, may become increasingly unviable in the future (Hobbs et al., 2008).
