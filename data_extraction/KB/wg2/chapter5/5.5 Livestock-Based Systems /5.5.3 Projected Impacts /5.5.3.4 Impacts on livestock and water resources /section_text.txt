Water resources for livestock may decrease in places because of increased runoff and reduced groundwater resources, as well as decreased groundwater availability in some environments (AR5). Increased temperatures will cause changes in river flow and the amount of water stored in basins, potentially leading to increased water stress in dry areas such as parts of the Volta River Basin (Mul et al., 2015). Toure (2017) estimated decreases in groundwater recharge rates of 49% and of stored groundwater by 24% to the 2030s in the Klela Basin in Mali under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, with potentially serious consequences for water availability for livestock and irrigation.Water intake by livestock is related to species, breed, animal size, age, diet, animal activity, temperature and physiological status of animals (Henry et al., 2018). Direct water use by cattle may increase by 13% for a temperature increase of 2.7Â°C in a subtropical region (Harle et al., 2007). Changes in water availability may arise because of decreased supply or increased competition from other sectors. Availability changes may be accompanied by shifts in water quality, such as increased levels of microorganisms and algae, that can negatively affect livestock health (Naqvi et al., 2015). In arid lands, projected decreases in water availability will severely compromise reproductive performance and productivity in sheep (Naqvi et al., 2017). In higher-input livestock systems, water costs may increase substantially owing to increased competition for water (Rivera-Ferre et al., 2016).
