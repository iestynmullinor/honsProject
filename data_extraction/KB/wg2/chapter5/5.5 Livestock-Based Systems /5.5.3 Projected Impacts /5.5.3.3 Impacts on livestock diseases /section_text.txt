The impacts of climate change on livestock diseases remain highly uncertain (medium evidence, high agreement ). Bett et al. (2017) showed positive associations between rising temperature and expansion of the geographical ranges of arthropod vectors such asCulicoides imicola, which transmits the bluetongue virus. A 1-in-20-year bluetongue outbreak at present-day temperatures is projected to increase in frequency to 1-in-5 to 1-in-7 years by the 2050s, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, although animal movement restrictions can prevent devastating outbreaks (Jones et al., 2019). The prevalence and occurrence of some livestock diseases are positively associated with extreme weather events (high confidence). There are high risks of future Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreaks under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 this century in East Africa and beyond (Taylor et al., 2016; Mweya et al., 2017).Few studies explicitly consider the biotic and abiotic factors that interact additively, multiplicatively or antagonistically to influence hostâ€“pathogen dynamics (Cable et al., 2017). Integrative concepts that aim to improve the health of people, animals and the environment such as One Health may offer a framework for enhancing understanding of these complex interactions (Zinsstag et al., 2018). Much remains unknown concerning disease transmission dynamics under a warming climate (Heffernan, 2018), highlighting the need for effective monitoring of livestock disease (Brito et al., 2017; Hristov et al., 2018).
