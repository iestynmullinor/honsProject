Livestock play important social (Kitalyi et al., 2005) and cultural (Gandini and Villa, 2003) roles in many societies. Climate change will negatively affect the provisioning of social benefits in many of the world’s grasslands (medium confidence). Examples include moving to semi-private land ownership models, driven in part by climate change, that are changing social networks and limiting socio-ecological resilience in pastoral systems in East Africa (Kibet et al., 2016; Bruyere et al., 2018) and Asia (Cao et al., 2018a); altering traditional food, resource and medicine sharing mechanisms in West Africa (Boafo et al., 2016); and the limited ability of current livestock systems to satisfy societies’ demand for CES in Northwest Europe (Bengtsson et al., 2019). The societal impacts of climate change on livestock systems may interact with drivers of change and increase herders’ vulnerability via processes of sedentarisation and land fragmentation, both of which may result in decreased animal access to rangelands (Adhikari et al., 2015; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter). Stronger linkages are needed between ecosystem service and food security research and policy to address these challenges (Gentle and Thwaites, 2016; Bengtsson et al., 2019).
