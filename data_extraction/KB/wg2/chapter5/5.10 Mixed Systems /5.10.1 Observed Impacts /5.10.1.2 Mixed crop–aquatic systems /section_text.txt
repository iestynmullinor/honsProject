Households may have a mix of aquatic and land-based food production, contributing to food security and nutrition and income generation (Freed et al., 2020; see also discussion of aquaponics and hydroponics in Section 5.10.4.3. and combined rice–aquatic species production in Section 5.9.4). Failures in agricultural outputs due to climate-associated factors may result in diversification to fisheries as a way of alleviating food production shortfalls; for example, fisheries landings may dramatically increase after agricultural failures following hurricanes, which can subsequently create overfishing collapses (Cottrell et al., 2019). Where climatic impact drivers affect multiple sectors, adaptation may become more difficult because of the interacting challenges (Cottrell et al., 2019). One study of 12 countries with high food insecurity levels found that fish-reliant households utilised as much land as those not reliant on fish (Fisher et al., 2017). To meet food security requirements, most of these households needed to both farm and fish, illustrating the interdependence of aquatic–terrestrial food systems.
