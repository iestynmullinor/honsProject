Agroforestry is frequently mentioned as a strategy to adapt to and mitigate climate change and address food security (de Coninck et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2019c). There is strong evidence of net positive biophysical and socioeconomic effects of agroforestry systems under both smallholder and large-scale mechanised production systems (Quandt et al., 2017; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Sida et al., 2018; Wood and Baudron, 2018; Table 5.10; Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2; Quandt et al., 2019). Many of these effects also reduce climate risk. At the same time, agroforestry systems are subject to impacts from climate change, potentially reducing the benefits they provide. Still, there is limited evidence of observed climate impacts on agroforestry systems, and modelling climate impacts is more complex for agroforestry than for single cropping systems (Luedeling et al., 2014).
