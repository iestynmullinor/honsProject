There is medium confidence in the effectiveness of changing the nature of the integration between crops and livestock as an adaptation: moving from crops to livestock, moving from livestock to crops, and moving from one species of livestock to others, for example (Roy et al., 2018). Such transitions that increase integration between farm enterprises may contribute to risk reduction and increased food security. In areas with adequate rainfall and relatively limited rainfall variability under climate change, where agricultural diversity is the greatest, transitions towards more diverse and integrated systems may bring substantial adaptation benefits (Waha et al., 2018).Barriers to increasing integration and diversification include policies which support cereals and crop specialisation, lack of markets, limited post-harvest processing, limited technical or biophysical research on implementation and poor market infrastructure (Keatinge et al., 2015; Bodin et al., 2016; Garibaldi et al., 2016; Bassett and Kon√©, 2017; Kongsager, 2017; Rhiney et al., 2018; Roesch-McNally et al., 2018; Clay and King, 2019; Ickowitz et al., 2019). Proactive policy and market development are needed to reduce these barriers (Clay and King, 2019; Ickowitz et al., 2019; See 5.14.3.8 for Insurance).
