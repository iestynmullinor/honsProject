Agroforestry, the purposeful integration of trees or shrubs with crop or livestock systems, increases resilience against climate risks through a range of biophysical and economic effects (high confidence). Traditional agroforestry has been practiced for millennia and provides prime examples of sustainable agroecological production systems meeting the production, income and socio-cultural needs of farming communities within their ecological niches, but market forces have often led to their demise (McNeely and Schroth, 2006; Plieninger and Schaar, 2008; García-Martínez et al., 2016; Krčmářová and Jeleček, 2016; Coq-Huelva et al., 2017; Paudel et al., 2017; Doddabasawa et al., 2018; Maezumi et al., 2018; Lincoln, 2020). The wide range of options to associate different trees with crops, livestock and aquaculture allows agroforestry to be practiced in most regions, including those with precipitation regimes ranging from semi-arid to humid. While most agroforestry systems occur in smallholder settings, there are examples of successful industrial-scale mechanised agroforestry systems (Feliciano et al., 2018; Lovell et al., 2018). Agroforestry delivers medium to large benefits to all five land challenges described in the SRCCL—climate change mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land degradation and food security—and is considered to have broad adaptation and moderate mitigation potential compared with other land challenges (Smith et al., 2019c). Agroforestry is also able to deliver multiple biophysical and socioeconomic benefits (Table 5.12).Table 5.12 |  Some of the biophysical and socioeconomic benefits of agroforestry.ContributionPathwayReferencesIncreased food security and household incomeDiversification of production, avoiding trade-offs between crop and tree productsNath et al.

(2017)See Section 5.12The adoption and maintenance of agroforestry practices require appropriate incentives or the removal of barriers (high confidence). Agroforestry adoption has been limited to date in both higher-income and lower-income countries. Several constraints need to be carefully addressed for successful scaling-up of agroforestry systems, including costs of establishment, limited short-term benefits, lack of reliable financial support to incentivise longer-term returns on investments, land tenure, knowledge of and experience with trees and the management of multiple component systems, and inadequate market access, (Coulibaly et al., 2017; Iiyama et al., 2017; Jacobi et al., 2017; Kongsager, 2017; Hernández-Morcillo et al., 2018; Iiyama et al., 2018; Lincoln, 2019). Kongsager (2017) and Roupsard et al. (2020) also highlight the need for vertical integration of measures from local to national scales to successfully address local barriers to adoption. Although there are few studies evaluating the long-term performance of agroforestry systems (Coe et al., 2014; Meijer et al., 2015; Brockington et al., 2016; Kongsager, 2017; Toth et al., 2017), the available results suggest that successful adoption of agroforestry practices depends strongly on the local enabling environment, including appropriate markets, technologies and delivery systems (medium evidence, high agreement ).
