Important information gaps exist concerning the costs and benefits of many adaptation options in mixed systems, where the interactions between farming enterprises may be complex. Among communal crop–livestock farmers in Eastern Cape Province of South Africa, Bahta (2016) reported high levels of vulnerability to drought and highlighted the need for more coordination between monitoring agencies in terms of reliable early-warning information that can be communicated appropriately, between farmers’ organisations and the private sector to facilitate adaptation options that can overcome feed shortages such as fodder purchases in times of drought, and between government departments at the national and provincial level that address the concerns and needs of affected communities. Nyamushamba (2017) reviewed the use of indigenous beef cattle breeds in smallholder mixed production systems in southern Africa. Some of these breeds exhibit adaptive traits such as drought and heat tolerance and resistance to tick-borne diseases. However, their adaptation potential in crossbreeding programmes is essentially unknown, as most African cattle populations are still largely uncharacterised.
