This chapter assesses the scientific literature produced after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th Assessment Report (AR5) dealing with past, current and future climate change effects on managed ecosystems that provide provisioning and cultural services. It spans low- and high-intensity production systems for food, feed, fibre and other ecosystem products.Climate change has already had global impacts, including in high-income countries. Special emphasis is placed on the assessment of vulnerabilities of particular groups that are context- and location-specific, such as Indigenous Peoples and other minorities, women and small-scale food producers. The report builds on the IPCC AR5 and recent Special Reports. This chapter combines food systems, fibre, wood and other products from ecosystems previously detailed in separate chapters of AR5, with an increased focus on ecosystem services, including the long-term sustainability of the global food system (Figure 5.1). The chapter focuses on key climate risks, implementation and outcomes of adaptation solutions for different groups as well as limits to adaptation.Figure 5.1 | Conceptual framework of Chapter 5.
