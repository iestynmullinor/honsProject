This chapter is taking a food systems approach similar to the food security chapter in SRCCL (Mbow et al., 2019), with close attention to food system linkages, interactions and impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity (Steffen et al., 2015; Raworth, 2017; Gerten et al., 2020). Food security is defined as “a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO, 2020). Food insecurity is often experienced as chronic hunger reported in the annual UN Food Security and Nutrition in the World (FAO, 2020), when a person is unable to consume enough food over an extended period. The chapter gives special attention to climate change impacts on acute food insecurity, which can occur at any time with a severity that threatens lives, livelihoods or both, regardless of the causes, context or duration, as a result of shocks risking determinants of food security and nutrition, and used to assess the need for humanitarian action (IPC Global Partners, 2019).Climate change directly affects food systems, and the impacts on terrestrial or aquatic food production will become increasingly negative, although regionally some changes may be beneficial in the near future (Porter et al., 2014). Current food system trajectories are leading to biodiversity loss and land and aquatic ecosystem degradation without delivering food security, nutrition, and sustainable and healthy livelihoods to many (Steffen et al., 2015). Addressing climate change in isolation ignores these interconnections, which is why the chapter considers integrated adaptation solutions to allow humanity to thrive in the long term. At the same time, social foundations of equality, justice and political participation are crucial in order to move towards a safe operating space for humanity (Raworth, 2017). The SDGs provide the most comprehensive set of metrics of humanity’s progress in achieving equitable and thriving socio-ecological systems. Therefore, while the focus of this chapter is climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation of food systems, feed, fibre and other ecosystem products, other environmental and social challenges are considered concomitantly.Food system and natural systems interact via political, economic, social, cultural and demographic factors in complex ways, leading to food security and sustainability outcomes. The food system has a supply (production) and demand (consumption) side, connected via processing, trade and retail, with loss and waste streams all along the food chain. Natural ecosystems provide multiple services (regulating, supporting, provisioning, cultural) to the food system. Food security and nutrition strongly depend on the driving forces connecting food and natural systems while at the same time positively or negatively influencing them. Climate change frequently exacerbates the effects of other drivers of change, further limiting the environment within which humanity can safely operate and thrive. The chapter assesses how climate change affects the four pillars of food security and nutrition and how these effects can be mediated by various factors, including our adaptation responses, social equity, underlying ecosystem services and governance (Figure 5.1). Adaptation solutions are a major emphasis of this chapter, including many ecosystem-based adaptation options (Table 5.1), which fall under the broader umbrella of nature-based solutions (Seddon et al., 2020).Ecosystem-based adaptation, defined as the ‘use of ecosystem management activities to increase the resilience and reduce the vulnerability of people and ecosystems to climate change’ (Campbell et al., 2009), has at its core the recognition that there are unexploited synergies in agricultural systems that can increase productivity and resilience. These can result from increasing biodiversity, adding organic matter to soils, integrating livestock and aquatic species, including aquaculture, into farming practices, broadening landscape practices to exploit crop–forestry synergies, supporting beneficial insect populations and altering pest management practices that have unintended negative consequences. In addition, the chapter considers socioeconomic strategies to build resilience in the food system, strengthening local and regional economies, building on Indigenous and local knowledge, and addressing social inequity, through inclusive, participatory and democratic governance of food systems (HLPE, 2019; Wezel et al., 2020).Table 5.1 | Adaptation strategies assessment in food, fibre and other ecosystem provisioning services.Adaptation strategies/optionsSystemsBenefitsConstraints or enablersConfidenceRelevant sectionsEcosystem-based integrated approaches such as agroecology that increase soil organic matter, enhance soil and water conservation, and diversify food production systemsCertain types of urban agricultureCropsImprove resilience of food systemsProvide mitigation measures and co-benefits in health, ecosystem services and other SDGsImprove productivity and yield stabilitySecure tenure arrangements are often critical for delivering successful ecosystem-based adaptationHigh(5.4.4.5, 5.6.3, 5.12.3, Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL in Chapter 2, 5.14.3.6, 5.14.3.11;
