Community-based adaptation (CbA) strategies, which involve locally driven, place-based adaptation approaches, can help build adaptive capacity to climate change impacts, but require explicit attention to power dynamics, respect for local and Indigenous knowledge systems, adequate resources, future climatic trends and coordination at multiple levels of governance to be effective (high confidence) (Spires et al., 2014; Fernández-Giménez et al., 2015; Nagoda, 2015; Ashley et al., 2016; Berner et al., 2016; Ensor et al., 2016; Avtar et al., 2019; Lam et al., 2019; Silwal et al., 2019; McNamara et al., 2020; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2020; Rossa, 2020; Uchiyama et al., 2020). Since AR5, there is strong evidence that participation of local stakeholders in adaptation planning and implementation improves communities’ capacity to monitor and respond to climate change impacts on food, fibre and forestry systems, provided that adequate resources and local knowledge on climate change exist. Participatory monitoring of climate change impacts and participatory scenario development to develop community action plans are examples, which can help strengthen community preparation for and response to climate impacts.Community-based monitoring of forests, coral reefs, seagrass and mangroves are examples of local natural resource assessment that can support food security and livelihoods while informing regional and national climate change planning tools (Carter et al., 2014; Gevaña et al., 2018; Avtar et al., 2019). Negotiation among many stakeholders at multiple scales, including inclusive mechanisms to address power inequities in governance structures and communities, may be needed for CbA to be effective (Avtar et al., 2019; McNamara et al., 2020). Indigenous knowledge and community-based management of fisheries and aquaculture in the Arctic and Asia (Roux et al., 2019; Chen and Cheng, 2020; Galappaththi et al., 2020a; Schott et al., 2020; Galappaththi et al., 2021) provide adaptive strategies for sustainable use. (Iticha and Husen, 2019). Community-based climate services in the Andes (managed through a collaboration of smallholder producers and an international partnership) built capacity and knowledge of climate change dynamics as well as trust in local climate institutions, providing meaningful information for regional responses to climate change impacts (Rossa, 2020). Community-based participatory scenario planning can help identify multiple climate stressors and vulnerabilities to develop effective adaptation plans (Fernández-Giménez et al., 2015; Bennett et al., 2016; Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter).An assessment of 32 different CbA initiatives in the Pacific Islands, including addressing risks to food security, found high-performing projects had six key entry points: effective methods to improve adaptive capacity, appropriate to the local context, which moved beyond narrow geographical definitions of community to consider equity of impact, and ecosystem-based approaches, jointly addressing climatic and non-livelihood pressures and consideration of future climatic trends (McNamara et al., 2020). Low-performing initiatives, in contrast, were not sustained; these overlooked future climatic trends in their initiatives, such as beehive susceptibility to climate extremes, and had dependent, unequal relationships that lacked genuine local approval or ownership and did not fit local values and context (Spires et al., 2014; McNamara et al., 2020; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2020). CbA initiatives can also suffer from not having adequate local knowledge of potential strategies to address future climatic scenarios, and may lead to maladaptation, increasing socioeconomic inequities in communities (Nagoda, 2015). Addressing inequity in power dynamics and building technical adaptive capacity of local people are some of the ways that CbA initiatives can support more resilient food systems (McNamara et al., 2020).
