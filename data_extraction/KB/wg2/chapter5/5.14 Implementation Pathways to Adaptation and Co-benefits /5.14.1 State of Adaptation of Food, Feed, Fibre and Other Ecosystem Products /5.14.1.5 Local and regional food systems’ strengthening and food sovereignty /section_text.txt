Food sovereignty brings together adaptation options based on agroecological methods, access to resources, collective and CbA (HLPE, 2019). Addressing food security and nutrition in light of climate change impacts and vulnerabilities is considered to arise from a mixture of globalised supply chains and local production, not one or the other (Blesh et al., 2019; Stringer et al., 2020). Evidence on strengthening local and regional food systems with a food sovereignty approach, in terms of access to resources (land, seeds, water), shortened food chains and CbA strategies suggest that these strategies can positively contribute to climate change adaptation in many contexts (medium confidence) (SRCCL) but can also lead to conflict especially regarding management of mobile resources such as fisheries (Section 5.8, Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter). All these options can build adaptation through actions that strengthen local capacities and the power to act within food systems. Securing and recognising tenure for Indigenous Peoples (Hurlbert et al., 2019) and local communities (Oates et al., 2020) can improve their ability to adapt by increasing the incentive to invest in resilient infrastructure and sustainable land management practices. Community seed banks and networks strengthen local seed systems and realise farmers’ rights favouring access to a variety of local genetic resources, with landraces often more adapted to the local social, cultural and ecological environment and needs, and better adapted to harsh environments without external inputs (Mousseau, 2015; Bisht et al., 2018; Maharjan and Maharjan, 2018; Otieno et al., 2018; Mbow et al., 2019). This plays a key role in PPB (Section 5.4.4.5; FAO, 2019e). The integration of informal and formal seed system elements is important for the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers (Westengen and Brysting, 2014; Westengen and Berg, 2016; FAO, 2019e).Strengthening both local and regional food systems is a strategy to increase resilience (Schipanski et al., 2016; Palmer et al., 2017), resource use efficiency (Mu et al., 2019) and self-reliance (medium evidence, low agreement ) (Griffin et al., 2015; Chapin et al., 2016; Karg et al., 2016). Collective trademarks (Quiñones-Ruiz et al., 2015) and participatory guarantee systems (Niederle et al., 2020) are examples of innovative institutional strategies to strengthen local and regional food systems. In the urban context, the city region food system (CRFS) approach is motivated by reducing dependence on international trade and associated instability and to facilitate local decision making (Karg et al., 2016). CRFS includes a network within a regional landscape around one urban centre and surrounding peri-urban and rural regions (Blay-Palmer et al., 2018). UPA is promoted as an effective strategy to adapt to climate change in different contexts (see Section 5.12.5.3, Dubbeling, 2015; Lwasa et al., 2015). To cope with the effects of climate change, strengthening regional food systems is becoming an explicit part of urban and regional policy, being tested in many different cities worldwide (Dubbeling et al., 2017; Blay-Palmer et al., 2018; Berner et al., 2019; Sellberg et al., 2020; van der Gaast et al., 2020). Strengthening both local and regional food systems has to be balanced against limitations and trade-offs, since modelling exercises of regionalisation scenarios show urban agriculture cannot achieve food security in areas with rapid population growth (Le Mouël et al., 2018). Furthermore, international trade can compensate in cases where the regional system fails due to extreme events or other related climate shocks (Section 5.11.8).
