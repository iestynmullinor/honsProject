Recent literature highlights the future challenges of producing the quantities of food needed to feed a growing world population in a way that satisfies nutritional needs, benefits everyone equally and equitably, and minimises the negative impacts of food systems on the environment and the natural resource base. There is broad agreement that current trajectories towards the SDGs and countries’ commitments under the Paris Agreement are slow and that transformation of food systems is needed (medium agreement , robust evidence) (Campbell et al., 2018; Brondizio et al., 2019; Dury et al., 2019; EAT-LANCET, 2019; FAO, 2019 f; Food and Land Use Coalition, 2019; Sachs et al., 2019; Searchinger, 2019a; Searchinger T, 2019b; Loboguerrero et al., 2020; Meridian Institute, 2020; Steiner A, 2020).Recent reviews have summarised literature on production system transformations, driven at least in part by a changing climate or changing climate variability. Such transformations may involve sometimes substantial shifts in farm and livelihood enterprises and land configurations, including intensification, diversification, sedentarisation and abandonment of agriculture (Vermeulen et al., 2018; Thornton et al., 2019). Relevant literature is summarised in Table 5.24, showing reported farmers’ perceptions of the drivers of change and the different outcomes of these changes. The consequences of these production system transitions have been mixed; in about 40% of cases, the outcomes at household level have been unequivocally beneficial. In the other cases, there were detrimental effects on livelihoods, or a mixture of positive and negative effects. The effects on nutritional security reported in these studies were limited. Different enablers of change appear critical if transitions are to have positive outcomes. Policy environments, defined in terms of multi-level governance structures and institutions, are a key driver of systems change, as well as being enablers of and barriers to adaptation responses (Xu et al., 2008; Namgay et al., 2014; Galvin et al., 2015; Schmidt and Pearson, 2016; Liao and Fei, 2017). Policies around property and grazing rights are directly linked to small-scale food producer vulnerability, and land ownership changes will pose a key challenge as climate change impacts in the marginal lands intensify (Reid et al., 2014). Collective action at multiple scales and effective governance structures are also a key enabler of transformational change, for helping community initiatives overcome economic, social and technical barriers, and to strengthen social capital and farmer knowledge (Haglund et al., 2011; Reed et al., 2017; Vermeulen et al., 2018; Fedele et al., 2019). Market development has been shown to be a critical factor for successful adaptation at scale in sub-Saharan Africa (Ouédraogo et al., 2017; Iiyama et al., 2018; Totin et al., 2018). At the same time, financing mechanisms may be a crucial enabler for different food system actors: de-risking agricultural production and food system investments for producers and input suppliers, for example, that address core market failures and compensate actors for extra short-term costs that can lead to longer-term benefits, particularly for small-scale producers and businesses with comparatively low access to technologies and services (Vermeulen et al., 2018; Millan, 2019; see Section 5.1 4.2.5).The examples in Table 5.24 highlight the uneven impact of adaptation programmes and projects in general, due in part to differences in institutional support and failure of policies to take into account inequities (Clay and King, 2019; Nightingale et al., 2020). Focusing on transformational adaptation, Vermeulen (2018) suggested the need to expand the remit of adaptation planning to consider the multi-functionality of agriculture and a system-wide view of food production and consumption. Several authors argue that transformational change must address the personal, practical and political spheres, in view of the role of power relations and worldviews in shaping practices, food security and inequity (O’Brien, 2015; Nightingale, 2017; O’Brien, 2018; Eriksen et al., 2019; Gosnell et al., 2019). If it involves new or unfamiliar technology, transformation may also be highly disruptive, and the added vulnerabilities of food system actors at risk will need to be addressed (Herrero et al., 2020; see Box 5.5).Table 5.24 | Agricultural and livelihood system transformations from systematic searches of the literature, which are at least partially attributable to climatic factors and that involve increased or decreased system integration, and major consequences of the change.
