Indigenous knowledge (IK) and local knowledge (LK), while an important component of many adaptation strategies (Reyes-García, 2014; Roue, 2018), continues to be marginalised in food systems; greater integration will increase effectiveness (high confidence) (Ford et al., 2015; Brugnach et al., 2017; Figueroa-Helland et al., 2018). Where Indigenous Peoples have access to and control over their lands and natural resources, food systems can potentially be more sustainably managed and more resilient (high confidence) (Rumbach and Foley, 2014; O’Connell-Milne, 2015; Camacho et al., 2016; Janhiainen, 2017; Kihila, 2018). For example, on Solomon Islands, community-based adaptation combining with IK-informed community mapping helped boost agricultural yields sustainably (Leon et al., 2015), and in China people living in rich plant resource regions have used their wild plants IK to complement the decrease of crop yields during extreme droughts to ensure food security (Zhang et al., 2016). These cases have led scientists and local communities to call for more practical actions to bridge local knowledge, IK and formal science (Borquez et al., 2017; Klenk et al., 2017; Mukhopadhyay, 2017; Olorunfemi, 2017; Reyes-Garcia et al., 2019). Despite this increased public and scientific recognition, IK is often not acknowledged or used.Effective adaptation requires a more holistic approach that includes the recognition of Indigenous rights, governance systems and laws (high confidence) (Robinson et al., 2016a; Brugnach et al., 2017; Magni, 2017; McMillen et al., 2017; McNeeley, 2017; Pearce et al., 2018), and to couple IK with proactive and regionally coherent adaptation plans, actions and cooperation (Shaffer, 2014; Melvin et al., 2017; Forbis Jr. and Hayhoe, 2018; Makondo and Thomas, 2018).Supporting Indigenous groups’ knowledge and other excluded social groups can help preserve and harness underutilised resources to enhance nutritional and economic security, with careful measures in protecting Indigenous intellectual rights and avoiding commodification exploitation (Nakashima et al., 2012; Nandal and Bhardwaj, 2014; Ghosh-Jerath et al., 2015; Ebert, 2017). In some regions, there has been a loss of IK about food systems, reducing adaptive capacity (Richards et al., 2019; Panikkar and Lemmond, 2020). Knowledge exchange between Indigenous elders and youth can support adaptive capacity (Osterhoudt, 2018; Richards et al., 2019; Zin et al., 2019). Education utilising IK and LK can help prevent maladaptation options (high confidence) (Melvin et al., 2017; Taremwa, 2017; Forbis Jr. and Hayhoe, 2018; Narayan et al., 2020). There are examples of integrating IK and LK into resource management systems and school curricula and in local institutions with existing decision-making process to strengthen their capacity to address climate change (Huaman and Valdiviezo, 2014; McNamara and Prasad, 2014; Abah et al., 2015; Mistry and Berardi, 2016; Tschakert et al., 2017; McNeeley et al., 2018; McNeeley et al., 2020). However, there are limitations of IK and LK to address future climate impacts. Therefore, it is important that science-based knowledge and other knowledge coalesce to produce solutions that are sustainable and viable in the face of projected impacts of climate change. Community-based adaptation approaches can integrate IK and LK and more formal knowledge systems, provided efforts to establish relationships of respect, trust and common understanding between different stakeholders involved (Herath et al., 2015; Camacho et al., 2016; Fidelman et al., 2017; Inaotombi and Mahanta, 2019; Lam et al., 2019).
