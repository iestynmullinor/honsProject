Flow of adaptation finance in the agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture and forestry sectors is impeded by weak measurement and benchmarking of financial and resilience outcomes (Kramer et al., 2019; Negra et al., 2020), and challenges in assessing repayment capacity of investee producers and companies (medium confidence). Immature information systems (e.g., weak analytics, fragmented standards) (Woodard et al., 2019; Negra et al., 2020) inhibit effective due diligence and impact assessment, contributing to uncertainty and low investor confidence (Havemann et al., 2020; NGFS, 2020). Improved characterisation of adaptation finance strategies (e.g., insurance, subsidies, blended finance) requires increased transaction volume (Millan et al., 2019) and analysis of financial (e.g., riskâ€“return profile, investor demand) and resilience (e.g., reduced vulnerability) effects.Use of climate-resilient financial strategies and instruments is limited by weak incentives, which commonly take the form of high upfront costs (Verdolini et al., 2018), high transaction and intermediation costs (Havemann et al., 2020) and relatively long pay-off time. Tenant producers may not experience benefits from adaptation investments (Woodard et al., 2019). Investors seek low-risk, liquid investments and credit-worthy counterparties (Havemann et al., 2020), yet small- and medium-sized producers and supply chain actors often lack access to formal credit. Given limited experience and weak information for adaptation finance, sub-optimal outcomes may include imbalanced allocation of public and private finance (e.g., to less vulnerable regions and producers; to lower-resilience investments; to short-term benefits) as well as inequitable division of risks and returns (e.g., within blended finance structures) (Clapp, 2017; World Bank, 2018; Attridge and Engen, 2019). Additionally, while risk-sharing finance strategies can deliver adaptation benefits, they do not inherently reduce overall risk and commonly cover only specified types of risks (Kellett and Peters, 2014; Watson et al., 2015).Methods to strengthen adaptation finance include updating regulations and policies to support adaptation finance instruments (e.g., climate accounting standards), requiring climate-risk disclosure, improved information-sharing among public and private sector actors and devolving funding to local actors (medium confidence) (Global Commission on Adaptation, 2019; Millan et al., 2019).
