Addressing gender and other social inequities (e.g., racial, ethnicity, age, income, geographic location) in markets, governance and control over resources is a key enabling condition for climate-resilient transitions in land and aquatic ecosystems (high confidence) (Pearse, 2017; Vermeulen et al., 2018; Blesh et al., 2019; Rao et al., 2019b; Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18, Section 5,13,1; Tavenner et al., 2019). Adaptation strategies can have negative impacts on marginalised social groups and worsen socioeconomic inequities unless explicit efforts are made to address unequal power dynamics and differences in access to resources in agricultural, fisheries, aquaculture, livestock and forestry systems (high confidence) (Glemarec, 2017; Haji and Legesse, 2017; Nagoda and Nightingale, 2017 ; Nightingale, 2017; Rao et al., 2019b; Huyer and Partey, 2020; Mikulewicz, 2020; Taylor and Bhasme, 2020; Eriksen et al., 2021). Technical approaches to adaptation that ignore inequities can worsen them; see, for example, the case study on Climate Smart Agriculture (Box 5.12). Enabling environments support inclusive decision making, capacity building, shifts in social rules, norms and behaviours and access to resources for marginalised groups for climate change adaptation (e.g., Tschakert et al., 2016; Ziervogel, 2019; Eriksen et al., 2021; Garcia et al., 2021).
