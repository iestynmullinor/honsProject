Climate resilient development pathways (CRDPs) introduced in AR5 (Denton, 2014) can briefly be described as ‘development trajectories that integrate adaptation and mitigation to realise the goal of sustainable development’ (see IPCC (2019a)) for a more extensive definition). Several characteristics were proposed in SR1.5 by which such CRDPs could be identified: consistency with principles of sustainable development; ability to deliver poverty reduction; ability to enhance social, gender, racial, ethnic and intergenerational equity; ability to deliver resilience to climate change and other shocks and stresses; and ability to protect species, biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services. There is an increasing literature, assessed in SR1.5, on adaptation pathways approaches, generally for specific regions, locations and subsectors.Two recent examples directly related to agriculture and food are the following: sustaining agrarian livelihoods to mid-century of Nicaraguan small-scale coffee producers using analyses of suitability and coffee quality changes under an IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 emissions scenario (Läderach et al., 2017); and development of participatory pathways to mid-century under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 support regional adaptation planning in Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand for agricultural producers and rural communities (Cradock-Henry et al., 2020). CRDPs mentioned in SROCC include shifting from providing coastal defences to adapting to seawater inundation in coastal regions (Renaud et al., 2015) and retreating coastal megacities (Solecki et al., 2017). Pathway frameworks continue to be used to frame the broad-scale challenges of development and climate change, thereby linking different types of food system actor with different responses through time using a variety of approaches, top-down and participatory, qualitative and quantitative (Butler et al., 2016; Antle et al., 2017; Thornton and Comberti, 2017; Collste et al., 2019; Loboguerrero et al., 2020; Stringer et al., 2020).While there is consensus that the concept of CRDPs is useful, there are major challenges in identifying, operationalising, monitoring and evaluating them (Lin et al., 2017; Bloemen et al., 2018). Management approaches seldom integrate across spatio-temporal scales and may be unable to address unidirectional change and extreme events (Holsman et al., 2019). The socioeconomic complexities and implications of pursuing integrated outcomes make it difficult to evaluate synergies and trade-offs associated with different actions in local contexts through time (Thornton and Comberti, 2017; Ellis and Tschakert, 2019; Holsman et al., 2019; Orchard, 2019). Case studies by Lo (2019) of transformation in a fishing town in south China and by Gajjar (2019) on undesirable path dependencies in development trajectories in urban and rural India show that overall adaptive capacity of populations may be decreased though politicisation and entrenchment of existing inequities, severely limiting the possibilities for future adaptation. A further challenge of implementation is timely detection of tipping points and abrupt exposure events in both climate and environmental systems (Lenton et al., 2019; Trisos et al., 2020), which may alter the efficacy of current and planned adaptation actions, necessitating a switch to other, more transformational strategies; in such cases, re-energising food system actors’ commitment to adaptation action may well be needed (Bloemen et al., 2018).Integrated modelling of CRDPs will increasingly be needed to throw light on key SDG synergies and trade-offs into the future (Bleischwitz et al., 2018). In investigating possible future pressures on land under the SSPs, Doelman (2018) projected that the largest changes take place in sub-Saharan Africa in SSP3 and SSP4, mostly because of continued high population growth coupled with (projected) sluggish increases in agricultural efficiency, among other things, leading to expansion of agricultural land for crop and livestock production and reduced food security. Lassaletta (2019) evaluated global pig production in the SSPs and concluded that the future sustainability of pig systems will depend on production efficiency improvements coupled with other factors such as use of alternative feed sources and use of slurries on cropland. Such studies will be increasingly important for quantifying the potential trade-offs and synergies between different SDGs, to guide adaptation (and mitigation) action along CRDPs in the future. The current lack of widely accepted and simple-to-measure indicators for tracking progress in adaptation is a significant hurdle to overcome. There is a large literature on the desirable characteristics of future global food systems, but much less on robust analysis that explicitly addresses and evaluates the pathways towards these desired futures. Gerten (2020) estimates that 10.2 billion people can be supported within key planetary boundaries via spatially redistributed cropland and dietary changes, among other actions. There are few, if any, analyses for detailing the plausible pathways to move towards such a future in ways that are socially, economically and environmentally acceptable through time; whether such pathways could indeed be made climate-resilient is unknown. Appropriate monitoring and rapid feedback to food system actors on what is working and why will be critical to the successful operationalisation of adaptation actions within CRDPs (Bosomworth and Gaillard, 2019).
