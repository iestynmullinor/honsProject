Indigenous people and ethnic minorities, many of them having special cultural associations to local foods, are particularly vulnerable to climate change owing to changes in the availability of wild foods, crop failure and food production losses or increased food prices (Norton-Smith et al., 2016; Otto et al., 2017).Changes in sea level rise or coastal erosion can reduce ecosystem services to a point where either subsidies are used to enable human populations to remain in their place of attachment, or ultimately to displace coastal residents, thereby removing connections to places of intrinsic value. For example, the United Houma Nation in Louisiana is experiencing coastal land loss, sea level rise and strong Gulf hurricanes, which leads to the relocation of some tribes causing loss of Houma identity (Sullivan and Rosenberg, 2018). Another example is the relocation of Alaska Native communities due to climate change (Hamilton et al., 2016)Expansion of agriculture can bring distress to Indigenous communities because of environmental deterioration and the stress associated with relocation or displacement (Otto et al., 2017). A/R programmes can also bring inequities to Indigenous communities (Godden and Tehan, 2016) and even violent displacement with tragic results (Celentano et al., 2017). A/R programmes can negatively affect a range of substantial and procedural Indigenous Peoples’ rights entrenched in international human rights law (Table 5.22) and their potential for climate change adaptation (high confidence).Table 5.22 | Indigenous rights recognised in international human rights law negatively affected by A/R projects.Negative impacts of monoculture plantations (and other A/R projects)  Indigenous Peoples’ rights affectedDegree of certaintyReferencesLocal community not informed, not adequately consulted, not provided means for meaningful participation in project design, implementation, and monitoring (with specific attention to women and poor households); disruption or non-recognition of local or traditional institutions; elite capture; no access to third-party grievance mechanisms.Right to self-determination; consultation and free, prior and informed consent (FPIC); participationMedium evidence, high agreement Aggarwal (2014), Maraseni et al.

Benefit sharing by direct cash transfer or in-kind modalities tends to not compensate lost income opportunities.

(2007), Aggarwal (2014), Cagalanan (2016), Witasari (2016), Corbera et al. (2017), Pye et al. (2017)A significant proportion of land targeted for A/R projects is inhabited and used by Indigenous Peoples and local communities (Cagalanan, 2016). Indigenous Peoples have rights to and/or manage at least 37.9 million km 2 of land and influence land management across at least 28.1% of the land area (Garnett et al., 2018). At least a quarter of the global land area is traditionally owned, managed, used or occupied by Indigenous Peoples, overlapping with 35–40% of the area that is formally protected (Garnett et al., 2018; Brondizio et al., 2019). In many cases, A/R is implemented in areas where tenure rights are insecure and Indigenous Peoples’ rights are at risk of being disregarded (Naughton-Treves and Wendland, 2014; Kohler and Brondizio, 2017; Garnett et al., 2018) (medium evidence, high agreement ). Many projects are also found in areas where complex socio-political contexts challenge management (Jurjonas and Seekamp, 2019). It is anticipated that A/R projects will create huge pressures on existing land uses and generate further land use conflicts (Aggarwal, 2014; Robinson et al., 2014; Paul et al., 2016; Brancalion and Chazdon, 2017; Pye et al., 2017; Bond et al., 2019). In addition, many afforestation projects are conducted in regions that are not bio-climatically suitable, leading to the degradation of ecosystems that are key to local livelihoods (Veldman et al., 2015; Robinson et al., 2016b).Until 2010, most A/F projects had technical, carbon-related goals and did not consider issues of livelihoods, community involvement or broader ecosystem impacts (Wolde et al., 2016). New strategies such as nature-based solutions (Seddon et al., 2020) and forest and landscape restoration (Brancalion and Chazdon, 2017) integrate a larger set of social and environmental objectives. Indigenous Peoples enjoy a range of co-benefits of A/F initiatives such as improved habitat, fire management or protection from climatic shocks such as drought (Robinson et al., 2016b; Seddon et al., 2020), provided they are able to manage carbon funds collectively, meet the monitoring and reporting requirements, and protect forests from illicit uses and natural disasters (Wolde et al., 2016).Policies and safeguards attached to specific A/R initiatives determine their impact (high confidence) (Talor, 2015; West, 2016; Brancalion and Chazdon, 2017). In countries where there is a great level of devolution of rights to Indigenous Peoples, there is a risk that the A/R agenda will lead to recentralisation (limited evidence, medium agreement ) (Bayrak and Marafa, 2016). Some A/R initiatives specify the need to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and protect biodiversity (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Seddon et al., 2020).Local communities’ ability to participate in project design, implementation and monitoring is directly linked to the autonomy and independence of local institutions (Pye et al., 2017), their ability to formulate by-laws (Wolde et al., 2016) and handle funds in a transparent way (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Witasari, 2016). It is further dependent on cohesion in the community (Cagalanan, 2016), the existence of clear rules delineating community membership and the presence of elders and community members with relevant local knowledge (Robinson et al., 2016b), and gender and out-migration dynamics affecting participation structures (robust evidence, medium agreement ) (Cormier-Salem and Panfili, 2016; Witasari, 2016; Wolde et al., 2016; Jurjonas and Seekamp, 2019).
