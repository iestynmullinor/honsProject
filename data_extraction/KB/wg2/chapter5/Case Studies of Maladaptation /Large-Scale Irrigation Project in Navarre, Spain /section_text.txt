Many small-scale producers could not afford the irrigation investment and had to sell or rent their land to those who joined the irrigation project. Many large-scale farmers using irrigation switched to corn and forage and dropped crops with high labour costs. Water costs are now paid to a private company, and small-scale farmers lost access to communal water rights. The project increased inequity and land concentration and lowered crop diversity, with small-scale producers more vulnerable to climate change. Large-scale intensive farmers are more exposed to crop price volatility than to climate vulnerability but have greater access to subsidies and water rights (Albizua et al., 2019).
