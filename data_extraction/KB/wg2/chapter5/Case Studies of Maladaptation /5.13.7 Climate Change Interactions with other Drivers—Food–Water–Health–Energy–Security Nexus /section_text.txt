Linkages between food security and nutrition with water and energy as well as other important socio-environmental issues are increasingly being described within a nexus framework (see also Chapters 3, 4, 6 and 7), with food systems frequently located at the centre of nexus concepts (Caron et al., 2018).Climate change will affect the food–energy–water (FEW) nexus, commonly in the form of risk multiplier (high confidence) (e.g., Conway et al., 2015; Barik et al., 2016; Keairns et al., 2016; Abbott et al., 2017; Ebhuoma and Simatele, 2017; Caron et al., 2018; D’Odorico et al., 2018; de Amorim et al., 2018; Mpandeli et al., 2018; Nhamo et al., 2018; Soto Golcher and Visseren-Hamakers, 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Amjath-Babu et al., 2019; Froese and Schilling, 2019; Mercure et al., 2019; Momblanch et al., 2019; Pastor et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2019). Xu et al. (2019) modelled the irrigation demand for large-scale maize production in Northeast China and concluded that increasing droughts under future climate change would lead to extreme shortage of irrigation water without adaptive measures. Barik et al. (2016) described how the growing demand for food in India has led to more irrigation with a reduction in groundwater levels in some regions.Increasing demands for food, energy and water can lead to domestic and international conflict, including political instability and migration, often in the context of drought (high confidence) (Abbott et al., 2017; Bush and Martiniello, 2017; WEF, 2017; D’Odorico et al., 2018; de Amorim et al., 2018). de Amorim et al. (2018) conclude that the FEW nexus is susceptible to many global risks, including extreme weather events and human migrations, and predominantly endangers vulnerable communities of less developed countries. There is emerging evidence that food and water insecurity enhances social conflicts, including protests and violent riots, at least partially, by accelerating existing grievances (Heslin, 2021; Koren et al., 2021). Closer coordination at global, regional and national levels could be recommended to manage these risks.Meeting growing demands for food, water and energy under a changing climate requires technical solutions and behavioural change as well as greater coordination across multilateral institutions and governance. Supply-side solutions focus on enhancing production, reducing food waste and loss or lowering water demand through both technological approaches (e.g., breeding, improved irrigation) and agroecological approaches, such as agroforestry, underutilised and more adapted crops, and transition towards a circular economy (Alexander et al., 2015; Obersteiner et al., 2016; D’Odorico et al., 2018; Nhamo et al., 2018; Soto Golcher and Visseren-Hamakers, 2018). Demand-side solutions focus primarily on changes in consumer behaviour towards healthier diets with lower carbon footprints, particularly reduction of meat consumption (Alexander et al., 2015; Obersteiner et al., 2016). Improving the coordination of multilateral organisations could result in improved cross-boundary management of natural resources, particularly related to water (Conway et al., 2015; Nhamo et al., 2018; Soto Golcher and Visseren-Hamakers, 2018).As relationships between individual subsystems are systemic, integrated solutions would result in better outcomes across the FEW nexus (strong agreement ). Obersteiner et al. (2016) concluded that single-sector policies can create strong trade-offs with other policy targets and SDGs, whereas strategies that reduce pressure on food production systems diminish trade-offs between FEW nexus components. This suggests that achieving multiple SDGs will require balancing societal demands in the context of finite natural resources (Jägermeyr et al., 2017; Amjath-Babu et al., 2019; Momblanch et al., 2019).Despite concluding that integrated solutions addressing the systemic connections between the FEW nexus would improve development and environmental outcomes, there are limitations of integrating multiple frameworks, both in terms of describing the complexities and in finding solutions (Leck et al., 2015; Weitz et al., 2017; Wichelns, 2017; Shannak et al., 2018). Leck et al. (2015) and Weitz et al. (2017) indicate that evidence of successful implementation and improved outcomes based on the application of nexus concepts is rare.
