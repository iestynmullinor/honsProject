Government policies in colonial and postcolonial India invested in infrastructure, export production and synthetic input use (Gupta, 1998; Davis, 2001), setting the stage for current development trajectories and closing out other adaptive options. Although such policies increased national food production, they failed to address high levels of malnutrition, worsening regional inequities, degraded natural resources and an agrarian debt crisis (Singh, 2000; Gupta et al., 2016; Gajjar et al., 2019). Agricultural livelihoods are increasingly considered unviable, with lower adaptive capacity of farmers, high debt levels (Gupta et al., 2016), and Indigenous and local knowledge loss and denigration (Kumar, 2016) alongside lower crop diversification (Srivastava et al., 2016). Government institutions aimed at infrastructure often lack adaptive capacity needed to address rural livelihoods (Singh et al., 2017; Gajjar et al., 2019).Adaptation options that consider adverse effects for different groups reduce the risk increasing vulnerability, negatively affecting socioeconomic factors to deal with climate impacts, or impeding efforts to implement SDGs (high confidence) (Juhola et al., 2016; Antwi-Agyei et al., 2018; Paprocki and Huq, 2018; Holsman et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019b; Stringer et al., 2020). Adaptation methods considering historical roots of current vulnerabilities can identify viable solutions, which are difficult to undertake because of path dependencies (high confidence) (Ribot, 2014; Albizua et al., 2019; Gajjar et al., 2019; Paprocki, 2019; Thomas, 2020). Planning techniques that model outcomes for different groups from different adaptation options could be put in place to diminish maladaptation risks (Rodríguez et al., 2019).Inclusive planning initiatives such as community-based anticipatory adaptation combined with ‘two-way learning’ that considers future scenarios and different adaptation pathways can prevent maladaptation (high confidence) (Dovie, 2017; Bezner Kerr et al., 2019; Neset et al., 2019a; Rahman and Hickey, 2019; Work et al., 2019; Butler et al., 2020; Nunn et al., 2020; Piggott-McKellar et al., 2020; Westoby et al., 2020; Table 5.20). Promising policy management tools combine temporal scales and mitigation–adaptation interactions and consider political dynamics, socioeconomic impacts and trade-offs for vulnerable groups, long-term support for policy leaders, efforts to establish livelihood ‘niches’ and ongoing participatory evaluation (Dovie, 2017; Holsman et al., 2019; Rahman and Hickey, 2019; Work et al., 2019; Butler et al., 2020). A focus on the most disadvantaged groups can help small-scale producers at higher risk to prevent maladaptation (FAO, 2018c). Governance mechanisms have emerged that consider food security, socio-cultural factors, and land and water rights, using participatory, inclusive ‘two-way learning’ methods that involve vulnerable people alongside government (IPCC, 2018; Holsman et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019b; Rahman and Hickey, 2019; Butler et al., 2020).Table 5.20 |  Summary of the emerging literature on potential risks of maladaptation.Description of adaptationstrategyPotential negative impactsMaladaptation typology (1 = rebounding vulnerability, 2 = shifting, 3 = eroding SDGs) and confidence levelRegions andcountriesaffectedGroups affectedReferencesAgricultural intensification to increase productivity, in places with heavy rainfall events or rising pest/disease incidenceIncreases GHG emissions, water pollution, possible insect resistance and costs to farmers; possibly increases inequities.May constrain adaptation policy options for development pathways due to lock-ins and trade-offs which entrench inequities.1, 2, 3Robust evidence, medium agreement USA, Africa, Asia (India, China), EuropeFarmers, pastoralists/nearby communities who rely on water; small-scale farmers who cannot afford inputs; policymakers.Gajjar et al.
