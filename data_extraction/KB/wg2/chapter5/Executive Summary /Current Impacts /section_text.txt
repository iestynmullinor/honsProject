Climate change impacts are stressing agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, increasingly hindering efforts to meet human needs (high confidence1 ). Human-induced warming has slowed growth of agricultural productivity over the past 50 years in mid and low latitudes (medium confidence). Crop yields are compromised by surface ozone (high confidence). Methane emissions have negatively impacted crop yields by increasing temperatures and surface ozone concentrations (medium confidence). Warming is negatively affecting crop and grassland quality and harvest stability (high co nfidence). Warmer and drier conditions have increased tree mortality and forest disturbances in many temperate and boreal biomes (high confidence), negatively impacting provisioning services (medium confidence). Ocean warming has decreased sustainable yields of some wild fish populations (high confidence). Ocean acidification and warming have already affected farmed aquatic species (high co nfidence). {5.2.1, 5.4.1, 5.5.1, 5.6.1, 5.7.1, 5.8.1, 5.9.1}Warming has altered the distribution, growing area suitability and timing of key biological events, such as flowering and insect emergence, impacting food quality and harvest stability (high confidence). It is very likely 2  that climate change is altering the distribution of cultivated, wild terrestrial, marine and freshwater species. At higher latitudes, warming has expanded potential area but has also altered phenology (high confidence), potentially causing plant–pollinator and pest mismatches (medium confidence). At low latitude, temperatures have crossed upper tolerance thresholds, more frequently leading to heat stress (high co nfidence). {5.4.1, 5.7.4, 5.8.1, Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter , 5.12.3.4}Climate-related extremes have affected the productivity of all agricultural and fishery sectors, with negative consequences for food security and livelihoods (high confidence). The frequency of sudden food production losses has increased since at least mid-20th century on land and sea (medium evidence, high agreement ). Droughts, floods and marine heatwaves contribute to reduced food availability and increased food prices, threatening food security, nutrition and livelihoods of millions (high confidence). Droughts induced by the 2015–2016 El Niño, partially attributable to human influences (medium confidence), caused acute food insecurity in various regions, including eastern and southern Africa and the dry corridor of Central America (high confidence). In the northeast Pacific, a recent 5-year warm period impacted the migration, distribution and abundance of key fish resources (high confidence). Increasing variability in grazing systems has negatively affected animal fertility, mortality and herd recovery rates, reducing livestock keepers’ resilience (medium confidence). { 5.2.1, 5.4.1, 5.4.2, 5.5.2,5.8.1, 5.9.1, 5.12.1, 5.14.2, 5.14.6, Cross-Chapter Box MOVING PLATE this chapter; WGI AR6 Sections 11.2–11.8}Climate change impacts everybody, but vulnerable groups, such as women, children, low-income households, Indigenous or other minority groups and small-scale producers, are often at higher risk of malnutrition, livelihood loss, rising costs and competition over resources (high confidence). Increasing competition for land, energy and water exacerbates impacts of climate change on food security (high confidence). {5.4.2.2, 5.5.2.6; 5.8.2.2, 5.9.2.1, 5.12.2, 5.12.3.1; 5.12.3.2; 5.12.3.3; 5.13.1, 5.13.3, 5.13.4}
