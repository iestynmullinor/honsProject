The World Health Organization lists traditional medicine as an essential component of culturally appropriate healthcare (WHO, 2013). Medicinal plants make up the primary source of medicine for 70â€“95% of people in low- and middle-income countries and are used widely in wealthier countries (Applequist et al., 2020). Continued use of medicinal plants ensures millions of rural people have access to effective treatments for day-to-day illness and infection and thus improves their health and resilience to climate change.Indigenous Peoples largely depend on medicinal plants for their healthcare need in different parts of the world (de Boer and Cotingting, 2014; Silva et al., 2020). Medicinal and aromatic plants can support the economy and generate livelihood options for rural people through preparing and selling traditional medicine; collecting from wild; and trade for income generation (Fajinmi et al., 2017; Zahra et al., 2020). Income from medicinal plant collection increases livelihood diversification, which is widely accepted to improve resilience.
