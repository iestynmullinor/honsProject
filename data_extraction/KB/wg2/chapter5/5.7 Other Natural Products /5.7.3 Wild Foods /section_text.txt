Wild foods can include both native and introduced species that are not cultivated or reared but may be under various degrees of management by humans and may include escapees of species that are cultivated in some contexts (Powell et al., 2015). Information on the use and importance of wild foods for nutrition is growing but remains limited (FAO, 2019e). The AR4 covered wild food briefly in the polar regions and noted the inter-related nature of climate change and Indigenous knowledge loss in reducing access to wild food (Anisimov et al., 2001). AR5 did not address wild foods and other natural products. There is large variation in the importance of wild foods (Powell et al., 2015; Rowland et al., 2017; Dop et al., 2020). A recent survey of 91 countries found that 15 reported regular use of wild foods by most of the population, and 26 reported regular use of wild foods by a subsection of the population (FAO, 2019e). While they contribute little to food energy intake, their contribution to nutrition can be significant because most wild and forest foods (vegetables, fruits, mushrooms, insects and meat) are rich in proteins and micronutrients (Powell et al., 2015). The impacts of climate change on wild foods will vary in time and space and among species.
