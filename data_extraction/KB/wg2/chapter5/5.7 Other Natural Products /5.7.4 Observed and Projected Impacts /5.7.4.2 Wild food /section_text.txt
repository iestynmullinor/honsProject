Wild foods are important to many communities that live in and adjacent to humid tropical forests, but climate change impacts are mixed (Table 5.10, Dounias et al., 2007; Colfer, 2008; Powell et al., 2015; Rowland et al., 2017; Reyes-Garc√≠a et al., 2019). In some humid tropical forest regions, bushmeat is particularly important (Golden et al., 2011; Nasi et al., 2011; Fa et al., 2015; Powell et al., 2015; Rowland et al., 2017). In humid tropical regions, the impact of climate change on wild food availability, access and consumption is currently unclear and research is limited. There are, however, important interrelationships between climate change and wild food use in humid forests. For example, the loss of large mammals to bushmeat consumption and global trade will likely slow the regeneration of tropical forests in which a large number of tree species are dependent on large mammals for seed dispersal (Brodie and Gibbs, 2009). Conversely, others argue that bushmeat provides local communities with an important incentive to support local maintenance of forest cover and, thus, carbon sequestration (Bennett et al., 2007).
