Wild foods are also impacted by climate change in arid and semi-arid landscapes around the world (medium evidence, high agreement ) (Table 5.10). A number of wild species are important traditional foods of Indigenous Peoples or local communities across arid regions of North America (Messer, 1972; Kuhnlein and Calloway, 1977; Santos-Fita et al., 2012; Vinyeta et al., 2016), South America (e.g., Argentina; Ladio and Lozada, 2004; Altrichter, 2006; Eyssartier et al., 2011), Australia (Scelza et al., 2014), the Mediterranean Basin (Hadjichambis et al., 2008; Powell et al., 2014), India and the Himalayas (Pingle, 1975; Gupta and Sen, 1980; Delang, 2006; Bhatt et al., 2017).Wild foods such as baobab, shea and nere from plants and animals make an important contribution to diets and nutrition in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa (Boedecker et al., 2014; Leßmeister et al., 2015; Bélanger and Pilling, 2019) and are being impacted by climate change (Moseley et al., 2015; Sango and Godwell, 2015; Hitchcock, 2016) (see Chapter 9). There has been little published research on the impacts of climate change on wild food in arid regions of Australia, although Aboriginal elders in one report suggested that climate-related changes are impacting wild food (Memmott et al., 2013).
