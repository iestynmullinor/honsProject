Changes to the availability, abundance, access and storage of wild foods associated with changing climate are exacerbating high rates of food insecurity (high confidence) (Ford, 2009; Beaumier and Ford, 2010; Herman-Mercer et al., 2019). Wild foods are central to the food systems of communities throughout the Arctic and sub-Arctic (Kuhnlein et al., 1996; Ballew et al., 2006; Kuhnlein and Receveur, 2007; Johnson et al., 2009) and play an essential role in people’s physical and emotional health (Section CCP6.2.5; 2.8) (high confidence) (Loring and Gerlach, 2009; Cunsolo Willox et al., 2012). Wild foods consumed in the Arctic and northern regions include animals and a wide variety of plant foods (Wein et al., 1996; Ballew et al., 2006; Kuhnlein and Receveur, 2007). Wild foods contribute most of important nutrients in the diets of northern and Arctic people (Johnson et al., 2009; Wesche and Chan, 2010; Kenny et al., 2018). However, the use of traditional wild foods is declining across the region, lowering diet quality (Rosol et al., 2016). Indigenous communities in the Arctic perceive climate change related impacts on traditional wild foods, and availability and access to wild foods are forecast to continue to decline (Brinkman et al., 2016). Some communities hold positive views of the new opportunities a warmer climate will bring, seeing them as a favourable trade-off relative to the loss of some forms of subsistence hunting (Nuttall, 2009). Climate change is causing ecological changes that impact Arctic wild food availability and abundance in many different ways, including changes to breeding success, migration patterns and food webs (Table 5.10, Markon et al., 2018).Table 5.10 | Observed and predicted impacts of climate change on selected wild food species.RegionSpeciesObserved and projected impacts of climate changeAssessment of evidence and level of agreementArctic regionRinged seals(Pusahispida)Drastic declines in population size and major changes in population structure (Hammill, 2009; Reimer et al., 2019); habitat (dependent on snow cover or ice breathing holes for lairs) will decline by approximately 70%, and significantly reduce survival rates of pups (Freitas et al., 2008).High confidenceArctic regionBearded seal (Erignathus barbatus)Climate change affects the availability and stability of at least 11 ice-associated species, including bearded seal. Potential impacts due to climate change will reduce available habitat for birthing (Moore and Huntington, 2008; Fink, 2017).Medium evidence, high agreement Arctic regionWalrus(Odobenus rosmarus)Declines in the climate-vulnerable Pacific walrus populations, induced by overharvesting (Taylor et al., 2018); however, the species is considered highly vulnerable to loss of sea ice (Lydersen, 2018). Possible diet changes (related to climate-induced changes in food web) raise concerns about the health of the population (Clark et al., 2019).High confidenceArctic regionNarwhal(Monodon monoceros)The impacts of climate change on other sea ice-associated marine mammals are somewhat less clear (Moor et al., 2017). Climate change may threaten narwhal given their vulnerability to ice entrapment (Laidre and Heide-Jorgensen, 2005) and the narrow range of prey in their diet (Heide-Jørgensen, 2018). In Greenland, hunters report that narwhal now frequent fjords and other areas where manoeuvring a boat is difficult (Nuttall, 2017).Low evidence, medium agreement Arctic regionBeluga(Delphinapterus leucas)Belugas are thought to be less sensitive to climate change than some other sea mammals but can perish in large groups from ice entrapment. Climate impacts likely increased human activity (noise) (O’Corry-Crowe, 2009). Changes in migrating timing have been documented (Hsiang et al., 2017).Low evidence, low agreement Arctic regionBowhead(Balaena mysticetus)The movements of some whale species are linked to SSTs (Moore and Huntington, 2008; Chambault et al., 2018). Some whale hunting communities are now reporting that whales pass by at a time of year when launching boats is impaired by rough weather and poor sea ice conditions (Noongwook et al., 2007; Huntington et al., 2017).Medium confidenceArctic regionOther sea ice associated marine mammals (harp seal, hooded seal)The impacts of climate change on other sea ice associated marine mammals are somewhat less clear (Moor et al., 2017).Low confidenceArctic and northern regionsReindeer and caribou(Rangifer tarandus)Large herbivores are highly dependent on their food sources such as mosses, lichens and grasses which are sensitive to climate change (Istomin and Habeck, 2016).Combined impacts of climate change and other inter-related factors suggest significant declines in caribou and reindeer populations, although to varying extents from one population to another (Kenny et al., 2018; Mallory and Boyce, 2018).Warming has led to increased plant productivity and associated increases in body mass of some reindeer populations (Albon et al., 2017; Mallory and Boyce, 2018).Increasing primary production, warming will also change the plant composition, leading to increases in woody/shrubby vegetation which will have negative nutritional consequences for caribou and reindeer (Elmendorf et al., 2012; Mallory and Boyce, 2018). The loss of lichens, a key winter food source, due to increased wildfire or replacement by grasses and herbs that die back in the winter, may also be detrimental to caribou and reindeer, although there is currently no consensus on this among experts (Mallory and Boyce, 2018).Rain on snow and icing events during winter, which are predicted to become more frequent, have been documented to lead to large increases in arctic herbivore mortality because they create an ice barrier making access to food more difficult (Putkonen and Roe, 2003; Tyler, 2010; Stien et al., 2012; Hansen et al., 2013; Forbes et al., 2016). Rain-on-snow events may also impact reproductive success, although recent research suggests this relationship in not straightforward (Douhard et al., 2016).Increased summer insect harassment is also predicted to increase and further stress large herbivores both by the additional parasitic load and by decreasing the amount of time spent grazing as animals seek to outrun pests (Mallory and Boyce, 2018).Finally, many caribou and reindeer populations rely on sea and freshwater ice to facilitate their movement and migration; loss of ice may make some populations no longer viable (Mallory and Boyce, 2018).Medium confidenceArctic and northern regionsMoose (Alces alces)The distributional changes of Rangifer populations might be affected by the range expansions and the northward expansion of moose (Mallory and Boyce, 2018). This is due to increases in productivity on the tundra and more frequent wildfire activity resulting in improved habitat quality for moose northward.Medium confidenceNorth AmericaGeese (Branta canadensis, Answer spp. , Branta spp. )Phenological mismatch developing between the berries and migration timing may mean that Canadian geese no longer stop near some communities (Downing and Cuerrier, 2011).Medium confidenceArctic and northern regionsBerries(Vaccinium spp. , Rubus spp.  and others)Berries are among the most important and widely consumed wild foods of plant origins in Arctic and northern regions (Vaara et al., 2013; Hupp et al., 2015; Boulanger-Lapointe et al., 2019).Berry production will be impacted by climate change, including snow cover, rainfall, soil moisture, air temperature and availability of insect pollinators (Herman-Mercer et al., 2020) and possible risk from sea-level-rise-associated soil salinisation (Cozzetto et al., 2013).Increased growth of woody shrub vegetation, driven by increased temperatures, can also make moving across the land difficult, impairing access to berry patches (Boulanger-Lapointe et al., 2019). Conversely, a recent modelling experiment suggested that the >2°C warming experienced by Arctic communities over the past three decades has had minimal impact on overall trail access (Ford et al., 2019).In Alaska, communities perceive berry abundance as declining and/or becoming more variable (Kellogg et al., 2010; Hupp et al., 2015). In a Gwich’in community in Canada, Parlee and Berkes (2005) recorded that local women perceived climate change, especially extreme weather events, as the greatest risk to traditional berry patches (cranberry, blueberry and cloudberry).The expansion of trees and shrubs may cause shading and negatively impact the productivity of berry plants (Downing and Cuerrier, 2011; Lévesque et al., 2012).Berries are predicted to be increasingly susceptible to negative impacts of invasive species (which compete for pollinators) (Spellman and Swenson, 2012) and infections (Turner and Clifton, 2009) as climate change progresses. Suitable area of huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum) would shrink by 5–40% by the end of the 21st century (Prevéy et al., 2020).Phenological shifts are also important. Many communities report changes in phenology including failed ripening or ‘all of the berries are ripening at the same time’ (Turner and Clifton, 2009; Herman-Mercer et al., 2020). Competition with growing populations of geese is viewed by many communities to be an important threat to berry harvesting. (Boulanger-Lapointe et al., 2019). In Labrador, Canada, changes in permafrost, vegetation, water and weather have had an impact on cloudberry (bakeapple) productivity, phenology and patch fragmentation. Moreover, changes in summer settlement patterns (which are now farther from berry patches) are making it more difficult for people to respond to variations in growth and timing (Anderson et al., 2018).In Montana, USA, Crow Nation elders have noted that many of their important berry resources have been impacted by climate change, either because they bud earlier and are then vulnerable to cold snaps, or the timing of fruit production has changed (with many now ripening at the same time) (Doyle et al., 2013). Similarly, the Wabanaki Nations in Maine and Eastern Canada worry that climate change will impact berry resources already under pressure from dwindling territory and pollution (Lynn et al., 2013).High confidenceNorth America (Washington State, USA)Salmon (Salmonidae)Indigenous communities in Washington State, USA report devastation of their salmon fishery due to loss of glacial run off and associated warming river and stream temperatures; potential damage to shellfish resources due to sea level rise and ocean acidification (Lynn et al., 2013). The Karuk people in California have also experienced losses in salmon (Lynn et al., 2013; Vinyeta et al., 2016).Medium confidenceNorth America (California)Acorns from oak trees (Querus)  In the arid southwest of the USA, wild foods are less widely consumed today, but their revitalisation is important to identity and well-being of many Indigenous People. The Karuk people of the Klamath River in California have experienced an almost complete loss of two key traditional wild foods: salmon and acorns, foods which once made up 50% of a traditional Karuk diet (Lynn et al., 2013; Vinyeta et al., 2016), as well as huckleberry (Vinyeta et al., 2016). Using regional climate models, Kueppers (2005) showed a major reduction in the range of two species of oak in California that are used in traditional diets. Increasing frequency of severe fires in the western USA threaten a number of traditional wild food resources, especially acorns (Vinyeta et al., 2016).Medium confidenceNorth AmericaWild rice(Zizania spp.)Significant reductions in wild rice area in Great Lakes have been associated with mining, dams and other activities, but climate change may lead to further reductions (Cozzetto et al., 2013; Lynn et al., 2013).High confidenceNorth AmericaCamas tuber(Camassia quamash)Historic changes in fire regimes, linked to changes in climate, are believed to have altered availability of the important camas tuber (Camassia quamash) (Lepofsky et al., 2005).Medium confidenceNorth AmericaWapato tuber(Sagittaria latifolia)The aquatic Sagittaria latifolia (the roots of which are consumed by Indigenous groups across North America) is vulnerable to both water salinity and temperature (Delesalle and Blum, 1994).Medium confidenceNorth AmericaSpringbeauty  (Claytonia lanceolate)Claytonia lanceolata is particularly vulnerable to changes in snow melt and other climatic changes owing to advancement in the flowering (Renner and Zohner, 2018).Medium confidenceNorth AmericaSeaweed (Porphyra abbottiae,  among others)In British Columbia, Canada, Indigenous People Gitga’at elders noted that the ripening of an important edible seaweed (Porphyra abbottiae) had rarely synchronised with weather patterns that enabled them to process it in the traditional way (drying on rocks and then ripening and re-drying) (Turner and Clifton, 2009).Low confidenceAfricaBaobab (Adansonia digitata)Baobab is thought to be vulnerable to climate change because it is long-lived, it can take up to 23 years to start fruiting and leaf harvesting is often so intensive that it depresses fruit production. Modelling study using different records model shows that the percentage of present distribution predicted to be suitable in the future ranged from 5% to 91% (Sanchez et al., 2011).Low confidenceAfricaShea (Vitellaria paradoxa)Shea (Vitellaria paradoxa) was expanded through human intervention and is linked to human migration; fruit traits such as fruit size and shape, pulp sweetness and kernel fat content are determined both by temperature and rainfall, as well as human selection for preferred traits (Maranz and Wiesman, 2003). There is limited and conflicting evidence of the impacts of climatic conditions and future projected climate variations on V. paradoxa (Tom-Dery et al., 2018). Mixed evidence of the impact of climate and rainfall on fruit production and timing is reported (Tom-Dery et al., 2018). Fruit production was negatively correlated with mean annual temperature and positively correlated with annual rainfall (Bondé et al., 2019).Limited evidence, medium agreement North Africa(Morocco)Argan (Argania spinosa)Climate change projections suggest a 32% decrease in habitat suitable for Argania spinosa under some scenarios (Alba-Sánchez et al., 2015; Moukrim et al., 2019).Medium confidenceAsia (Nepal)Fruit species and vegetables (e.g., Asparagus racemosus, Urticadioica)In Nepal, Thapa (2015) reports phenological changes in semi-domesticated fruit species, as well as decreased availability of a number of wild plants that can be consumed as vegetables.Limited evidence, medium agreement Worldwide, most important in Europe and AsiaMushroomsWild mushrooms production (including truffles) is closely linked to climate factors including temperature and precipitation as well as tree growth and carbohydrate production (Tahvanainen et al., 2016). Some species are sensitive to high temperatures (Büntgen et al., 2012; Le Tacon et al., 2014; Ágreda et al., 2015; Bradai et al., 2015; Taye et al., 2016; Alday et al., 2017; Karavani et al., 2018; Büntgen et al., 2019; Thomas and Buntgen, 2019). Models for some varieties suggest ‘declines of 78–100% in European truffle production are likely for 2071–2100’ (Thomas and Buntgen, 2019). For some species in northern Europe, the season is expanding (starting earlier and/or ending later), likely linked to warming (Büntgen et al., 2012; Le Tacon et al., 2014; Ágreda et al., 2015; Bradai et al., 2015; Taye et al., 2016; Alday et al., 2017; Karavani et al., 2018; Büntgen et al., 2019; Thomas and Buntgen, 2019).Matsutake mushroom (Tricholoma matsutake), highly prized in China, is sensitive to timing and amount of precipitation and temperature (Yang et al., 2012), and suitable habitat for this species is predicted to significantly decrease and highly suitable habitat to nearly disappear under various climate change scenarios (Guo et al., 2017).High confidenceNorth America(California)Acorns, nuts and berries and other fire-dependent wild foodsLow-intensity traditional burning practices increased pyro-diversity (Vinyeta et al., 2016). Climate change will exacerbate the risks posed by exotic pathogens that attack oak species and further reduce access to acorns as well as other foods founds in oak ecosystems (Voggesser et al., 2013).High confidenceSouth America (Amazon region)Aguaje, (Mauritia felxuosa), Brazilian nut (Bertholletiaexcelsa), fishing and hunting in generalLocal communities perceived a lower yield of aguaje due to drought (Hofmeijer et al., 2013). In another study from the Colombian Amazon, wild food use was reported to be vulnerable to extreme climate events which impact species migration patterns or restrict access to fishing and hunting rounds (Torres-Vitolas et al., 2019). In some humid regions, the range of some wild food species may be extended by climate change, such as the Brazilian nut (Bertholletiaexcelsa) (Thomas et al., 2014).Medium confidenceSmall islands (Papua New Guinea)Sweet potatoIncreases in the ENSO were associated with drought which increased sweet potato losses (Jacka, 2016) in highlands humid forest.Limited evidence, medium agreement Australasia (Australia)General wild foodsAboriginal communities in North Queensland, a humid tropical region of northern Australia, reported some climate impacts on wild foods, although primarily for marine resources and those found in dry forest ecosystems (McIntyre-Tamwoy et al., 2013).Limited evidence, medium agreement Asia (Indonesia)Sago (Metroxylon sagu)People in a sago-dependent community in Papua Indonesia viewed climate variation as less important than other factors (logging, mining, infrastructure), but still expressed concerns about salinity of water supplies, floods and reduced hunting success (Boissière et al., 2013).Limited evidence, medium agreement Climate-change-induced impacts of access to wild foods are also of concern in Arctic regions (high confidence). Coastal and inland communities of Alaska found that 60% of climate impacts on food security listed by hunters were related to access (Brinkman et al., 2016). Reduced duration, thickness and quality of sea ice are some of the most cited impacts of climate change on wild food consumption (Ford, 2009; Laidler et al., 2009; Downing and Cuerrier, 2011; Huntington et al., 2017; Nuttall, 2017; Fawcett et al., 2018; Ford et al., 2018; Markon et al., 2018). Lack of snowfall reduces and delays the ability to travel on land using snowmobiles (Downing and Cuerrier, 2011), impacting safety of travel, time needed and costs of accessing wild foods (Cold et al., 2020).Rising temperatures and humidity are also impacting wild food storage and increasing the risk of food-borne diseases (Cozzetto et al., 2013; Nuttall, 2017; Markon et al., 2018). Changes in AT and humidity can mean that whale and fish meat no longer dry properly, or meat may spoil before hunters can get it home (Downing and Cuerrier, 2011; Nuttall, 2017). Traditional permafrost ice cellars are no longer reliable (Downing and Cuerrier, 2011; Nyland et al., 2017; Herman-Mercer et al., 2019). Climate-related environmental change compounded with social, economic, cultural and political change have had complex but overall negative impacts on wild foods (Section CCP6.4, Lujan et al., 2018) .Communities across other (non-Arctic) parts of North America and Europe also report declining availability of wild foods, with climate change among the perceived drivers for decline (medium confidence) (Table 5.10, Serrasolses et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2019a). Even when climate change may not always be the primary driver of loss of these wild food resources, climate may interact with other stressors to exacerbate loss of wild foods (Lynn et al., 2013; Reo and Parker, 2013).
