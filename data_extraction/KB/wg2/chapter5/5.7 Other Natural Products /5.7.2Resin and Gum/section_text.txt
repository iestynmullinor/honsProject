Resin and gum are economically important natural products, contributing 14–23% total household income in parts of Ethiopia and Sudan (Abtew et al., 2014; Fikir et al., 2016), Cambodia (Sakkhamduang et al.) and India (Tewari et al., 2017). They are an important source of raw material for many industries. For instance, in Africa, the genera Boswellia and Commiphora,  which provide frankincense and myrrh resins, provide significant income generation and export value (Tilahun et al., 2015). Populations of many species that provide gums and resins are declining under pressure from unsustainable harvesting and deforestation, and climate change may threaten them further.In Sri Lanka, Boswellia serrataRoxb. is critically endangered or possibly extinct (Weerakoon and Wijesundara 2012). In India, B. serrata populations are ‘vulnerable’ (Chaubey et al., 2015; Brendler et al., 2018), and declining in the Western Ghats (Soumya et al., 2019). Invasion of Lantana camara and Prosopis juliflora has resulted in poor regeneration of Commiphorawightii in central India (Jain and Nadgauda, 2013). Other resin-producing species under threat include: Daemonoropsdraco (dragon’s blood resin) in Indonesia (Yetty et al., 2013; Widianingsih et al., 2019), Pinus merkusii (tusam) in Sumatra (Indonesia) (Hartiningtias et al., 2020), Pinus pinaster in Spain, Pinus massoniana in China  (Génova et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015b) and Pistacia atlantica in Iran (Yousefi et al., 2020).
