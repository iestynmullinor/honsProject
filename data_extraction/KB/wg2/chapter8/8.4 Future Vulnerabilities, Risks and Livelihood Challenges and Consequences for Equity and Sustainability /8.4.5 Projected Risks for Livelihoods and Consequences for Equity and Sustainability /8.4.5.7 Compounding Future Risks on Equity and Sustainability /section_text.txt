The compounding future effects on equity and sustainability emerge when multiple stressors linked to environmental and/or climate change, together with underlying structural poverty, exclusion, marginalisation, and conflicts creating risks that need to be addressed simultaneously. Compounding risks of climate change received attention in AR5 (Oppenheimer et al., 2014). This included risks associated with compound hazards (O’Neill et al., 2017b) and their implications for future risk when repeated impacts erode human and ecosystem capacity, including through transboundary effects. In SRCCL (IPCC, 2019a), land degradation and climate change compounded to highly expose the livelihoods of the poor to climate hazards and caused food insecurity (high confidence), migration, conflict and loss of cultural heritage (low confidence) (Olsson et al., 2019).The evidence of compounded risks emerges from specific climate and environmental hazards, as in relation to heatwaves, droughts, altered precipitation regimes and increasing aridity, cyclones, floods, hurricanes and wildfires (Table 8.7). Other evidence shows that the structural poverty and socioeconomic inequalities (Lusseau and Mancini, 2019), disability (Sun et al., 2017), corruption (Markkanen, 2019) and isolation (Reyer et al., 2017) (Table 8.7) compound to amplify climate risks among rural and urban poor, smallholder farms, coastal settlements, with health impacts on children’s development (Perera, 2017) and urban elderly (Sun et al., 2017). In Tanzania, a greater exposure of households to climate change impacts and risks is associated with increasing land value and variable tenure, compounded by declining farm yields, accelerating the negative effects among the population (Röschel et al., 2018). In India, extreme droughts and heatwaves compound extreme poverty and high dependence on agriculture for income and food production will affect crop productivity, income and food prices among smallholder farms (Singh and Leua, 2017). In Mozambique, soil degradation and fertility, compounded by incidence of droughts, increase the vulnerability of already poor smallholders who lack access to technological advances for crop yield management and drought-resistant crops (Kidane et al., 2019).Table 8.7 | Effects of compounded risks on the poor.

In the Global South, over 880 million people are living in precarious and informal conditions without access to water and sanitation, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (see Chapter 6; Rosenzweig et al., 2018; Satterthwaite et al., 2018; Tusting et al., 2019). In rapidly urbanising sub-Saharan African countries, around 53 (50–57) million urban inhabitants (50% of urban population ) and 595 (585–607) million rural inhabitants (82% of the rural population) were still living in unimproved housing in 2015 (Tusting et al., 2019).L&D from climate extremes, such as fatalities or economic losses due to droughts or floods (see also Figure 8.6) also matter for future vulnerability and risk, since the poorest segments of society take longer to recover after shocks (Gupta and Sharma, 2006; van der Geest, 2018). In some cases, poor households might never be able to fully recover post-disaster, especially in the context of increasing global temperature increase (van der Geest, 2018). Another example of compounding effects of climate change to equity and sustainability is migration, which is underpinned by the underlying socioeconomic and political context of vulnerability (see Section 8.2).In Latin America, compounding effects of climate change impacts (disasters) and armed conflict has contributed to forced migration to the point that in 2018 alone, 1.7 million people migrated due to extreme events, four times as many as the number of people leaving their homeland due to armed conflict (Serraglio and Schraven, 2019). In South America, migration within and between countries can stem from climate extremes, primarily felt by the poorest and marginalised (by gender, age, ethnicity) populations that might not be able to adapt to the fast pace and scale of changes at the local level (Maru et al., 2014; Pinho et al., 2015; Serraglio and Schraven, 2019). In mountain regions, intersections of people’s marginalisation, difficulty in access and environmental sensitivity in the context of incidence of climate extremes have combined to reduce the ability of mountain agro-pastoralists to cope with climate extremes (Mishra et al., 2019). Mountain ecosystems are also highly susceptible to disasters and disturbances, which can lead to irreversible loss and challenge poverty reduction efforts (Mishra et al., 2019) Some risks associated with the degradation and loss of habitats and ecosystem services associated with land use changes and commodities in many countries have compounding impacts on equity and sustainability, associated with permanent losses to the livelihoods of poor and marginalised groups, such as Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities around the world (Roy et al., 2018). For instance, high deforestation rates and increased forest burning in many Amazonian countries are further exposing vulnerable Indigenous Peoples and traditional populations to health problems, crop failures and shortages of freshwater supply, especially in the context of extreme droughts and non-supportive governance (Leal Filho et al., 2020a; Walker et al., 2020).Overall, there is increasing evidence that the compounding effects of climate hazards intertwined with dimensions of poverty, environmental degradation and inequalities, represent a key risk to equity and sustainability among poor and vulnerable populations (medium evidence and high agreement ). Compounding risks—compared to compounding hazards—can also be significantly influenced by societal tipping points and by different factors of human vulnerability that determine underlying destabilisation processes of societies and communities exposed to climate change, including issues of governance.
