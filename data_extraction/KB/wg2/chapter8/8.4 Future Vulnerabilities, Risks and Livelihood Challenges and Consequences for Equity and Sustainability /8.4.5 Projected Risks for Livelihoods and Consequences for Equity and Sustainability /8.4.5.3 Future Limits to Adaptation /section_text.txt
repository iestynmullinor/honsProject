Local perceptions of losses from adverse effects of climate variability and change can help to assess the magnitude of impacts that individuals and communities have not been able to cope with or adapt to (James et al., 2014; Barnett et al., 2016; McNamara and Jackson, 2019 McNamara et al. 2021, Mecheler et al. 2020).The IPCC Special Report on a 1.5°C warming world shows with high confidence that for the Arctic systems, if average temperature increase exceeds 1.5°C by the end of the century limits to adaptation and residual impacts will be exceeded, compromising people’s livelihoods (Ford et al., 2015; O’Neill et al., 2017b; Roy et al., 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2019a). The loss and degradation of the Amazon forest with global warming temperatures beyond 1.5°C is another clear example of irreversible loss, with significant impact to people’s livelihoods today and in the future (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2018). Moreover, the L&D from climate change impacts are also felt heavily by women, children and elderly given the intersectionality with socioeconomic and gender inequalities (Li et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2018). For instance, gender and wealth inequality offers challenges to scale up the Maasai pastoralist community autonomous adaptive practices (Wangui and Smucker, 2018). This study found that most female-headed and poorest households could not access the land, water for irrigation and financial assets required to access adaptive practices that are available in the wider community. Consequently, future impacts of climate change are likely  to increase rather than decrease inequality based on already observed impacts on adaptive capacities that constrain future adaptation options, particularly for the poor (Roy et al., 2018).
