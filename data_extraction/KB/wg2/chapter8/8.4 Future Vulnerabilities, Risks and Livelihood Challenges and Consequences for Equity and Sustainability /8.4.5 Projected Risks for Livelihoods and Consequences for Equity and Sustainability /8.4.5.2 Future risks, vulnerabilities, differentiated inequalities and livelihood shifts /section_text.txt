Overall, there is high agreement  that future climate change impacts are going to worsen poverty and exacerbate inequalities within and between nations, with projections that by 2030 these will increase significantly (Olsson et al., 2014; Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 2017; Roy et al., 2018). In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences linked to measures to reduce the spreading of the virus are likely  to increase poverty, particularly in regions already facing high levels of vulnerability and poverty (Laborde et al., 2020b; Sumner et al., 2020).Key risks due to future climate change, exposure and vulnerability are difficult to assess and are based on evidence from the past and likely  future vulnerabilities and livelihood challenges. The assessment of Representative Key Risks (see Section 16.5.2.3.4) underscores that risks to living standards are potentially severe as measured by the magnitude of impacts in comparison to historical events or as inferred from the number of people currently vulnerable (see in detail Chapter 16). Table 8.4 provides an overview of what is known in the literature assessed about future risks, inequalities and particularly future vulnerabilities, including potential challenges for climate justice and adaptation barriers. For example, barriers for gender, ethnicity and class have been addressed for a long time yet need substantive intervention. Gender, along with many other structural inequalities (Table 8.4) that are deeply rooted, pose future threats to people and groups in vulnerable situations from, for example, the loss of land or assets, exposure to extreme events and so on. These people will also likely  be highly exposed to future climate risks unless there are significant and new avenues for action on climate change now. For example, recent studies suggest that the total population of all countries classified as most highly vulnerable is projected to grow significantly. A study using five vulnerability categories globally concludes that the total population of all countries with very high vulnerability (see Figure 8.6) is projected to increase from 2019 numbers approximately by 102% by 2050 (i.e., roughly double) and 257% by 2100, while the population of all countries with very low vulnerability is projected to decrease by 9% by 2050 and 17% by 2100 (based on UN medium probabilistic projections). Another study estimates that the total population of all countries classified at most vulnerable (top two categories; using seven vulnerability categories globally) is predicted to increase by 82% by 2050 and 192% by 2100. In contrast the population of all countries classified as least vulnerable (bottom two categories) is projected to only increase by 9% by 2050 and 1% by 2100 (see in detail UN-DESA, 2019; Birkmann et al., 2021a; Birkmann et al., 2022).Table 8.4 |  Summary of interlocking categories differentiation future risks, vulnerabilities, inequality and adaptationFuture risksInequalitiesFuture vulnerabilities, future livelihood, future exposure (examples)ReferencesIncreasing risk of displacement and damage to women and girls in floodsGender inequality leaves women and girls hidden, forgotten and exposed, resulting in displacement impacts and limited resources, including social capital and increasing risk of human trafficking.Increasing future vulnerability of women and girls due to high hazard exposure; gender differentiated vulnerability to urban flooding (in India); increasing risk of human trafficking associated with exposure to future extreme events.(Singh, 2020; CCB GENDER in Chapter 18)Increasing risks of exacerbating inequalities and tensionsDifferentiation based on ethnicity and race leads to groups in society being less visible, with fewer rights, particularly for livelihoods that expose them to extremes.

If tenurial status is unclear, groups may experience loss of land and displacement.Section 8.2; Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18.That means that, based on current population growth estimates and if vulnerability levels are not reduced significantly, more people will be living in more vulnerable context conditions in the future compared to those living in less vulnerable contexts. This is independent of the development of climatic hazard exposure. If significant reductions of vulnerability are achieved, this projection will change. However, the vulnerability and poverty of some regions and countries, such as Afghanistan or Haiti, has proved over decades to be persistent. Consequently, the estimated future population growth is another factor that points towards the urgent need to reduce vulnerability and to narrow the adaptation gap.While future adaptation options can also encompass measures or tools that emerge in future, most of the future adaptation options and their relevance for reducing vulnerability, poverty and inequality are known. Evidence exists that the importance of social networks that organise social protection and leverage resources in terms of reducing risks to climate change is increasing, particularly for most vulnerable people or groups in countries that have limited social security measures in place.
