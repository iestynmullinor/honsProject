Responses to climate change can have dual effects on development pathways. On the one hand, mitigation and adaptation processes can create significant development opportunities. The potential of mitigation policies for job creation, in particular, has been highlighted (Healy and Barry, 2017). However, responses to climate change can also have detrimental effects on future development: mitigation policies, such as the building of hydro-electrical dams or the culture of biofuels can lead to communities’ dislocation and populations’ resettlement, particularly of disadvantaged groups within a society (de Sherbinin et al., 2011; Eriksen et al., 2021). Adaptation policies can also hinder some development processes: for example, the promotion of migration as an adaptation strategy can lead to communities being deprived of their workforce and resenting the departure of some of their members (Gemenne and Blocher, 2017), even though this may offer new livelihood opportunities. However, the migration consequences in the context of climate change are often more nuanced and different trade-offs and benefits occur (see Porst and Sakdapolrak, 2020). For example, remittances support family members but, at the same time, can also create imbalances in local markets (Melde et al., 2017). Evidence exists that some climate responses, such as small-scale agricultural livelihood adaptation strategies, have improved the ability of people to sustain their livelihood and to reduce poverty (Osbahr et al., 2010).
