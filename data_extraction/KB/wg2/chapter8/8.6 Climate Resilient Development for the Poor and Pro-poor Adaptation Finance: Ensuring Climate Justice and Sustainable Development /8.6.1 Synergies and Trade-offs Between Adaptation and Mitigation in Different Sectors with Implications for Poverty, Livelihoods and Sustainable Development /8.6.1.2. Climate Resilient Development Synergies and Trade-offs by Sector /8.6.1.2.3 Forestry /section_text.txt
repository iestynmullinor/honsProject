Forests can support CRD in rural communities and households: they support consumption of energy, food and fibre, provide a safety net in cases of shocks, fill gaps during seasonal shortfalls and are a means to accumulate assets and provide support to emerge out of poverty (Angelsen et al., 2014; Adams et al., 2020). Forest ecosystems are an essential element of climate change mitigation and adaptation, with the potential for synergy and conflict between the two climate action objectives (Morecroft et al., 2019). However, there are varied perspectives on the role of the forests, with some treating conservation and forest management practices as a barrier to livelihood resilience (Few et al., 2017) despite the broader role of forest management in climate mitigation (Houghton, 2012).Forestry mitigation projects such as forest conservation, reduced deforestation, protected area management and sustainable forest management, can promote adaptation and can also have consequences for the development objectives of other sectors (e.g., expansion of farmland) (Smith et al., 2014). REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, fostering conservation and sustainable management of forest and enhancement of carbon stocks) is a payment programme that may provide adaptation benefits by enhancing households’ economic resilience (Sills et al., 2014; Duchelle et al., 2018) and also produce positive livelihood impacts through the employment benefits of supporting conservation and sustainable management of forests (Caplow et al., 2011). Furthermore, the management of ecosystem services may contribute to both mitigation and adaptation. For example, REDD+ projects, such as mangrove conservation and restoration, simultaneously contribute to carbon storage and diversification of incomes and economic activities. At the same time, mangroves protect coastal areas against flooding and hydrological variations, improving capacity for adaptation in local livelihoods (Locatelli et al., 2016). However, while studies of existing REDD+ programmes noted the moderately encouraging impacts for mitigation and small or insignificant impacts for adaptation options (especially well-being), they underscored the potentially damaging impacts to local livelihoods (Milne et al., 2019; Skutsch and Turnhout, 2020). They suggested improved engagement with local communities, increased funding to strengthen the interventions on the ground, and more attention to both mitigation and adaptation outcomes in implementation for achieving the benefits of REDD+ programme (Duchelle et al., 2018). Moreover, to effectively counter local threats to forests and biodiversity and attain positive biodiversity and development outcomes, REDD+ programmes must be focused on better institutional support for governance, coordinating interventions and monitoring of plans, as well as making explicit linkages between REDD+ activities and national biodiversity conservation efforts (Panfil and Harvey, 2016) and assuring a fair distribution of benefits to local communities (Myers et al., 2018). An analysis of country-specific REDD+ programmes in Cameroon looking at synergies of REDD+ with other national goals, such as poverty reduction, identified two principal modes of strategic interaction management among actors. The first priority relates to specific structures for designing REDD+ giving high priority to social safeguards. The second relates to programming that builds trust, communication and confidence of participants creating an environment for enabling management through commitment and behavioural interaction by creating an overarching institutional framework and unilateral management (Somorin et al., 2016).To achieve CRD, forestry conservation strategies need to be driven by climate action and forest management policies that benefit both ecological and human systems, and, above all, involve forest communities in programme and project implementation (Cordeiro-Beduschi, 2020). Synergies between mitigation and adaptation of the forestry sector can be enhanced by considering on-the-ground contexts of constraints and social trade-offs that may undermine implemented actions (Few et al., 2017). However, the lack of knowledge about trade-offs and synergies at the local level and between local and global scales makes this challenging.Despite these constraints, forestry can serve as a foundation for CRD when adaptation and mitigation activities are effectively integrated from the stage of policy formulation with consideration of specific institutional structures and procedures that can help to facilitate such integration (Locatelli et al., 2015). Effectively integrated adaptation and mitigation activities can be achieved by encouraging collaboration between the two activities, promoting research on the impacts of the integrated activities, their cost-effectiveness and their synergies within the complex setting of risks and uncertainty concerning the magnitude of climate change impacts (Bakkegaard et al., 2016), along with facilitating participation of communities in the two activities and defining forest policies (Ngum et al., 2019). Moreover, international donors and funds are also critical to guide countries to identify adaptation–mitigation synergies, through consultation processes, dialogue and awareness raising (Locatelli et al., 2016). Moreover, in order to be effective, nature-based climate solutions such as mixed species plantation, forest expansion and REDD+, must be people-centric and respond to the needs of the rural and Indigenous Peoples who manage ecosystems for their livelihoods, while at the same time supporting the biodiversity of the ecosystems (Temperton et al., 2019; Fleischman et al., 2020).
