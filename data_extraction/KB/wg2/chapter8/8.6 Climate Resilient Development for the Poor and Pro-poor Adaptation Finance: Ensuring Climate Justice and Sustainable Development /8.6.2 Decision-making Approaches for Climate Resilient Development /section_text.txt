Another important strategy to better determine impacts of adaptation and mitigation and to promote inclusivity, transparency and accountability is the community-based approach. This approach also supports adaptation and mitigation indirectly through the strengthening of capacity and social capital. For example, in Bangkalan, Indonesia, the presence of high social capacity and readily available free agricultural inputs are two decisive factors for effective climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as for enhancing community livelihood (Sunkar and Santosa, 2018). The calls to consider Indigenous knowledge and Indigenous People to support integrated strategies in adaptation and mitigation are increasing (Ford et al., 2016; Altieri and Nicholls, 2017; Brugnach et al., 2017). Detailed knowledge of local socio-ecological contexts may offer transformational processes to harness synergies (Thornton and Comberti, 2017). A study in the Ukraine on cooperatives shows that it offers a well-established livelihood strategy and means to support agriculture smallholders. Moreover, social capital fulfils key roles in the process of capacity building and implementation of sustainable measures (Kopytko, 2018). In Indonesia, a well-known programme focusing on community-led adaptation and mitigation activities is Proklim. It empowers communities to learn about climate change impacts, record data and plan actions for climate change (Muttaqin and Yulianti, 2019). Multi-stakeholder, participatory planning processes are beneficial to help farmers to screen and prioritise rural livelihood strategies in Indonesia. The necessity of CRD is reflected in standard development interventions: water management, intensification and diversification of agriculture and aquaculture, education, health, food security and skill building for farmers (Wise et al., 2016).
