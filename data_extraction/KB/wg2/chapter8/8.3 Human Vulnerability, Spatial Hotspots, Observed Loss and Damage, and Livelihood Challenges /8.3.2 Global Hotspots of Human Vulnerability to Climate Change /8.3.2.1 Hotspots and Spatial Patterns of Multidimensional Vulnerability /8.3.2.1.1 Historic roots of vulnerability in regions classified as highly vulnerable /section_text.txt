While increasing attention is given to issues of human vulnerability, less attention has been given to the historical conditions that foster systemic vulnerability of societies. It is important to acknowledge that drivers and root causes of systemic human vulnerabilities and development challenges are not always new, and sometimes—for example in various countries in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean—can be linked to histories of imperialism, colonial structures (Grasham et al., 2019), and subsequent development and governance contexts (Southard, 2017; Zhukova, 2020). Thus, root causes of present structures of human and human–environmental vulnerability often have historic dimensions, for example, chronic poverty and structural inequality in Africa (Grasham et al., 2019) or the Caribbean are still influenced by the colonial power relations outside of these countries making solutions for vulnerability reduction more difficult (see e.g., Douglass and Cooper, 2020). In addition, national borders, such as in many regions in Africa, sometimes cut through ethnic groups and therewith ignore important interrelations between communities on both sides of the border.
