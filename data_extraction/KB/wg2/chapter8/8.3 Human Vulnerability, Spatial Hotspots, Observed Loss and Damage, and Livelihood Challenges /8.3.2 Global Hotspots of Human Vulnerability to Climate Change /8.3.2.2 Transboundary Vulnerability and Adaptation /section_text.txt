Next to the identification of the level of agreement between different vulnerability assessments (Garschagen et al., 2021) and the spatial hotspots, global assessments of vulnerability and adaptation readiness also point towards the need for a transboundary perspective and transboundary cooperation in terms of vulnerability reduction and adaptation (Tilleard and Ford, 2016; Birkmann et al., 2021a). Newer research points towards the fact that various phenomena of vulnerability, particularly in highly vulnerable regions, spill over national borders and emerge in rather regional clusters, such as forced migration and poverty in West and Central Africa, as well as conflicts in the Near East and Asia (IDMC, 2020). This means that regional and transboundary challenges contribute to the formation of systemic human vulnerability, for example, forced migration that is occurring within countries, but also across international borders that is also influenced by climate change (Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020). In summary, these findings point towards the need for more transboundary approaches in vulnerability and risk reduction, adaptation and development. Recent literature and data presented in Figure 8.6 and (Birkmann and Welle, 2016; Feldmeyer et al., 2017; Hallegatte et al., 2017; INFORM, 2019; Birkmann et al., 2021a) demonstrate the need to strengthen approaches to monitor the regional dimensions of vulnerability and to develop strategies and programmes that consider transboundary vulnerability in risk reduction and cooperation at different scales. This includes, for example, cooperation between national-level institutions, but also transboundary networks of cities or communities (Tilleard and Ford, 2016; Benzie and Persson, 2019; Birkmann et al., 2021a). The transnational nature of climate change impacts means that addressing them requires concerted efforts among nations (IPCC, 2014b; Dzebo, 2019).In addition, national response strategies for specific transboundary climate-influenced hazards, such as river flooding, droughts or coastal flooding can also significantly influence neighbouring countries and can affect exposure and vulnerability of the respective country (Nadin and Roberts, 2018; Booth et al., 2020). Likewise, climate change may affect transboundary resources (e.g., underground water reserves) and transboundary ecosystems (e.g., in terms of the migration of species) (Vij et al., 2017) and thereby further reduce the capacity of vulnerable groups to cope and adapt. In addition, recent research indicates that social inequities are also coupled with access to and quality of environmental resources in urban environmentsâ€”meaning social and environmental justices are interconnected (see Schell et al., 2020).Individual adaptation projects to specific climate hazards in regions classified as highly vulnerable are needed. However, recent studies underscore that deeper development challenges need to be addressed in order to make progress towards adaptation and vulnerability reduction and to avoid maladaptation (Eriksen et al., 2021). Adaptation and development projects, such as the construction of a dam as a response to water shortages in one country can significantly influence the exposure to water shortages and the response capacities of another country downstream. Often, transboundary challenges are a result of policy and resource management choices or uncertainty, and addressing them requires a greater engagement between governing bodies, which may also guide more suitable responses in the context of climate change adaptation and vulnerability reduction (Earle et al., 2015; Tilleard and Ford, 2016; McLeman, 2018; Birkmann et al., 2021a).Most of those countries and regional clusters identified as highly vulnerable have contributed little to the overall amount of GHG emissions and therefore support for (transboundary) adaptation from the international community is required in these places and for those living under these conditions in order to support and achieve climate justice.
