Literature in the area of climate change risk management and adaptation highlights the importance of overall governance systems and their functioning and inclusiveness in terms of vulnerability and risk reduction (Burch et al., 2019). Empirical evidence and scientific studies show linkages between issues of governance, conflicts and high levels of state fragility and systemic human vulnerability (see Figure 8.8; Section 8.5.2; Ekl√∂w and Krampe, 2019; Peters et al., 2019; Mawejje and Finn, 2020)Figure 8.8 | Comparison of the vulnerability and state fragility of global regions. The vulnerability values are the average of the vulnerability component of the WorldRiskIndex 2019 (Birkmann et al., 2021a; Feldmeyer et al., 2021) and the vulnerability and lack of coping capacity components of the INFORM Risk Index 2019 (Marin-Ferrer et al., 2017) classified into five classes using the equal count method (Birkmann et al., 2022). The state fragility values are based on the Fragile States Index 2019 (FFP, 2020) and regions are based on the intermediate and sub-regions of the United Nations Statistical Division. The size of each circle is proportional to the population (World Bank, 2019b) in the respective region.Open figure The comparison of state fragility and vulnerability at the level of regions (United Nations Statistics Division regions) based on the vulnerability information of the INFORM and WorldRiskIndex systems and information from the Failed State Index indicates clear linkages (see Figure 8.8), meaning that societal development and governance challenges often interact and, in many cases, are influenced by complex histories (see FFP, 2020; Birkmann et al., 2021a; Feldmeyer et al., 2021). Strategies to reduce systemic vulnerability and multidimensional poverty have to account for these broader governance challenges that hamper resilience building and the development of adaptive capacities to climate change at various levels.Strategies to strengthen adaptation to climate change have therefore to acknowledge these interdependencies between climate change, vulnerability, development and governance (see Section 8.6.5). The results of different global vulnerability assessments and the role of governance conditions underscore that next to individual adaptation projects in specific sectors, integrated strategies and programmes are needed that reduce systemic vulnerability and support enabling conditions for adaptation for most vulnerable groups (see Section 8.6.5).
