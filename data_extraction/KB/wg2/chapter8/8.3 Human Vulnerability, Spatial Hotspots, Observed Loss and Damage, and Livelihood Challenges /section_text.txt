Nature of the droughtBetween 2015 and 2017, the Western Cape region experienced an unprecedented three consecutive years of below average rainfall, leading to acute water shortages, most prominently in the city of Cape Town (Sousa et al., 2018). Anthropogenic climate change made the drought five to six times more likely  (Pascale et al., 2020; see also AR6 WGI Chapter 10, Section 10.6.2). The severity of the drought presented new challenges to the existing management and governance capacity to ensure equitable and sustainable water service delivery. The city’s water supply infrastructure and demand management practice were unprepared for the ‘rare and severe’ event of three consecutive years of below average rainfall (Wolski, 2018; Muller, 2019). Despite a potential total storage volume of about 900,000 Ml of water (enough water for around a year and a half of normal usage, after taking evaporation into account), Cape Town’s reservoirs fell from 97% full in 2014 to less than 20% in May 2018 (Ouweneel et al., 2020; Cole et al., 2021). The drought saw residents queue for water as restrictions were imposed together with threats of closure of water provision to households (Sorensen, 2017; Scheba and Millington, 2018). Poor communication in the early stages of the drought (Hellberg, 2020) and a lack of trust in the administration contributed to a near-panic situation at the threat of ‘Day Zero’ as dams almost ran dry in the first half of 2018 (Enqvist and Ziervogel, 2019; Simpson et al., 2020c). ‘Day Zero’ was avoided largely through public response, water demand management and the 2018 winter rains (Sorensen, 2017; Booysen et al., 2019a; Muller, 2019; Rodina, 2019b; Matikinca et al., 2020). At a household level, responses to the drought showed everyday residents can display unprecedented degrees of resilience (Sorensen, 2017), including behavioural and attitudinal shifts and technological innovation across the full socioeconomic spectrum (Ouweneel et al., 2020). But the private nature of some of these responses extended existing inequality in water access through privileged forms of ‘gated adaptation’ by elites which conventional water governance arrangements were unprepared for (Simpson et al., 2019b; Simpson et al., 2020a).These ‘climate gating’ actions, such as drilling boreholes, secured water access for high-income households and companies, but excluded a large proportion of Cape Town’s population who could not afford such private technologies (Simpson et al., 2019a; Simpson et al., 2020b). These responses were unanticipated by the city administration and compounded fiscal challenges faced by the municipality which could no longer use revenues from high-consumption households to cross-subsidise water for low-income households (Simpson et al., 2020a). This shift threatened to undermine the sustainability of the municipal fiscus and general water access ( Box 9.8; Simpson et al., 2019a; Simpson et al., 2020a). In order to recover losses, municipal water tariffs for consumers were raised by 26% in 2018 (Muller, 2018; Simpson et al., 2019a). In addition to a decline in tourism, median estimations of the overall economic impact of the drought indicate loss of 27.6 billion South African Rand (USD 1.7 billion) translating into 64,810 job losses in the Western Cape, with Cape Town accounting for approximately half of those job losses (DEDAT, 2018). This had a disproportionate impact on unskilled and semi-skilled workers, particularly for those from low- and middle-income households (DEDAT, 2018). The drought also exacerbated the potential for sanitation health risks of the urban poor where tens of thousands of people lack access to safely managed sanitation facilities (Enqvist and Ziervogel, 2019).The Day Zero Disaster Plan included prioritising and protecting the poor and most vulnerable communities where critical infrastructure and facilities and vulnerable and informal residential areas would remain connected while higher-income residential areas would be cut off (Cole et al., 2021). Yet it is important to recognise that pre-existing deficiencies in service delivery meant water access for the urban poor did not change as significantly during the drought, particularly those in informal settlements who collect water from standpipes (Enqvist and Ziervogel, 2019; Matikinca et al., 2020). For these communities, the negative economic impact of the drought was compounded by the unintended consequences of demand management regulation emanating from the drought response. South Africa ostensibly ensures a constitutional right to water, regardless of ability to pay (Rodina, 2016), 58). Since 2018, however, as a consequence of new water tariffs instituted during the drought, Cape Town residents now have had to ‘prove their poverty’ in order to register as indigent households and access their water right (Scheba and Millington, 2018). Further, since 2007 and with increasing effect during the drought, the municipality has installed approximately 250,000 water management devices as a credit control and, during the drought, also a consumption control measure. As these have been largely installed in low-income homes, this control measure disproportionately affected poor households (Scheba and Millington, 2018; Enqvist and Ziervogel, 2019).Lessons from the droughtThe effect of communication at different stages in the drought highlights how critical information needs to be provided in a format and language that empowers people to act appropriately and collaboratively (Muller, 2019; Rodina, 2019b; Rodina, 2019a). Getting political decisions made in a timely fashion and with public support is a long-standing challenge for managers of urban water supplies (Muller, 2017; Muller, 2019). In Cape Town this was further challenged by dependence on a malfunctioning national department for water supply planning, poor coordination between the spheres of government—city, provincial and national governments—and poor collaboration between political representatives, technical experts and strategic managers (Madonsela et al., 2019; Nhamo and Agyepong, 2019; Rodina, 2019a; Ziervogel, 2019b). This highlights the need to strengthen partnerships and collaboration across sectors and scales of governance (Ziervogel, 2019a), including the adoption of a ‘whole-of-society’ approach that recognises the contributions of non-state actors as adopted in the Cape Town Resilience Strategy (CoCT, 2019; Simpson et al., 2020a). Experienced yet inflexible water management initially operated at a distance from politicians and their citizens. There was limited knowledge and capacity in how various municipal departments thought about risk, exposure and vulnerability of Cape Town’s highly differentiated population (Mukheibir and Ziervogel, 2007; Pasquini et al., 2015; Madonsela et al., 2019). In the later stages of the drought, Cape Town’s water management department was able to work collaboratively across different departments and with politicians to implement responses.The Cape Town case highlights how disaster planning for slow-onset city-wide shocks will be become increasingly important to safeguard equity and sustainability across African cities (Cole et al., 2021). It demonstrates the importance of integrating state and non-state responses to climate change in municipal adaptation and disaster planning (Booysen et al., 2019a; Booysen et al., 2019b; Simpson et al., 2020a), particularly for responses with unintended consequences. Further, water tariff models need to be flexible enough and have built-in redundancies in order to prioritise the needs of the urban poor and ensure climate responses do not disproportionately affect low-income groups and deepen existing inequalities (Scheba and Millington, 2018; Enqvist and Ziervogel, 2019; Simpson et al., 2019b). Systems and relationships of mutual accountability can also build more effective water management between spheres of government and enhance horizontal collaboration between municipal departments and non-state entities (Ziervogel, 2019b; Ziervogel, 2019a).Box 8.5
