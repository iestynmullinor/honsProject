Economic losses include income and physical assets and non-economic losses include mortality, mobility and mental well-being losses from climate change (see Section 8.3.4). The IPCC WGII AR5 (IPCC, 2014a) primarily associated L&Ds with extreme weather events and economic impacts, and treated it primarily as a future risk. New evidence provides insights into present-day L&Ds from slow-onset impacts (e.g., sea level rise) (Adamo et al., 2021) and non-economic losses (e.g., cultural impacts, emotional and psychological distress) (McNamara et al., 2021b) which previously received much less attention. AR5 had more focus on L&Ds in high-income regions than in regions most at risk, such as SIDS and least developed countries (LDCs) (van der Geest and Warner, 2020).Impacts of climate change are affecting the economic and non-economic dimensions of people’s lives, including subsistence practices of communities that are experiencing decreases in agriculture productivity and quality, water stress, increases in pests and diseases, disruption to culture, and emotional and psychological distress, to cite just a few (Savo et al., 2016). For example, the cumulative effects of slow-onset events threaten food security especially among the poor in Latin America and the Caribbean—regions which face the largest gender gap in terms of food security globally (Zuñiga et al., 2021). In general for Global South countries, the global average temperature warming (including the Paris target of 1.5°C) means substantially higher warming and including higher frequency and magnitude of extreme events, that will result in significant impacts on societal vulnerability (Aitsi-Selmi and Murray, 2016; Djalante, 2019).Measuring losses from climate change impacts in terms of poverty and inequality can be difficult, and part of the lack of assessments of non-economic L&D can be attributed to the limited observational climate data on poor countries and population impacted, which are mostly concentrated in the Southern Hemisphere (Roy et al., 2018).This is also due to the challenges posed by the limited data available for assessing attribution (Cramer et al., 2014; Harrington and Otto, 2020; Otto et al., 2020a) and lack of a comprehensive set of adaptation metrics (Otto et al., 2020b). Economic L&Ds from climate change are often assessed and reported after disasters or within crises, however, non-economic losses from climate change are often overlooked as is their relevance for poverty and livelihoods. For those who experience both economic and non-economic losses, the impacts of climate change are very real and profound (Tschakert et al., 2017; Roy et al., 2018) Particularly in low-income and most vulnerable regions, it is not the absolute economic loss, but the combination of economic and especially non-economic losses that need to receive higher attention and need to inform adaptation strategies.
