While there are limited studies that view economic and NELD from climate change at a global scale of livelihood transformations there is robust evidence on the granular linkages, at community, national and regional levels, between losses, coping strategies and livelihood shifts. Across Africa, climate change is impacting crop yields and destroying homes, resulting in loss of infrastructure and leading to non-economic losses associated with involuntary migration and displacement (Olsson et al., 2014), and loss of livestock and assets (see IPCC SR 1.5°C, Chapter 3, (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018), resulting in long-term reduction in the capacity for agriculture and land management. For example, in March 2019 Tropical Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi led to substantial losses of agriculture, infrastructure, and access to aid and support, all of which contributed to significant displacement in each country (Fischel de Andrade and de Lima Madureira, 2021). Examples of livelihood impacts include livelihood shifts among Kenyan pastoralists to camel husbandry, resulting from household inequalities in assets and changes in relation to weakening of social norms of reciprocity and social cohesion (Volpato and King, 2019).Extreme climatic events pose serious disruptions to local livelihoods and asset bases, requiring people to reconstruct, transform and diversify livelihoods (Uddin et al., 2021). Examples of livelihood shifts across Asia and Southeast Asia (e.g., Bangladesh, India, Philippines, Vietnam) include rural communities in coastal areas, urban settlements that are experiencing economic losses (high confidence) from, for example, crop failure and reduced access to fish, which contribute to non-economic losses associated with involuntary migration (Ghosh, 2018) and the malnutrition of children (Siddiqi et al., 2011). For Bangladesh, Chiba et al. (2017) show a connection between mental stress and impacts to the fundamental capacity to sustain livelihoods, such as food and a place to live, due to severe damage to houses, homesteads, properties, livestock and crops, loss of family members and relatives, and anxiousness about securing employment and income in the future. In Bangladesh coastal communities experienced losses in livelihood assets due to Cyclones Sidr and Aila (Uddin et al., 2021) and a significant number of cyclone victims were displaced from their homes by severe cyclones. People have had to change their occupations—both intra- and intersectorally—and are confronted by increased consumption and social costs. The study uncovered differences in impacts between occupations, such as farming and fishing; fishers changed their occupation post-disaster. The study also showed evidence that local people are learning to live with change and uncertainty by nurturing and combining various types of knowledge and social memory, generating diversified livelihood options and self-organising to enhance their resilience to future extreme weather events. In Bangladesh, Ahmed et al. (2019) found cyclones, riverbank erosion, salinity intrusion and floods negatively impacted people’s lives by reducing their livelihood options. Their study found that when there are limited adaptation strategies, many people turn to ‘illegal livelihoods’ included using fine mesh nets to collect shrimp fry in the rivers, as well as logging in the Sundarbans. These people include the poorest and vulnerable, and law enforcement only exacerbates their vulnerability. Escarcha et al. (2020), studied impacts of typhoons, floods and droughts on crop production and effects on livelihoods of cash crop focused on rural villages in the Philippines. Their preliminary observations show a shift from crop to livestock production as a buffer activity to recover from crop losses. Farmers changed their farming activities as a multi-adaptive response driven by past experiences of climatic changes, farmers’ social relations, household capacity and resources available.In Central Asia, the Sahel and South Asia, three global poverty hotspots, change impacts were shown to undermine traditional knowledge about livelihoods in ways that jeopardise future culture cohesion and sense of place (Tucker et al., 2015). Acosta et al. (2016) identified loss to productive sites in the Philippines with landslides destroying agriculture, leaving many farmers without livelihoods. Similarly, Beckman and Nguyen (2016) in Vietnam identified an example where communal dams had been destroyed in floods leading to lack of irrigation for communal sites and local loss of farmland for farming communities. Chandra et al. (2017) identified the vicious cycle between declining agricultural production and conditions of soil erosion due to floods and droughts resulting in decreased crop fertility to productive sites with implications for decline in crop yields, loss of crops and of livelihood assets. Climate change-related extreme weather events, such as typhoons, floods, and droughts, can have detrimental impacts on crop production (high confidence) and in the Philippines and Pakistan have significantly affected the livelihoods of cash crop-focused rural villages (Escarcha et al., 2020; Jamshed et al., 2020b). There is an emerging shift from crop to livestock production as a buffer activity to recover from crop losses (Section 5.10.4; Jamshed et al., 2017; Escarcha et al., 2020). As with many examples of livelihood shifts, the viability of the shifts in the long term under climate change have yet to be assessed.In Africa, many communities already experience drought- and flood-related disasters (high confidence) such as those that negatively impact livelihoods and assets in the Muzarabani district of Zimbabwe (Mavhura, 2017). In Muzarabani community has revived and developed new livelihood strategies to manage risks, including local informal safety nets, local farming practices and the traditional flood-proofing structures. Food security and agriculture productivity are examples of livelihood resources most at risk to climate hazards (see Figure 8.2) (high confidence). An illustration of such risks to cocoa farmers in Ghana includes increased incidences of crop pests and diseases, wilting of cocoa leaves, high mortality of cocoa seedlings which affected expansion and farm rehabilitation, and wilting of cherelles resulting in losses of crop yield. An illustration of livelihood shifts resulting from losses is of farmers shifting to cereals due to the unpredictable climatic patterns and the shortened duration of rainfall. Yet, insecurity with storage, supply chains and low returns from cereal production, coupled with land scarcity in the Western region, have resulted in a return to cocoa production (Asante et al., 2017).Research from Australia shows complex linkages between the impacts of drought on livelihood income, health and cultural heritage, increasing risk of heat stroke, and possibly a link to suicide among male farmers (Alston, 2012; Hanigan et al., 2012; Marshall et al., 2019). The link between agricultural losses and suicides has also been noted in South Asia, including India (Carleton, 2017). Livelihoods are shifting with impacts to well-being, as noted by (Evans et al., 2016), who showed connections between loss of fishery productivity and impact on tourism sector livelihoods in the Great Barrier Reef region. In Europe, losses to Indigenous Peoples are associated with loss of well-being of Sami communities and has forced livelihood shifts from reindeer herding due to loss of ecosystems to support the animals (Persson et al., 2017; Jaakkola et al., 2018). Traditional pastoralist systems are also greatly impacted by cumulative dual challenges of encroachment of other land users and by climate change. Traditional Sami reindeer herding strategies are still practiced, but the rapidly changing environmental circumstances are forcing herders into uncharted territories where traditional strategies and the transmission of knowledge between generations may be of limited use. For example, rotational grazing is no longer possible as all pastures are being used, and changes in climate result in unpredictable weather patterns unknown to earlier generations (Axelsson-Linkowski et al., 2020). These examples show that there are complex factors underpinning the linking L&D and shifting livelihoods. Moreover, there are significant challenges to undertaking a shift to secure alternative livelihoods.Linkages between losses, coping strategies and livelihood shifts in small islands (e.g., in the Pacific region, Kiribati and Tuvalu, and in the Caribbean, the Bahamas) shed light on impacted low-income households. For example, farmers have experienced extensive damage to homes and loss of infrastructure, and experience lack of migration opportunities (Curtain and Dornan, 2019). Evidence is growing that there is also significant loss of cultural heritage in resettlement (Barnett and O’neill, 2012), evidence from small islands’ displaced communities suggests that resettlement can have impacts on sense of place, identity and social fabric, a theme highly relevant to loss, coping and adapting livelihoods, and not only restricted to small islands (McNamara et al., 2021b). Roberts (2015) identified loss of communal sites in Kiribati. It is predicted that, by 2050, up to 80% of the land on the island of Buariki and 50% of the land on Bikenibeu may be completely inundated and these effects will result in significant loss of livelihoods and displacement. Throughout the Caribbean, evidence indicates that there will be an overall reduction in the area of land suitable for crop cultivation, as the region’s climate gets progressively warmer and as rainfall becomes more variable (Rhiney et al., 2016).The multiple shocks of extreme events reduce crop yields, destroy homes, and lead to loss of infrastructure and displacement (high confidence). These are experienced in South and North America. For example, in Peru, glacial outbursts have led to loss of livelihoods (Drenkhan et al., 2019). People use a range of coping and adaptation strategies to deal with hazards where they live, such as shifting livelihood activities, inputs or production areas. However, traditional techniques are increasingly failing due to changing weather patterns. Across Peru, findings demonstrate that people use temporary and permanent migration among their many coping and adaptation strategies. Hazards related to water excess have been the key force in destroying homes and driving displacement in Peru. In contrast, studies demonstrate that water scarcity also threatens livelihoods and thereby influences migration in Peru. While non-climatic reasons for moving dominate migrants’ motivations in many areas of Peru, water-related climatic drivers of migration are becoming increasingly relevant (Wrathall et al., 2014). Peru’s smallholder farmers and urban poor are not responsible for the climate crisis, yet their lives and cultural heritage are being increasingly jeopardised by its effects, making improvements in governance an imperative for Peru (Bergmann et al., 2021). Another area of significance is coffee production in Brazil, where the majority of Brazilian coffee farms are operated by smallholders, producers with relatively small properties, who are mostly reliant on family labour (Koh et al., 2020). In the USA (e.g., New Orleans and Puerto Rico), people have lost livelihoods due to displaced households and destroyed homes, leading to loss of income, as well as loss of social networks and family networks and loss of cultural heritage. For example, impacts of Hurricane Katrina have led to people being displaced from their employment, many evacuees had to relocate to new areas, which disrupted their social networks and placed them in unfamiliar labour markets, resulting in mental health challenges (Palinkas, 2020). There has also been a ‘climate gentrification’ in parts of New Orleans (Aune et al., 2020). Many of those who returned to their pre-Katrina areas had to deal with extensive damage to their homes and to public infrastructure.In summary, across regions there is an increasing number of examples of observed economic and NELD from climate change. Adaptation measures need to better incorporate actions to tackle the burgeoning negative social, psychological and well-being impacts of climate change (Barnett et al., 2016; Box 8.5). At present, losses from climate change are potentially growing faster than adaptation measures across the globe. It is still uncertain how economic and non-economic losses trigger successful or viable new climate-related livelihood transitions for the poor and people or groups in vulnerable situations in the future (see Sections 8.4.4; 8.4.5). In all likelihoods, economic losses from climate hazards (e.g., drought) will be compounded by many factors including COVID-19 and other vulnerability drivers. For instance, globally, small-scale coffee producers have been destabilised by COVID-19, but also because of a history of recurrent (climate) shocks and structural inequalities, and may have to shift into alternative livelihoods (Guido et al., 2020). Coastal communities in Vanuatu have been impacted in the immediate period after COVID-19 showing changes in village populations, loss of cash income and difficulties in accessing food, and have experienced shifting pressures on particular resources and habitats (Steenbergen et al., 2020). This trend poses real challenges to equity and sustainability.In summary, this section has moved beyond the IPCC WGII AR5 in laying out structural elements of vulnerability and climate-related vulnerability hotspots globally, such as poverty, lack of access to basic services, gender inequality and undernourishment. The assessment provides new quantitative evidence about the global spatial distribution of systemic human vulnerability and therewith underscores that various hotspots of countries classified as having very high or high vulnerability emerge in regional clusters. In addition, the number of people living in very highly and highly vulnerable country contexts is significantly higher in some assessments, with even twice as many as the number of people living in countries classified as having low and very low vulnerability. The evidence suggests that statistically relevant differences in fatalities per hazard event are not just a product of the hazard event, but also strongly linked with the level of vulnerability of the region or community exposed. The assessment of non-economic losses has also received little attention in past IPCC Assessment Reports, therefore this section has provided new insights on how (next to measurable economic losses) non-economic losses and intangible losses emerge. These non-economic losses represent an important dimension of societal impacts of climate change that has not sufficiently captured so far within standard damage or post-disaster assessments. Finally, the section provides evidence about the existing adaptation gap in terms of differential vulnerabilities and various non-economic losses already experienced.
