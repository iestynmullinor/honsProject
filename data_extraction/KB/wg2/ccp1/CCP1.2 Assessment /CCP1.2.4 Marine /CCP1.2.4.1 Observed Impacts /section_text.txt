Observed impacts attributable to climate change are strongly biased geographically, with most data from the temperate Northern Hemisphere, followed by subtropical to temperate Australia and few long-term data in the tropics (Poloczanska et al., 2013; Poloczanska et al., 2016). Marine heatwaves have increased over the past century, causing mass mortalities in the hotspots of the Mediterranean (H216), Great Barrier Reef (H236), western and southern Australia (H227, 228), northwest Atlantic (H207) and northeast Pacific (H197) (high confidence) (Hobday et al., 2018; Oliver et al., 2018). The shift of thousands of species from equatorial latitudes since the 1950s has been attributed to climate warming (medium confidence) (Chaudhary et al., 2021).Climate change-related hazards, particularly marine heat events, have caused widespread coral bleaching and mass mortalities as the time between consecutive bleaching events decreases (high confidence) (IPCC, 2018; Bindoff et al., 2019; IPCC, 2019b). Coral reefs in some Indian Ocean hotspots (H230, 234) already exhibit net loss of coral reefs (low confidence) (Perry et al., 2018). While coral bleaching is a visible symptom of heat stress, warming has also induced restructuring of associated fish and invertebrate communities in the Great Barrier Reef (H236) (medium confidence) (Stuart-Smith et al., 2018).Although the number of coral species that are both exposed and vulnerable to climate hazards is greatest in the central Indo-Pacific, the proportion of corals at risk is greater in the lower diversity Caribbean hotspots (H209) (medium confidence) (Foden et al., 2013). Some reef corals are able to acclimate to heatwaves (low confidence) (DeCarlo et al., 2019), and some have expanded their latitudinal ranges polewards (high confidence), up to 14 km yr –1 in the northwest Pacific (Yamano et al., 2011). Although future latitudinal expansions may be limited by winter light availability (Muir et al., 2015), new coral reefs are already emerging in Japan (Kumagai et al., 2018).The Mediterranean Sea hotspot (H216) is negatively affected by climate change (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Paper 4). Species entering via the Suez Canal from the Red Sea (H220) are facilitated by warming and lead to profound community changes (high confidence) (Yeruham et al., 2015; Rilov, 2016; Vasilakopoulos et al., 2017; Givan et al., 2018; Bianchi et al., 2019). In contrast, the more open coastal seas of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America have had increasing species richness since the 1970s (Batt et al., 2017).Kelp forests are in decline in mid-latitudes due to warming and associated increased herbivory (medium confidence) (Section 3.4.2.3, Chapter 11). South and southeastern (H228), and southwestern (H227) Australia have experienced a climate-related decline of kelp forests (Wernberg et al., 2011; Vergés et al., 2016; Wernberg et al., 2016). West Australia (H227) has been affected by extreme climate events characterised by the replacement of kelp and sessile invertebrates by algal turfs and warm-water fish species (Wernberg et al., 2013; Wernberg et al., 2016). Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (H236), kelp forests, seagrass meadows and mangroves (due to drought), have suffered mortalities due to climate change (medium confidence) (Babcock et al., 2019). Climate warming driven changes in seaweed assemblages have been reported not only in Australia, but in the marine biodiversity hotspots of Atlantic Canada, Japan, Mediterranean, New Zealand (Laffoley and Baxter, 2016; Thomsen et al., 2019; Thomsen and South, 2019) and California (H207, 231, 216, 238, 199) (Arafeh-Dalmau et al., 2019; McPherson et al., 2021). However, while climate change is having measurable effects on kelp, the dominant effects on kelp projected to 2025 are fishing, through its effects on herbivores and predators (medium confidence) (Steneck et al., 2002). Although fishing affected Atlantic cod in the Barents Sea (H214) and Gulf of Maine (H207) biodiversity hotspots, it was also affected by climate change, but negatively and positively, respectively (Kjesbu et al., 2014; Pershing et al., 2015).Range expansions out of the Nansei Shoto (H231) hotspot south of Japan has led to the replacement of temperate kelp forests by tropical coral and herbivorous fishes on Japanese coasts (Kumagai et al., 2018). The Yellow Sea (H230) is one of the most exploited marine hotspots, with decreasing ecosystem services compounded by climate change but there is low confidence for climate change contributing substantially to ecological degradation (Wang et al., 2016; Song and Duan, 2019).Upwelling systems are best known for bringing nutrients to the surface. These stimulate phytoplankton blooms, which in turn support important fisheries (Section 3.4.2.1 1). However, this deep water also tends to be low in oxygen, which can be further depleted by respiration and surface warming. Prolonged marine heatwaves in the Californian Current hotspot (H197) drove major shifts in the geographic range of birds, mammals, fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other species, and toxic algal blooms (Sanford et al., 2019).In both the Antarctic (H213) and Arctic (H196, 214), the loss of ice impacts on the behaviour and foraging ability of marine mammals and birds (Doney et al., 2012). The retreat of sea ice in the Bering Sea (H196) hotspot has been followed by a reorganisation of the seabed and fish communities, a northward shift in species, and greater species’ biomass and richness (Mueter and Litzow, 2008; Grebmeier et al., 2018). In the Eurasian Arctic (H214), species richness has similarly been increasing (Węsławski et al., 2011; Kortsch et al., 2012; Certain and Planque, 2015; Fossheim et al., 2015; Węsławski et al., 2018), as has phytoplankton productivity (Arrigo et al., 2008). The distribution of krill has already contracted with ocean warming in the Southern Ocean (medium confidence) (Cox et al., 2018; Atkinson et al., 2019).
