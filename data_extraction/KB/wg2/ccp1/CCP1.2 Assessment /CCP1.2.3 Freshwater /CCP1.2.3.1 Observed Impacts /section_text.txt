An analysis of trends in 190 river basins in Australia found that stream-flows have been declining, including in the Central Australian (H194) and Kimberley (H191) hotspots, due to greater terrestrial plant uptake of water in response to climate-related increases in carbon dioxide (low confidence) (Ukkola et al., 2016). We did not find any other publications providing evidence of impacts of climate change on freshwater biodiversity within the hotspots. Whether this is because freshwater temperatures tend to be cooler due to inputs from groundwater and/or mountain streams (Knouft and Ficklin, 2017), resilience of freshwater species or lack of research is unclear.
