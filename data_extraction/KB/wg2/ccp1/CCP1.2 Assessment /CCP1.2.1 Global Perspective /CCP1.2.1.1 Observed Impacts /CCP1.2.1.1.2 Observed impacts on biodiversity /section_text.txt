Although conservation status has only been assessed globally for about 6% of all species (Costello, 2019) and most confirmed extinctions and threatened species are terrestrial, a higher proportion of freshwater species are threatened. This is reflected in the higher proportion of freshwater hotspots impacted by humans (Collen et al., 2014; Costello, 2015; Harrison et al., 2018). The rate of species endemicity is exceptionally high in freshwater biogeographic realms (i.e., large regions of distinct species composition and endemicity), at 89–96% for fish in all but one realm, compared to 11–98% for terrestrial vertebrate groups (Leroy et al., 2019) and 17–84% for marine realms (Costello et al., 2017). Already, one-third of wetlands have been lost and 9000 freshwater species are threatened with extinction without considering the effects of climate change (Darwall et al., 2018), and only 13% of world rivers were recently classified as least impacted (Su et al., 2021).Globally, observed climate-driven changes in biodiversity are typically of species distributions shifting to higher latitudes (virtually certain) (Lenoir et al., 2020, Ch.2, Ch. 3.4). Since the 1950s, marine species richness has shifted poleward in the Northern Hemisphere, increased in mid-latitudes and declined at the equator in concert with ocean warming (medium confidence) (Chaudhary et al., 2021). Climate-driven altitudinal shifts are common on land (high confidence) (Lenoir and Svenning, 2015; Steinbauer et al., 2018), and depth shifts in the ocean may occur but are little studied (low confidence) (Burrows et al., 2019; Jorda et al., 2020). While climate-induced range expansions can be viewed as opportunities for increasing regional biodiversity, range contractions adversely affect biodiversity through regional extirpations (high confidence) (Cahill et al., 2013; Chaudhary et al., 2021).Both of the two climate change associated global species extinctions to date support the predictions that endemic species on mountains and islands are at the greatest risk of extinction (Manes et al., 2021). The golden toad (Bufo periglenes) became extinct after some years of decline associated with changes in climate warming and precipitation in the Talamancan-Isthmian Pacific Forests biodiversity hotspot (H22) (Pounds et al., 1999; Cahill et al., 2013, WGII Ch2.4.2.2). The Bramble Cay melomys (Melomys rubicola),  a rodent endemic to an island between Australia and Papua New Guinea and closely related to a mainland Australian species, became extinct due to habitat loss arising from climate change-related sea level rise and cyclone activity (Fulton, 2017; Roycroft et al., 2021, WGII Ch.11).
