Patterns of vulnerability and adaptive capacity are highly context dependent and vary within and among fishing communities in coastal and riparian areas (Ndhlovu and Saito, 2017; Lowe et al., 2019; D’agata et al., 2020). Interventions that integrate scientific knowledge and fishers’ local knowledge while focusing on vulnerable groups are expected to be more successful (Musinguzi et al., 2018; Muringai et al., 2019b). Infrastructure improvements (e.g., storage facilities, processing technologies, transport systems) could reduce post-harvest losses and improve food safety (Chan et al., 2019). Fisher safety can be aided by early warning of severe weather conditions (Thiery et al., 2017), enhanced through communication via mass media and mobile phones (Thiery et al., 2017; Kiwanuka-Tondo et al., 2019). Although changing fishing gears and shifting target species are important adaptation options for artisanal fishers, many have instead expanded their fishing range or increased effort (Musinguzi et al., 2015; Belhabib et al., 2016). Adapting to the impacts of climate change on marine fisheries productivity requires management reforms accounting for shifting productivity and species distributions, such as increasing marine protected areas, strengthening regional trade networks, and increasing the investment and innovation in climate-resilient aquaculture production (Golden et al., 2021). This could yield higher catch and profits in the future relative to today in 50% of African countries with marine territories under 2°C global warming and in 35% under 4.3°C global warming (Free et al., 2020). For inland fisheries, opportunities for adaptation include better integration of inland fisheries into management plans from other sectors (e.g., hydropower and irrigation) (Harrod et al., 2018c; Cowx and Ogutu-Ohwayo, 2019; McCartney et al., 2019). There is growing interest in enhancing the supply of freshwater fishery production from small water bodies and reservoirs in dryland regions of sub-Saharan Africa (Kolding et al., 2016).
