Marine and freshwater fisheries provide 19.3% of animal protein intake (Chan et al., 2019) and support the livelihoods of 12.3 million people (de Graaf and Garibaldi, 2015) across Africa. Estimates suggest that fish provides approximately 200 million people in Africa with their main source of animal protein and key micronutrients (Obiero et al., 2019). Although marine fisheries account for >50% of total capture fishery production (Obiero et al., 2019), 2.9 million tonnes of fish are harvested annually from inland water bodies constituting the highest per capita inland fishery production of any continent (2.56 kg per person per year) (Harrod et al., 2018a; Funge-Smith and Bennett, 2019).Climate change already poses a significant threat to marine and freshwater fisheries and aquaculture in Africa (Blasiak et al., 2017; Harrod et al., 2018a). Severe (>30%) coral bleaching has impacted ~80% of major reef areas in the western Indian Ocean and Red Sea along Africaâ€™s eastern coast (Hughes et al., 2018). Biological effects (e.g., changes in primary production, fish distribution) have also occurred (Hidalgo et al., 2018). Range shifts in marine fish species can exacerbate boundary conflicts among fisher communities (Penney et al., 2017; Belhabib et al., 2019). Changes in fish distribution and reductions in catch across inland fisheries are associated with climatic variability by fishing communities (Okpara et al., 2017b; Lowe et al., 2019; Muringai et al., 2019b). Floods and reduced river flow reduces fish catches (Kolding et al., 2019), which scale positively with discharge rates in rivers across Africa (McIntyre et al., 2016). Warming air and water temperatures have altered water stratification patterns in African lakes causing reductions in or redistributions of primary productivity and leading to reduced fish biomass (Section 9.6.1.3). Such changes, partially explain reduced fish catches in Lake Tanganyika (Cohen et al., 2016). In some regions, water scarcity has resulted in conflict within and among food production sectors (pastoralists, fishers and farmers) in this region (Okpara et al., 2017b). Small-scale and artisanal fisher communities are ill-equipped to adapt to climate impacts because there are few financially accessible alternative livelihoods (Belhabib et al., 2016; Ndhlovu and Saito, 2017).
