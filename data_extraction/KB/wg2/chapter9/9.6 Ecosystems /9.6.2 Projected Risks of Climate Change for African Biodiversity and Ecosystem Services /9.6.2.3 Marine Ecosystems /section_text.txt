African coastal and marine ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate change (high confidence). At 1.5°C of global warming, mangroves will be exposed to sedimentation and sea level rise, while seagrass ecosystems will be most affected by heat extremes (high confidence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) and turbidity (Wong et al., 2014). These risks will be amplified at 2°C and 3°C (virtually certain) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). Over 90% of east African coral reefs are projected to be destroyed by bleaching at 2°C of global warming (very high confidence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). At around 2.5°C global warming, an important reef-building coral (Diploastrea heliopora) in the central Red Sea is projected to stop growing altogether (Cantin et al., 2010). By 2.5°C, suitable habitat of >50% of species are projected to decline for coastal lobster in east and north Africa, with large declines for the commercially important lobster species Jasus lalandii in southern Africa (Boavida-Portugal et al., 2018). More generally, tropical regions, especially exclusive economic zones in west Africa, are projected to lose large numbers of marine species and may experience sudden declines with extratropical regions having potential net increases as species track shifting temperatures poleward (García Molinos et al., 2016; Trisos et al., 2020).
