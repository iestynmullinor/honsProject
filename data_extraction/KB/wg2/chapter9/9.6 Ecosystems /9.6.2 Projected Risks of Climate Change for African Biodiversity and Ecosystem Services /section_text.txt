Invasive species threaten African ecosystems and livelihoods (Ranasinghe et al., 2021). For instance, economic impacts were estimated at USD 1 billion per year for smallholder maize farmers in east Africa (Pratt et al., 2017). Climate change is projected to change patterns of invasive species spread (high confidence). The area of suitable climate for Lantana camara is projected to contract (Taylor et al., 2012) and to expand for Prosopis juliflora (Sintayehu et al., 2020). Bioclimatic suitability for fall armyworm, a major threat to maize, is projected to decrease in central Africa but expand in southern and west Africa (Zacarias, 2020), and to expand for coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) in Uganda and around Mount Kenya (Jaramillo et al., 2011). Climate suitability for tephritid fruit flies is projected to decrease in central Africa (Hill et al., 2016). Increased water temperature is projected to favour invasive over local freshwater fish populations and shift the range of invasive aquatic plants in South Africa (Hoveka et al., 2016; Shelton et al., 2018). Alterations to lake and river connectivity are predicted to modify invasion pathways in Lake Tanganyika and water hyacinth coverage may increase with warmer waters in Lake Victoria (Masters and Norgrove, 2010; Plisnier et al., 2018).
