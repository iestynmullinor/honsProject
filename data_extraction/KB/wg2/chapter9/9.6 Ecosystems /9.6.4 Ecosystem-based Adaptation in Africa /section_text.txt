Marine and coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrass and coral reefs provide storm protection and food security for coastal communities (high confidence) (IPCC, 2019d). Restoring reef systems reduced wave height in Madagascar (Narayan et al., 2016), but there is limited evidence for the efficacy of coral reef restoration at large scales with increased warming (Chapter 3 Section 3.6.3). Populations at risk from storm surge and/or sea level rise coincide with areas of high coastal EbA potential from Mozambique to Somalia, and coastlines of the Gulf of Guinea, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone (Jones et al., 2020). Understanding hotspots of EbA potential is particularly important for west Africa with some of the highest levels of human dependence on marine ecosystems at high risk from climate change and large populations vulnerable to sea level rise (Sections 9.9.3.1; 9.8.5.2; Selig et al., 2018; Trisos et al., 2020).Marine protected areas (MPAs) can yield multiple adaptation benefits, such as buffering species from extinction and increasing fish stocks, as well as storing large amounts of carbon (Edgar et al., 2014; Roberts et al., 2017; Lovelock and Duarte, 2019). However, this potential of MPAs will reach limits with increased warming (Roberts et al., 2017). For example, MPAs cannot prevent coral bleaching at scale and mass die-offs are well-described from MPAs following climate shocks (Bates et al., 2019; Bruno et al., 2019). However, prioritising MPA coverage of climate refugia, such as the Northern Mozambique Channel, may offer some increased resilience (McClanahan et al., 2014).
