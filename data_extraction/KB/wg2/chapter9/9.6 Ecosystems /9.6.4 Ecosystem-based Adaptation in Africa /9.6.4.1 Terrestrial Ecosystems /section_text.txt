Improved ecosystem care and restoration are cost-effective for carbon sequestration while providing multiple environmental, social and economic co-benefits (Griscom et al., 2017; Shukla et al., 2019). Protecting and restoring natural forests and wetlands reduces flood risk across multiple African countries (Bradshaw et al., 2007). In Kenya, enclosures for rangeland regeneration diversified income sources, which could increase the adaptive capacity of local people (Mureithi et al., 2016; Wairore et al., 2016). Sustainable agroforestry in semi-arid regions provides income sources from fuelwood, fruit and timber and reduces exposure to drought, floods and erosion (Quandt et al., 2017). Forest protection in Zimbabwe maintains honey production during droughts, providing food supply options if crops fail (Lunga and Musarurwa, 2016). Community-based natural resource management in pastoral communities improved institutional governance outcomes through involving community members in decision making, increasing the capacity of these communities to respond to climate change (Reid, 2014).EbA can also increase ecological resilience. Re-introduction of fire and large mammals can restore ecosystem services, enhance adaptive capacity and benefit people by combatting woody encroachment, restoring grazing and increasing streamflow (Asner et al., 2016; Stafford et al., 2017; Cromsigt et al., 2018). Herbivores can also reduce fuel loads in areas facing increased fire risk (Hempson et al., 2017).Protected areas can be ‘stepping stones’ that facilitate climate-induced species range shifts (Roberts et al., 2020), preserve medicinal plant diversity despite climate change (Kaky and Gilbert, 2017) and provide livelihood diversification opportunities (Table 9.6). Protecting 30% of sub-Saharan Africa’s land area could reduce the proportion of species at risk of extinction by around 60% in both low and high warming scenarios (Hannah et al., 2020). The role of protected areas in EbA can be strengthened by: (a) increasing coverage of diverse environments and high carbon storage ecosystems, (b) restoring habitat, (c) maintaining intact habitat, (d) participatory, equitable conservation and adaptation strategies; (e) cooperating across borders and (f) adequate monitoring (Gillson et al., 2013; Rannow et al., 2014; Midgley and Bond, 2015; Pecl et al., 2017; Dinerstein et al., 2019; Roberts et al., 2020).
