Small climatic variations have large impacts on ecosystem function in Africa’s freshwaters (Ndebele-Murisa, 2014; Ogutu-Ohwayo et al., 2016). Warming of water temperatures from 0.2°C to 3.2°C occurred in several lakes over 1927–2014 and has been attributed to human-caused climate change (Figure 9.17; Ogutu-Ohwayo et al., 2016). Increased temperature, changes in rainfall and reduced wind speed altered the physical and chemical properties of inland water bodies, affecting water quality and productivity of algae, invertebrates and fish (high confidence). In deeper lakes, warmer surface waters and decreasing wind speeds reduced shallow waters mixing with nutrient-rich deeper waters, reducing biological productivity in the upper sunlit zone (Ndebele-Murisa, 2014; Saulnier-Talbot et al., 2014). In several lakes, climate change was identified as causing changes in insect emergence time (Dallas and Rivers-Moore, 2014) and in loss of fish habitats (Natugonza et al., 2015; Gownaris et al., 2016). This set of changes can harm human livelihoods, for example, from reduced fisheries productivity (see Section 9.8.5; Ndebele-Murisa, 2014; Ogutu-Ohwayo et al., 2016) and reduced water supply and quality (Section 9.7.1).
