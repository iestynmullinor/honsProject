Assessment of impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation highlights climate change is leading to loss and damage across Africa, that breach current and projected adaptation limits (Table 9.1; Cross-Chapter Box LOSS in Chapter 17).Table 9.1 | Loss and damage from climate change across sectors covered in this report. Loss and damage arise from adverse climate-related impacts and risks from both sudden-onset events, such as floods and cyclones, and slower-onset processes, including droughts, sea level rise, glacial retreat and desertification and include both include both economic (e.g., loss of assets and crops) and non-economic types (e.g., loss of biodiversity, heritage and health) (UNFCCC Paris Agreement, 2015; IPCC, 2018a; Mechler et al., 2020). Sections marked with * and in bold highlight Loss and Damage attributed to human-induced climate change (16.1.3).SectorLoss and damage from climate changeObservedProjectedEcosystemsLocal, regional and global extinctionReduced ecosystem goods and servicesDeclining natural coastal protection and habitatsAltered ecosystem structure and declining ecosystem functioningNature-based tourismBiodiversity loss9.6.29.6.1; 9.6.29.6.1; 9.6.29.6.19.6.39.6.2*9.6.29.6.29.6.29.6.29.6.3WaterDeclining lake and river resourcesReduced hydroelectricity and irrigationDisappearing glaciersReduced groundwater recharge and salinisationDrought9.7.19.7.2; 9.9.19.5.9*; 9.7.1–Box 9.4*9.7.29.7.2; 9.9.3; Box 9.59.5.99.7.2Food systemsReduced crop productivity and revenuesIncreased livestock mortality and price shocksDecreased fodder and pasture availabilityReduced fisheries catch and fisher livelihoods9.7.2*, 9.8.1; 9.8.2; 9.11.1; Box 9.59.8.29.8.29.6.1; 9.8.59.8.2; 9.8.3; Box 9.59.8.29.8.29.8.5Human settlements and infrastructureLoss or damage to formal and informal dwellingsDamage to transport systemsDamage to energy systemsWater supply, sanitation, education and health infrastructureMigration9.9.29.9.29.9.29.9.2; 9.10; 9.11.19.9.1; Box 9.89.9.49.9.49.7.2; 9.9.49.7.3; 9.9.4; 9.10; 9.11.19.9.4; Box 9.8HealthLoss of lifeLoss of productivityReduced nutrition9.9.2*; 9.10.2; Box 9.99.10.3; 9.11.19.8.1; 9.10.29.9.4; 9.10.29.10.2; 9.11.29.10.2Economy, poverty and livelihoodsLoss of livelihoods, jobs and incomeReduced productive landReduced economic growth and increased inequalityCommunity and involuntary displacementReduced labour productivity and earning potentialDelayed and poorer education progressReduced tourismIncreased urban in-migration9.9.2; 9.10.2; 9.11.19.8.29.11.1*; Box 9.59.9.3; Box 9.89.11.19.11.19.6.39.8.1; 9.9.1; Table Box 9.89.10.2; 9.11.29.8.29.11.29.9.4; Box 9.89.11.29.11.19.5.9, 9.6.3, 9.12.29.9.4; Table Box 9.8HeritageLoss of traditional cultures and ways of lifeLoss of language and knowledge systemsDamage to heritage sitesBox 9.2; 9.12.1–9.12.19.12.29.12.19.12.2
