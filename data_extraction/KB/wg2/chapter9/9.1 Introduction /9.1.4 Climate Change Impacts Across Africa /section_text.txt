In many parts of southern, east and west Africa, temperature or precipitation trends since the 1950s are attributable to human-caused climate change and several studies document the impacts of these climate trends on human and natural systems (high confidence) (Figure 9.5; Sections 9.5.6; 9.5.7). Nevertheless, research into attribution of trends to human-caused climate change or climate impacts remains scarce for multiple regions, especially in north and central Africa. This illustrates an ‘attribution gap’ where robust evidence for attributable impacts is twice as prevalent in high- compared to low-income countries globally (Callaghan et al., 2021). Most studies on climate impacts in Africa have focused on terrestrial ecosystems or water, with fewer on marine ecosystems, agriculture, migration, and health and well-being (Callaghan et al., 2021). Specific factors driving these knowledge gaps include limited data collection, data access and research funding for African researchers (see next section).
