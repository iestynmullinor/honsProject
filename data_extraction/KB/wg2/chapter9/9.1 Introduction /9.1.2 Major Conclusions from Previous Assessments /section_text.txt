Based on an analysis of 1022 mentions of Africa or African countries across the three AR6 Special Reports, the following main conclusions emerged.Hot days, hot nights and heatwaves have become more frequent; heatwaves have also become longer (high confidence). Drying is projected particularly for west and southwestern Africa (high confidence) (IPCC, 2018c; Shukla et al., 2019).Climate change is contributing to land degradation, loss of biodiversity, bush encroachment and spread of pests and invasive species (IPCC, 2018b; IPCC, 2019a; IPCC, 2019b).Climate change has already reduced food security through losses in crop yields, rangelands, livestock and fisheries, deterioration in food nutritional quality, access and distribution, and price spikes. Risks to crop yields are substantially less at 1.5°C compared with 2°C of global warming, with a large reduction in maize cropping areas projected even for 1.5°C, as well as reduced fisheries catch potential (IPCC, 2018b; IPCC, 2019b; IPCC, 2019a).Increased deaths from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, heat stress and diseases related to exposure to dust, fire smoke and other air pollutants are projected from further warming (IPCC, 2018c; Shukla et al., 2019).The largest reductions in economic growth for an increase from 1.5°C to 2°C of global warming are projected for low- and middle-income countries, including in Africa (IPCC, 2018c).Climate change interacts with multi-dimensional poverty, among other vulnerabilities. Africa is projected to bear an increasing proportion of the global exposed and vulnerable population at 2°C and 3°C of global warming (IPCC, 2018c).Poverty and limited financing continue to undermine adaptive capacity, particularly in rapidly growing African cities (Shukla et al., 2019).Large-scale afforestation and bioenergy can reduce food availability and ecosystem health (IPCC, 2018c; IPCC, 2019a).Transitioning to renewable energy would reduce reliance on wood fuel and charcoal, especially in urban areas, with co-benefits including reduced deforestation, desertification, fire risk and improved indoor air quality, local development and agricultural yield (Shukla et al., 2019).Sustainable use of biodiversity, conservation agriculture, reduced deforestation, land and watershed restoration, rainwater harvesting and well-planned reforestation can have multiple benefits for adaptation and mitigation, including water security, food security, biodiversity, soil conservation and local surface cooling (IPBES, 2018; Shukla et al., 2019).Climate resilience can be enhanced through improvements to early warning systems, insurance, investment in safety nets, secure land tenure, transport infrastructure, communication, access to information and investments in education and strengthened local governance (Shukla et al., 2019).Scenarios of socio-environmental change are under-used in decision making in Africa (IPBES, 2018).Africa’s rich biodiversity together with a wealth of Indigenous Knowledge and Local Knowledge (IKLK) is a key strategic asset for sustainable development (IPBES, 2018).
