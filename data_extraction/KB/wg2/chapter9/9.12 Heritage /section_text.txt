Research highlights potential in integrating Indigenous Knowledge, land use practices, scientific knowledge and heritage values to co-produce tools that refine our understanding of climate change and variability and develop comprehensive heritage adaptation policy (Table 9.13; Ekblom et al., 2019).Table 9.13 | Examples of responses to climate change impacts to heritage sites.HeritageTypeExampleType of climate impact Intervention focus or activityMain intervention activityState of materialsFinal state of heritageLiteratureTangibleAncientHistoric buildingsOunga Byzantine Fort and associated archaeological remains, TunisiaCoastal erosionArchaeological conservation of fortBuilding repairs to outer walls of fort but other archaeological areas no interventionMixed.

(2012)Conservation of heritage may require offsetting the impact of loss through partial or total excavation under certain circumstances, like environment instability, or where in situ heritage preservation is exorbitant in cost (Maarleveld and Guérin, 2013).Although many underwater shipwrecks and ruins of cities are currently preserved better in situ than similar sites on land (Feary et al., 2016), preserving such heritage is often financially prohibitive with many physical and technical challenges. Further, skill capacities of heritage agencies are limited to a few qualified archaeologists in Africa (Maarleveld and Guérin, 2013).For centuries, Africans have drawn on intangible heritage to enhance their resilience to climatic variability and support adaptation practices. For example, pastoralist communities have historically translated their experiences into memories that can be ‘translated’ into diverse adaptive practices (Oba, 2014). In coastal Kenya, Mijikenda communities rely on Indigenous Knowledge and practices used in the management of the sacred Kaya Forests to adapt their farming to a changing climate (Wekesa et al., 2015).Hence, preservation measures for transforming oral information into written records should ensure viability of intangible cultural heritage by giving due consideration to the confidentiality of culturally sensitive information and intellectual property rights (Feary et al., 2016).Inclusion of cultural landscapes and intangible heritage in the landscape approach at the regional scale development planning processes may have significant impacts on protected area management (Feary et al., 2016). For example, at the Domboshava rock art site in Zimbabwe, all management decisions are taken in direct consultation with traditional leaders and other stakeholders from surrounding communities (Chirikure et al., 2010). Such adaptation strategies promote a more open-minded approach to heritage by leveraging local development (UNESCO, 2018b).Lack of expertise and resources, together with legislation that privileges certain typologies of heritage, seem to limit implementation of approved policies (Ndoro, 2015). Additionally, cultural heritage has least priority in terms of budgetary allocation, capacity building and inclusion into school curricula. Failure to consider the views of people who attach spiritual significance to places is detrimental to the conservation of heritage places (Bwasiri, 2011). In particular, documented cases of local people having to pay an entrance fee, like tourists, to access burial grounds and places of pilgrimage negate local participation in cultural site management (Ndoro, 2015).In the long term, heritage managers and local authorities could shift from planning primarily for disaster response and recovery to strategies that focus on disaster preparedness, reducing the vulnerability of sites and strengthening resilience of local communities (UNFCCC, 2007; Domke and Pretzsch, 2016). This could evolve into innovative approaches that integrate community, government and the research sector in productive cultural heritage management partnerships.There is a need for institutions to establish, maintain and update a comprehensive inventory of underwater cultural heritage. This can be done using non-intrusive, detailed mapping of the wreck site and a three-dimensional model from which scientists can reconstruct the site in detail (Maarleveld and Guérin, 2013).
