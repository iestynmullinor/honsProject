Historically, Africa has had a unique and sustainable architecture (Diop, 2018) characterised by area-specific, traditional earthen materials and associated Indigenous technology. Key examples include Tiébélé in Burkina Faso, Walata in Mauritania, Akan in Ghana, Ghadames in Libya, Old Towns of Djenné in Mali (World Heritage Site) and other diverse earthen architecture across sub-Saharan Africa. Adegun and Adedeji (2017) indicate that earthen materials provide advantages in thermal conductivity, resistivity and diffusivity, indoor and outdoor temperature, as well as cooling and heating capacities. Moreover, earthen materials are recyclable and environmentally ‘cleaner’ (Sanya, 2012) because of the absence or small quantity of cement in production, thus reducing carbon emissions. Despite these advantages, the expertise and socio-cultural ceremonies that accompany building and renewal of earthen architecture are disappearing fast (Adegun and Adedeji, 2017). Further, earthen construction is being threatened by extreme climatic variability and changing climate that exacerbates decay (Brimblecombe et al., 2011; Bosman and Van der Westhuizen, 2014; Brooks et al., 2020).
