There is limited evidence of an increased frequency of Category 5 tropical cyclones in the southwestern Indian Ocean (Fitchett et al., 2016; Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021) and more frequent landfall of tropical cyclones over central to northern Mozambique (Malherbe et al., 2013; Muthige et al., 2018). There is a projected decrease in the number of tropical cyclones making landfall in the region at 1°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming, however, they are projected to become more intense with higher wind speeds so when they do make landfall the impacts are expected to be high (medium confidence) (Malherbe et al., 2013; Muthige et al., 2018; Ranasinghe et al., 2021).
