Total glacial area on Mount Kenya decreased by 121 × 103 m 2 (44%) during 2004–2016 (Prinz et al., 2016), Kilimanjaro from 4.8 km 2 in 1984 to 1.7 km 2 in 2011 (Cullen et al., 2013) and in the Rwenzori Mountains from ~2 km 2 in 1987 to ~1 km 2 in 2003 (Taylor et al., 2006). Declining glacial areas in east Africa are linked to rising air temperatures (Taylor et al., 2006; Hastenrath, 2010; Veettil and Kamp, 2019), and in the case of Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya, declining precipitation and atmospheric moisture (Mölg et al., 2009a; 2009b; Prinz et al., 2016; Veettil and Kamp, 2019).Glacial ice cover is projected to disappear before 2030 on the Rwenzori Mountains (Taylor et al., 2006) and Mount Kenya (Prinz et al., 2018) and by 2040 on Kilimanjaro (Cullen et al., 2013). The loss of glaciers is expected to result in a loss in tourism revenues, especially in mountain tourism (Wang and Zhou, 2019).
