Mean annual temperature across central Africa has increased by 0.75°C–1.2°C since 1960 (Aloysius et al., 2016; Gutiérrez et al., 2021). The number of hot days, heatwaves and heatwave days increased between 1979–2016 (Hu et al., 2019) and cold extremes have decreased (Figure 9.14; Aguilar et al., 2009; Seneviratne et al., 2021). Uncertainties associated with the poor ground-based observation networks in the region and associated observational uncertainties (Section 9.5.1.1) result in an assessment of medium confidence in an increase in the number of heat extremes over the region.
