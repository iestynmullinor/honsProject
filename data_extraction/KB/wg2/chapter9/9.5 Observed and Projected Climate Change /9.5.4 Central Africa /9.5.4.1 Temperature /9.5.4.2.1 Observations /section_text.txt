The severe lack of station data over the region leads to large uncertainty in the estimation of observed rainfall trends and low confidence in changes in extreme rainfall (Figure 9.13b; Creese and Washington, 2018; Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). There is some evidence of drying since the mid-20th century through decreased mean rainfall and increased precipitation deficits (Gutiérrez et al., 2021), as well as increases in meteorological, agricultural and ecological drought (medium confidence) (Seneviratne et al., 2021). However, there is spatial heterogeneity in annual rainfall trends between 1983–2010 ranging from −10 to +39 mm per year (Maidment et al., 2015), with a decline in mean seasonal April–June precipitation of −69 mm per year in most regions except in the northwest (Zhou et al., 2014; Hua et al., 2016; Klotter et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2019). Southern and eastern central Africa were identified as drought hotspots between 1991–2010 (Spinoni et al., 2014).
