Marine heatwaves are periods of extreme warm sea surface temperature that persist for days to months and can extend up to thousands of kilometres (Hobday et al., 2016; Scannell et al., 2016), negatively impacting marine ecosystems (Section 9.6.1.4).The number of marine heatwaves doubled in mediterranean north Africa and along the Somalian and southern African coastlines from 1982–2016 (Frölicher et al., 2018; Oliver et al., 2018; Laufkötter et al., 2020), very likely  as a result of human-caused climate change (Seneviratne et al., 2021). Marine heatwave intensity has increased along the southern African coastline (Oliver et al., 2018). In the ecologically sensitive region west of southern Madagascar, the longest and most intense marine heatwave in the past 35 years was recorded during the austral summer of 2017 in the region, it lasted 48 days and reached a maximum intensity of 3.44°C above the 35-year average (Mawren et al., 2021). Satellite-derived measurements of coastal marine heatwaves may under-report their intensity as measured against coastal in situ measurements (Schlegel et al., 2017).Sea surface temperatures around Africa are projected to increase by 0.5°C–1.3°C for 1.5°C global warming and increase by 1.3°C–2.0°C for 3°C global warming (Figure 9.16 f). Globally, 87% of observed marine heatwaves have been attributed to human-caused global warming, and at 2°C of global warming, nearly all marine heatwaves would be attributable to heating of the climate caused by human activities (Frölicher et al., 2018; Laufkötter et al., 2020). Increases in frequency, intensity, spatial extent and duration of marine heatwaves are projected for all coastal zones of Africa. At 1°C and 3.5°C of global warming, the probability of marine heatwave days is between 4–15 times and 30–60 times higher compared to the pre-industrial (1861–1880) 99th percentile probability, with highest increases over equatorial and sub-tropical coastal regions (Figure 9.16; Frölicher et al., 2018). These events are expected to overwhelm the ability of marine organisms and ecosystems to adapt to these changes (Section 9.6.1; Frölicher et al., 2018). Reducing emissions and limiting warming to lower levels reduces risk to these systems (high confidence) (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018).
