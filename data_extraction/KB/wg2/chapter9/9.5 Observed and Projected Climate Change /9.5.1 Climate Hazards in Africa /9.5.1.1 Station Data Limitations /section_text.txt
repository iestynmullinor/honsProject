Sustained station observation networks (Figure 9.15) are essential for the long-term analysis of local and regional climate trends, including for temperature and rainfall, as well as: the calibration of satellite-derived climate products; development of gridded climate datasets using interpolated and blended station–satellite products that form the baseline from which climate change departures are measured; development and running of early warning systems; climate projection and impact studies; and extreme event attribution studies (Harrison et al., 2019; Otto et al., 2020).However, production of salient climate information in Africa is hindered by limited availability of and access to weather and climate data, especially in central and north Africa (Figure 9.15; Coulibaly et al., 2017; Hansen et al., 2019a). Existing weather infrastructure remains suboptimal for development of reliable early warning systems (Africa Adaptation Initiative, 2018; Krell et al., 2021). For example, it is estimated only 10% of the world’s ground-based observation networks are in Africa, and that 54% of Africa’s surface weather stations cannot capture data accurately (Africa Adaptation Initiative, 2018; World Bank, 2020d). Some programmes are trying to address this issue, including the trans-African hydro-meteorological observatory (van de Giesen et al., 2014), the West African Science Service Centre on Climate Change and Adaptive Land Management (WASCAL) (Salack et al., 2019), the Southern African Science Service Centre for Climate Change, Adaptive Land Management (SASSCAL) (Kaspar et al., 2015) and the AMMA-CATCH National Observation Service and Critical Zone Exploration Network (Galle et al., 2018). However, the sustainability of observation networks beyond the life of these programmes is uncertain as many African National Meteorological and Hydrology Services experience structural, financial and technical barriers to maintaining these systems (Section 9.4.5).
