Observed mean annual and seasonal temperatures have increased 1–3°C since the mid-1970s with the highest increases in the Sahara and Sahel (Figures 9.13a; Cook and Vizy, 2015; Lelieveld et al., 2016; Dosio, 2017; Nikiema et al., 2017; Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021) and positive trends in mean annual maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) of 0.16°C and 0.28°C per decade, respectively (Mouhamed et al., 2013; Moron et al., 2016; Russo et al., 2016; Barry et al., 2018). The frequency of very hot days (TX > 35°C) and tropical nights has increased by 1–9 days and 4–13 nights per decade between 1961–2014 (Moron et al 2016), and cold nights have become less frequent (Fontaine et al., 2013; Mouhamed et al., 2013; Barry et al., 2018). In the 21st century, heatwaves have become hotter, longer and more extended compared to the last two decades of the 20th century (Mouhamed et al., 2013; Moron et al., 2016; Russo et al., 2016; Barbier et al., 2018).
