West African rainfall projections show a gradient of precipitation decrease in the west and increase in the east (medium confidence) (Figure 9.14; Dosio et al., 2021; Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). This pattern is evident at 1.5°C of global warming and the magnitude of change increases at higher warming levels (Figure 9.16c; Schleussner et al., 2016b; Kumi and Abiodun, 2018; Sylla et al., 2018). A reduction in length of the rainy season is projected over the western Sahel through delayed rainfall onset by 4–6 days at global warming levels of 1.5°C and 2°C (Kumi and Abiodun, 2018; Douville et al., 2021; Gutiérrez et al., 2021). Although there are uncertainties in rainfall projections over the Sahel (Klutse et al., 2018; Gutiérrez et al., 2021), CMIP6 models project monsoon rainfall amounts to increase by approximately 2.9% per degree of warming (Jin et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a), therefore, at higher levels of warming and towards the end of the century, a wetter monsoon is projected in the eastern Sahel (medium confidence).The frequency and intensity of extremely heavy precipitation are projected to increase under mid- and high-emission scenarios (Figures 9.13a; 9.14; Sylla et al., 2015b; Diallo et al., 2016; Akinsanola and Zhou, 2019; Giorgi et al., 2019; Dosio et al., 2021; Li et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021). However, heavy rainfall statistics from global and regional climate models may be conservative as very-high-resolution, convection-permitting climate models simulate more intense rainfall than these models (Stratton et al., 2018; Berthou et al., 2019; Han et al., 2019; Kendon et al., 2019).At 2°C global warming, west Africa is projected to experience a drier, more drought-prone and arid climate, especially in the last decades of the 21st century (Sylla et al., 2016; Zhao and Dai, 2016; Klutse et al., 2018). The duration of meteorological drought in the western parts of West Africa is projected to increase from approximately 2 months during 1950–2014 to approximately 4 months in the period 2050–2100 under RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5 (Ukkola et al., 2020). Increased intensity of heavy precipitation events combined with increasing drought occurrences will substantially increase the cumulative hydroclimatic stress on populations in west Africa during the late 21st century (Giorgi et al., 2019).
