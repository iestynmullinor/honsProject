Mean annual temperatures over the region increased by between 1.04°C and 1.44°C over the period 1961–2015 depending on the observational dataset (Gutiérrez et al., 2021) and, in northern Botswana and Zimbabwe, they have increased by 1.6°C–1.8°C between 1961–2010 (Engelbrecht et al 2015). The annual number of hot days have increased in southern Africa over the last four decades (Ceccherini et al., 2017; Kruger and Nxumalo, 2017a; 2017b) and there is increasing evidence of increased heat stress impacting agriculture and human health (Section 9.10.2). The occurrence of cold extremes, including frost days, have decreased (Figure 9.14; Kruger and Nxumalo, 2017b).
