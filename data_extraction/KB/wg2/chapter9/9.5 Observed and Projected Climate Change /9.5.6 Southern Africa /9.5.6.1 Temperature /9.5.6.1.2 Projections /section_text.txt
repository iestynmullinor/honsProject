At 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, mean annual temperatures in southern Africa are projected to be on average, 1.2°C, 2.3°C and 3.3°C warmer than the 1994–2005 average respectively (Figure 9.16a). The annual number of heatwaves is projected to increase by between 2–4 (GWL 1.5°C), 4–8 (GWL 2°C) and 8–12 (GWL 3°C) and hot and very hot days are virtually certain to increase under 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming (Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Russo et al., 2016; Dosio, 2017; Weber et al., 2018; Seneviratne et al., 2021). Cold days and cold extremes are projected to decrease under all emission scenarios with the strongest decreases associated with low mitigation (Iyakaremye et al., 2021). Children born in 2020, under a 1.5°C-compatible scenario will be exposed to 3–4 times more heatwaves in their lifetimes compared to people born in 1960, although in Angola this is 7–8 times; at GWL 2.4°C this exposure increases to 5–9 times more heatwaves (>10 times in Angola) (Thiery et al., 2021).
