Mean annual rainfall in the summer rainfall region is projected to decrease by 10–20%, accompanied by an increase in the number of consecutive dry days during the rainy season under RCP8.5 (Kusangaya et al., 2014; Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Lazenby et al., 2018; Maúre et al., 2018; Spinoni et al., 2019). The western parts of the region are projected to become drier, with increasing drought frequency, intensity and duration likely  under RCP8.5 (high confidence) (Figures 9.16c, e; 9.14; Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2018b; 2018c; Ukkola et al., 2020), including multi-year droughts (Zhao and Dai, 2016; Dosio, 2017).Dryness in the summer rainfall region is expected to increase at 1.5°C and higher levels of global warming (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018) and together with higher temperatures will enhance evaporation from the region’s mega-dams and reduce soil-moisture content (Section 9.7.1; Engelbrecht et al., 2015). Increases in drought frequency and duration are projected over large parts of southern Africa at GWL 1.5°C (Liu et al., 2018b; 2018c; Seneviratne et al., 2021) and unprecedented extreme droughts (compared to the 1981–2010 period) emerge at GWL 2°C (Spinoni et al., 2021). Meteorological drought duration is projected to increase from approximately 2 months during 1950–2014 to approximately 4 months in the mid-to-late-21st century future under RCP8.5 (Ukkola et al., 2020). Heavy precipitation in the southwestern region is projected to decrease (Donat et al., 2019) and increase in the eastern parts of southern Africa at all warming levels (Li et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021).
