At 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, mean annual temperatures in east Africa are projected to be on average, 0.6°C, 1.1°C and 2.1°C warmer than the 1994–2005 average, respectively (Figure 9.16a). Highest increases are projected over the northern and central parts of the region and the lowest increase over the coastal regions (Otieno and Anyah, 2013; Dosio, 2017). The magnitude and frequency of hot days are projected to increase from GWL 2°C and above with larger increases at higher GWLs (Figure 9.16a, b; Dosio, 2017; Bathiany et al., 2018; Dosio et al., 2018; Kharin et al., 2018). At GWL 4.6°C a number of east African cities are projected to have an up to 2000-fold increase in exposure to dangerous heat (days > 40.6 °C) compared to 1985–2005 including Blantyre-Limbe, Lusaka and Kampala (Mora et al., 2017; Rohat et al., 2019). Children born in 2020, under a 1.5°C-compatible scenario will be exposed to 3–5 times more heatwaves in their lifetimes compared to people born in 1960; this exposure increases to 4–9 times more heatwaves at GWL 2.4°C (Thiery et al., 2021). The number of potentially lethal heat days per year is projected to increase from <50 during 1995–2005 to <50 at GWL 1.6°C, 50–120 at GWL 2.5°C and 150–350 at GWL 4.4°C with largest increases at the coast (Mora et al., 2017), highlighting the new emergence of dangerous heat conditions in these areas.
