Higher mean annual rainfall, particularly in the eastern parts of east Africa are projected at GWL 1.5°C and 2°C by 25 CORDEX models (Nikulin et al., 2018; Osima et al., 2018). The additional 0.5°C of warming from 1.5°C increases average dry spell duration by between two and four days, except over southern Somalia where this is reduced by between 2–3 days (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Nikulin et al., 2018; Osima et al., 2018; Weber et al., 2018).During the short rainy season, a longer rainfall season (Gudoshava et al., 2020) and increased rainfall of over 100 mm on average is projected over the eastern Horn of Africa and regions of high/complex topography at GWL 4.5°C (Dunning et al., 2018; Endris et al., 2019; Ogega et al., 2020).During the long rainy season, there is low confidence in projected mean rainfall change (Gutiérrez et al., 2021). Although some studies report projected increased end of century rainfall (Otieno and Anyah, 2013; Kent et al., 2015), the mechanisms responsible for this are not well-understood and a recent regional model study has detected no significant change (Cook et al., 2020b). Projected wetting is opposite to the observed drying trends, giving rise to the ‘east African rainfall paradox’ (Rowell et al., 2015; Wainwright et al., 2019). In other parts of east Africa, no significant trend is evident (Ogega et al., 2020), agreement on the sign of change is low, and in some regions, CMIP5 and CORDEX data show opposite signs of change (Lyon et al., 2017; Lyon and Vigaud, 2017; Osima et al., 2018; Kendon et al., 2019; Ogega et al., 2020).Heavy rainfall events are projected to increase over the region at global warming of 2°C and higher (high confidence) (Nikulin et al., 2018; Finney et al., 2020; Ogega et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021). Drought frequency, duration and intensity are projected to increase in Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and Tanzania but decrease or not change over Kenya, Uganda and the Ethiopian Highlands (Liu et al., 2018c; Nguvava et al., 2019; Haile et al., 2020; Spinoni et al., 2020).
