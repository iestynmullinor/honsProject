Over equatorial east Africa the  short rains (October–November–December) have shown a long-term wetting trend from the 1960s until present (Manatsa and Behera, 2013; Nicholson, 2015; 2017), which is linked with western Indian Ocean warming and a steady intensification of Indian Ocean Walker Cell (Liebmann et al., 2014; Nicholson, 2015).In contrast, the long rainfall season (March–April–May) has experienced a long-term drying trend between 1986 and 2007, with rainfall declines in each of these months and a shortening of the wet season (Rowell et al., 2015; Wainwright et al., 2019). Unlike previous decades, since around 2000, the long rains have exhibited a significant relationship with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (Park et al., 2020), as multiple droughts have occurred during recent La Niña events and when the western to central Pacific sea surface temperature gradient was La Niña-like (Funk et al., 2015; Funk et al., 2018a). Wetter-than-average rainfall years within this long-term drying trend are often associated with a stronger amplitude of the Madden–Julian Oscillation (Vellinga and Milton, 2018).In the northern, summer rainfall region (June–September), a decline in rainfall occurred in the 1960s and rainfall has remained relatively low, while interannual variability has increased since the late 1980s (Nicholson, 2017); the cause of this drying trend is uncertain.Since 2005, drought frequency has doubled from once every 6 to once every 3 years and has become more severe during the long and summer rainfall seasons than during the short rainfall season (Ayana et al., 2016; Gebremeskel Haile et al., 2019). Several prolonged droughts have occurred predominantly within the arid and semi-arid parts of the region over the past three decades (Nicholson, 2017).
