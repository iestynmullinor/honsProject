Mean annual precipitation is projected to decrease in north Africa at warming levels of 2°C and higher (high confidence) with the most pronounced decreases in the northwestern parts (Figures 9.13a and; 9.14; Schilling et al., 2012; Filahi et al., 2017; Barcikowska et al., 2018; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). Meteorological drought over Mediterranean north Africa in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models are projected to increase in duration from approximately 2 months during 1950–2014 to approximately 4 months in the period 2050–2100 under RCP8.5 and SSP5-85 (Ukkola et al., 2020). Extreme rainfall (monthly maximum 1-day rainfall – RX1 day) in the region is projected to decrease (Donat et al., 2019).During 1984–2012, north Africa experienced a decreasing dust trend with north African dust explaining more than 60% of global dust variations (Shao et al., 2013). Dust loadings and related air pollution hazards (from fine particles that affect health) are projected to decrease in many regions of the Sahara as a result of decreased wind speeds (Evan et al., 2016; Ranasinghe et al., 2021).
