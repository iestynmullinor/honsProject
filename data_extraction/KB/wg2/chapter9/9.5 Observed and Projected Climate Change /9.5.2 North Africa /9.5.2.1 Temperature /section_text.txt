At 1.5°C, 2°C and 3°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels, mean annual temperatures in north Africa are projected to be on average, 0.9°C, 1.5°C and 2.6°C warmer than the 1994–2005 average, respectively (Figure 9.16a). Warming is projected to be stronger in summer than winter (Lelieveld et al., 2016; Dosio, 2017). The number of hot days is likely  to increase by up to 90% by the end of the century under RCP8.5 (global warming level [GWL] 4.4°C) (Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021) and hot nights and the duration of warm spells to increase in the first half of the 21st century in both intermediate and high-emission scenarios (Patricola and Cook, 2010; Vizy and Cook, 2012; Lelieveld et al., 2016; Dosio, 2017; Filahi et al., 2017). Heatwaves are projected to become more frequent and intense even at 1.5°C of global warming (Gutiérrez et al., 2021; Ranasinghe et al., 2021). Children born in 2020, under a 1.5°C-compatible scenario will be exposed to 4–6 times more heatwaves in their lifetimes compared to people born in 1960; this exposure increases to 9–10 times more heatwaves for emission reduction pledges, limiting global warming to 2.4°C (Thiery et al., 2021).
