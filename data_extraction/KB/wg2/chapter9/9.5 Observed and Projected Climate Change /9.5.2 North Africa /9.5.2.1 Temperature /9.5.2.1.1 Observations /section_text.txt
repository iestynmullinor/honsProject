Mean and seasonal temperatures have increased at twice the global rate over most regions in north Africa due to human-induced climate change (Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Figures 9.13a and; 9.14) (high confidence). Increasing temperature trends have been particularly strong since the 1970s (between 0.2°C per decade and 0.4°C per decade), especially in the summer (Tanarhte et al., 2012; Donat et al., 2014a; Lelieveld et al., 2016). Similar warming signals have been observed since the mid-1960s over the Sahara and the Sahel (Fontaine et al., 2013; Moron et al., 2016). Trends in mean maximum (TX) and minimum (TN) temperatures range between +2°C and +3°C per century over north Africa, and the frequencies of hot days (TX > 90th percentile, TX90p) and tropical nights (TN > 20°C), as well as the frequencies of warm days and nights, roughly follow these mean TX and TN trends (Fontaine et al., 2013; Moron et al., 2016; Ranasinghe et al., 2021; Seneviratne et al., 2021). Warm spell duration has increased in many north African countries (Donat et al., 2014a; Filahi et al., 2016; Lelieveld et al., 2016; Nashwan et al., 2018) and heatwave magnitude and spatial extent have increased across north Africa since 1980, with an increase in the number of events since 2000 that is beyond the level of natural climate variability (Russo et al., 2016; Ceccherini et al., 2017; Engdaw et al., 2021).
