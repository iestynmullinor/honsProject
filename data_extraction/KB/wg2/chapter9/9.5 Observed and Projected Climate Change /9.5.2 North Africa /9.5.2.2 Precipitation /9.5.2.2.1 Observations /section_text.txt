Mean annual precipitation decreased over most of north Africa between 1971–2000 (Donat et al., 2014a; Hertig et al., 2014; Nicholson et al., 2018; Zittis, 2018), with a gradual recovery to normal or wetter conditions in Algeria and Tunisia since 2000 and over Morocco since 2008 (Nouaceur and Murărescu, 2016). Since the 1960s days with more than 10 mm of rainfall have decreased and the number of consecutive dry days have increased in the eastern parts of north Africa, while in the western parts of north Africa heavy rainfall and flooding has increased (Donat et al., 2014a). Aridity, the ratio of potential evaporation to precipitation, has increased over the Mediterranean and north Africa due to significant decreases in precipitation (Greve et al., 2019).
