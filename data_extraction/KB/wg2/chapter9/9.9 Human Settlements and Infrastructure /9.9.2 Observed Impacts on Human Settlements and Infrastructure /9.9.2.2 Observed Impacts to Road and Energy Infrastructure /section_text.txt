The highest transport infrastructure exposures are from floods (Koks et al., 2019), with potentially severe consequences for food security (Fanzo et al., 2018), communication and the economy of affected regions (high confidence) (Koks et al., 2019). Eight of the 20 countries with the highest expected annual damages to road and rail assets, relative to the country’s GDP, are located in east, west and central Africa (Koks et al., 2019). Transport impacts compound climate impacts, such as heat stress and air pollution linked to vehicle emissions in Dar es Salaam (Ndetto and Matzarakis, 2014).African economies that rely primarily on hydropower for electricity generation are particularly sensitive to climate variability (Brooks, 2019). This sensitivity was already felt during the 2015/16 El Niño, in which Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe all experienced widespread and prolonged load shedding due to low rainfall. The impact was felt throughout the economy and reflected in reduced GDP growth in Zambia (Conway et al., 2017).
