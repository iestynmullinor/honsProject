The spatial distribution of climate hazards and observed impacts in terms of total people affected (displaced persons and deaths) during 2010–2020 is shown in Figure 9.27. From 2000–2019, floods and droughts accounted for 80% and 16%, respectively, of the 337 million affected persons, and a further 32% and 46%, respectively, of 46,078 deaths from natural disasters in Africa (CRED, 2019). Flooding is a major hazard across Africa (Kundzewicz et al., 2014; Douglas, 2017) and is increasing (Zevenbergen et al., 2016; Elboshy et al., 2019). An increase in extreme poverty and up to a 35% decrease in consumption has been associated with exposure to flood shocks (Azzarri and Signorelli, 2020). Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region globally that did not show decreasing rates of flood mortality since the 1990s (Tanoue et al., 2016). Economic opportunities, transportation of goods and services, and mobility and access to essential services, including health and education, are greatly hindered by flooding (Gannon et al., 2018). Severe impacts from tropical cyclone landfalls have been recorded in east and southeastern Africa (Rapolaki and Reason, 2018; Cambaza et al., 2019; Chatiza, 2019; Hope, 2019). Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in early 2019 caused flooding of districts in Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, with substantial loss and damage to infrastructure in the energy, transport, water supply, communication services, housing, health and education sectors, particularly in Mozambique (Figure 9.27; see also Cross-Chapter Box DISASTER in Chapter 4; Warren, 2019; Dube et al., 2021; Phiri et al., 2021).Figure 9.27 | From 2010–2020, over 166 million people were reported to be affected by climate hazards across Africa. Maps show (a)   location of all reported climate hazards; (b)   people affected by droughts; (c)   people affected by convective storms; (d)   people affected by floods, (e)   total deaths from tropical cyclones, and (f)   total deaths from heat waves. Source: EMDAT and CRED (2020). Note: Although extreme weather damage databases under-report heatwaves (which is indicated in panel  (f)  by very few deaths), the region has experienced a number of heatwaves and will be affected disproportionately by them in the future under climate change (Harrington and Otto, 2020).Open figure Table 9.7 | Case studies of  climate hazard impacts and risks to selected human settlements in AfricaHazardCountry/CityImpact on Human Settlement and InfrastructureSourceSea level rise and storm surgeEgypt(North Africa)December 2010, January 2011 and October 2015:  Storm surge of 1.2 m.a.s. l.

Around 40% of total drought-related displacements accommodated in Mogadishu, Baidoa, Kismayo; 60% hosted in other secondary cities. Increased population density and overcrowding in Somalia’s urban areas. Explosion of new shelters and tents for displaced persons within and in outskirts of cities.

Huge losses and damages to infrastructures in the energy, transport, water supply, communication services, housing, health and education sectors were also recorded.(Cambaza et al., 2019; Chatiza, 2019; Government of Mozambique, 2019; Hope, 2019; Lequechane et al., 2020; Phiri et al., 2021)(Enenkel et al., 2020)LandslideFreetown(West Africa)August, 2017: At least 500 people killed and over 600 people declared missing, >3000 residents rendered homeless; 349 houses destroyed.

Total damages in four west African countries (Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal and Togo) in 2017 were estimated at USD 850 million for pluvial floods and USD 555 million for fluvial floods (Croitoru et al., 2019). Unprecedented economic loss, in terms of goods and properties, estimated by the Nigerian insurance industry at USD 200 million resulted from floods in Lagos in 2011 (Adelekan, 2016). In southern Africa, the highest costs were incurred from flood losses during the period 2000–2015 (UNEP-FI, 2019b; Simpson, 2020).Business disruptions from climate impacts have implications for deepening poverty (Adelekan and Fregene, 2015). Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) employ 60–90% of workers in many African countries and contribute 40% or more to the GDP in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe (Muriithi, 2017). The viability of businesses and economic well-being of large populations employed in SMEs is severely affected by climate hazards as reported for local wind storms in Ibadan (Adelekan, 2012), El Niño-related flooding (Nairobi), drought-induced water supply disruption (Gaborone) and power outages (Lusaka) (Gannon et al., 2018). High water demand due to high rates of urbanisation and population growth, coupled with drought, reduce groundwater levels in cities (e.g., Bouake, Harare, Tripoli, Niamey) and increase saltwater intrusion into groundwater in coastal areas, reducing water availability and water security, particularly for poorer populations not connected to municipal water networks (Aswad et al., 2019; Claon et al., 2020).Evidence of the impact of heat waves in urban Africa in the current climate is sparse, due in part to low reporting and monitoring (Engelbrecht et al., 2015; Harrington and Otto, 2020). Knowledge is also limited on the interaction of climate change, urban growth and the urban heat island effect in Africa (Chapman et al., 2017). In north Africa, the present-day number of high heat stress nights is around 10 times larger in urban than rural areas (Fischer et al., 2012).
