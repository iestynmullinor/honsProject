Africaâ€™s smaller towns and cities have received far less scholarly and policy development attention for adaptation (Clapp and Pillay, 2017; White and Wahba, 2019). Smaller towns also have less ability to partner effectively with private entities for adaptation initiatives (Wisner et al., 2015). Political will to address climate change and information flows between key stakeholders, professional and political decision makers may be easier to establish in smaller cities than in the megacity context (Wisner et al., 2015).Exposure and vulnerability are particularly acute in informal areas, making coordinated adaptation challenging. Yet, there is growing recognition of the potential for bottom-up adaptation that embraces informality in order to more effectively reduce risk (Figure 9.31; Taylor et al., 2021a). This can provide an opportunity for change towards more risk-sensitive urban development and transformative climate adaptation (Leck et al., 2018). Addressing social vulnerability is particularly important for ensuring the resilience of populations at risk. Improved monitoring, modelling and communication of climate risks is needed to reduce the impacts of climate hazards (Tramblay et al., 2020; Cole et al., 2021a).Figure 9.31 | Key elements of adaptation in informal settlements in Africa.
