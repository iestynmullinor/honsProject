Higher costs will be incurred to maintain and repair damages caused to existing roads as a result of climate change for countries with no adaptation policy for transport infrastructure (very high confidence) (Chinowsky et al., 2013; Cervigni et al., 2017; Koks et al., 2019). Countries with a greater percentage of unpaved roads will, however, incur higher economic costs through adaptation policy when compared to no adaptation policy (Cervigni et al., 2017).Adaptation measures in the transport sector have focused on the climate resilience of road infrastructure. Modelling suggests that proactive adaptation of road designs to account for temperature increases is a ‘no regret’ option in all cases, but accounting for precipitation increases should be assessed on a case-by-case basis (medium confidence) (Cervigni et al., 2017). African governments will need climate adaptation financing options to meet the higher capital requirements of resilient road infrastructure interventions (Hearn, 2016).Under the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action programme, investments in public transport and transit-oriented development are highlighted as desired mitigation–adaptation interventions within cities of South Africa, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso (UNFCCC, 2020). These interventions simultaneously reduce the vulnerability of low-income residents to climate shocks, prevent lock-ins into carbon-intensive development pathways and reduce poverty (high confidence) (Hallegatte et al., 2016; Rozenberg et al., 2019). The combined mitigation–adaptation interventions in the land use transport systems of African cities are also expected to have sufficient short-term co-benefits (reducing air pollution, congestion and traffic fatalities) to be ‘no regret’ investments (very high confidence) (Hallegatte et al., 2016; Rozenberg et al., 2019). Only eight African countries have transport-specific adaptation measures in their NDCs (Nwamarah, 2018). Five African countries have submitted NAPs (Table 9.10).Table 9.10 | Transport sector references in the National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) of five African countries.
