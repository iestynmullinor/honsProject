Links between air quality and climate change are complex (Smith et al., 2014; Szopa et al., 2021). Increases in particulate matter concentrations are driven more by vehicle emissions, solid waste, biomass burning and development (Abera et al., 2021) than by climate change, and these factors vary widely across regions of the continent (West et al., 2013). Women and children who are exposed to high particulate matter concentrations when cooking indoors and HIV-infected people are more vulnerable to the health impacts of air pollution (Abera et al., 2021). Information on the direction of change of air quality in different African regions attributable to climate change are contradictory (Westervelt et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2017). Additionally, much uncertainty remains about interactions between air quality and climate change and relative impacts of different modes of development and climate change on pollutants. However, increasing temperatures combined with a reduction in rainfall are likely  to increase particulate matter concentrations (Abera et al., 2021), particularly in north Africa (Westervelt et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2017).Nevertheless, continued dependence on fossil-fuelled power plants will result in tens of thousands of avoidable deaths due to air pollution by 2030 (Marais and Wiedinmyer, 2016), and accelerate climate change. Actions to reduce air pollution can both mitigate climate change and have major co-benefits for health (West et al., 2013; Rao et al., 2016; Markandya et al., 2018; Rauner et al., 2020a; Rauner et al., 2020b) see also AR6 WGIII, Chapters 3, 4, 8 and 10). Investing in renewable energy resources rather than reliance on the combustion of fossil fuels would mark an important step forward for African population health (Marais et al., 2019). This is especially important in South Africa which emits approximately half the total carbon emissions for Africa, ranking 12th in the world for carbon emissions (Mohsin et al., 2019).Dust events in west Africa have severe health impacts (cardiorespiratory and infectious diseases, including meningitis) (Ayanlade et al., 2020) given the proximity of the Sahara, which produces about half of the yearly global mineral dust (de Longueville et al., 2013). Wildfires are projected to become the main source of particulate matter in west, central and southern Africa under both the lowest and highest future emissions scenarios, whereas, under intermediate scenarios (i.e., SSP3/RCP4.5), anthropogenic sources of particulate matter are projected to exceed that produced by wildfires (Knorr et al., 2017).
