Projected risks for malnutrition in Africa are high (FAO, 2016; see Section 9.8.1): 433 million people in Africa are anticipated to be undernourished by 2030 (FAO et al., 2020) and, compared to 1961–1990, 1.4 million additional African children will suffer from severe stunting by 2050 under 2.1°C global warming (WHO, 2014). In Burkina Faso, the mortality burden due to low crop yields could double by 2100 with 1.5°C of global warming (Belesova et al., 2019). Drought risks will include crop and livestock failures (Ahmadalipour et al., 2019). Additionally, increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 will affect the nutritional quality of C3 plant staples, lowering levels of protein and minerals like zinc and iron (Myers et al., 2014; Weyant et al., 2018). Declining fish catches due to ocean warming, illegal fishing and poor stock management are projected to increase deficiencies of zinc, iron and vitamin A for millions of people across Mozambique, Angola and multiple west African countries (see Section 9.8.5; Golden et al., 2016).
