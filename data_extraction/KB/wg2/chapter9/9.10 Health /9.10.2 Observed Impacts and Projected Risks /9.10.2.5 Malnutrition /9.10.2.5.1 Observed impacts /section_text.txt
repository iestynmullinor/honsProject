Africa has experienced the greatest impacts of climate change on acute food insecurity and malnutrition (FAO and ECA, 2018). Adverse climatic conditions exacerbate the impacts of an unstable global economy, conflict and pandemics on food insecurity (AfDB, 2018b; Food Security Information Network (FSIN), 2019; Fore et al., 2020; see Chapter 5 Section 5.12.4).More than 250 million Africans are undernourished, mostly in central and east Africa (FAO et al., 2020), which increases childhood stunting, affects cognition and has trans-generational sequelae (IFPRI, 2016; UNICEF et al., 2019). Undernutrition is strongly linked with hot climates (Hagos et al., 2014; Tusting et al., 2020). In Burkina Faso, low crop yields resulted in around 110 deaths per 10,000 children under 5 years, with 72% of this impact attributable to adverse climate conditions in the growing season (Belesova et al., 2019).Increasing incidence and expanded distributions of vector-borne livestock diseases (e.g., bluetongue, trypanosomiasis and RVF) in response to changes in rainfall and increasing temperatures, undermine food security, especially among subsistence farmers (Samy and Peterson, 2016; Caminade et al., 2019). Locust infestations linked with changes in climate (Salih et al., 2020) are a major risk for food security in Africa.
