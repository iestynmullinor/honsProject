The intersections between climate change and human health involve interactions of numerous systems and sectors (Lindley et al., 2019; Yokohata et al., 2019). This complexity means that holistic, transdisciplinary and cross-sectoral (systems) approaches like One Health, EcoHealth and Planetary Health can improve the long-term effectiveness of responses to health risks (Zinsstag, 2012; Whitmee et al., 2015; Nantima et al., 2019). More research is needed to identify sustainable solutions (Rother et al., 2020), as recently re-emphasised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity in its report on the COVID-19 pandemic (IPBES, 2020). The close dependency of many Africans on their livestock and surrounding ecosystems forms a context where integrated health approaches are especially critical for addressing climate change risks to health (Figure Box 9.7.1; Watts et al., 2015; Cissé, 2019).Integrated approaches to health in Africa can deliver multiple benefits for humans and ecosystems For example, rather than addressing micronutrient deficiencies with supplements, which may not be accepted culturally and can be disrupted by stockouts or similar, addressing nutrient deficiencies in staple crops by selecting or breeding more nutritious varieties (e.g., orange-fleshed sweet potatoes or ‘golden rice’ for vitamin A deficiency) may prove to be more sustainable options (Datta et al., 2003; Nair et al., 2016; Laurie et al., 2018; Oduor et al., 2019; Stokstad, 2019). Additionally, some micro- or macronutrient deficiencies and food insecurities may be improved by addressing the depletion of soils through better management, including the incorporation of holistic, sustainable principles, such as those promoted by agroforestry or regenerative agriculture (Rhodes, 2017; Elevitch et al., 2018; LaCanne and Lundgren, 2018; Chapter 5 Section 5.12.4).Figure Box 9.7.1 |  Human, ecosystem and animal health are intimately interlinked, and require transdisciplinary approaches such as One Health, EcoHealth and Planetary Health for effective, sustainable, long-term management. This schematic shows some examples of these interlinkages, and how they impact human health, highlighting the complex interactions and the importance of holistic, systems approaches to health interventions, including for climate change adaptation.
