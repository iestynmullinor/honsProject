Poor populations in the western Sahel have the highest burden of bacterial meningitis worldwide, with seasonal dynamics driven by the dry Harmattan winds that transport dust long distances across the continent (Agier et al., 2013; García-Pando et al., 2014). In Nigeria, rising temperatures are projected to increase meningitis cases by about 50% for 1.8°C global warming (RCP2.6 in 2060–2075), and by almost double for 3.4°C global warming (RCP8.5 in 2060–2075) (Abdussalam et al., 2014). Bilharzia is also highly climate sensitive, with its distribution influenced by changes in temperature and precipitation, as well as development, such as the introduction of freshwater projects (e.g., canals, hydroelectric dams and irrigation schemes) (Adekiya et al., 2019).Figure 9.34 | Schematic showing the pathways of impact for heat-related morbidities in Africa as a result of exposure to climate hazards. Numbers in the figure refer to chapter sections of this report. Indirect health impacts of heat are not shown. For example, risk of malnutrition from reduced crop yields or reduced fisheries catches (see Section 9.8.5).Open figure
