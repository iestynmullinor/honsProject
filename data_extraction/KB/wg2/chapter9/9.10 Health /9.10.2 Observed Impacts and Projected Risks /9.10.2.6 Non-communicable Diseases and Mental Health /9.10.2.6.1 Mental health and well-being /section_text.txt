Mental health and well-being are affected by local climate conditions and are therefore sensitive to climate change (Burke et al., 2018b; Obradovich et al., 2018). High temperatures are strongly associated with poor mental health and suicide in South Africa (Kim et al., 2019). Exposure to extreme heat directly influences emotional control, aggression and violent behaviour, escalating rates of interpersonal violence, with homicides rising by as much as 18% in South Africa when temperatures are above 30°C compared with temperatures below 20°C (Burke et al., 2015a; Chersich et al., 2019b; Gates et al., 2019).Extreme weather events are often severely detrimental to mental health (Scheerens et al., 2020), with elevated rates of anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in impacted individuals (Schlenker and Lobell, 2010; Nuvey et al., 2020). Youths may be at especially high risk (Barkin et al., 2021).Loss of livestock from disease or lack of pastures is strongly linked with poor mental health among farmers (Nuvey et al., 2020). Climate change impacts on mental health among refugees is concerning but remains under-researched (Matlin et al., 2018).
