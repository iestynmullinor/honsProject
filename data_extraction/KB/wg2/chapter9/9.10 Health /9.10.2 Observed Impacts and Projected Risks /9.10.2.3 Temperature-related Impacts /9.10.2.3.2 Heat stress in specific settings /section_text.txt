Heat stress symptoms are prevalent among people in buildings that are poorly ventilated or insulated, or constructed with unsuitable materials (e.g., corrugated metal sheeting). These features are common to many structures in Africa, including slums, informal and low-income settlements, as well as schools and healthcare facilities (Bidassey-Manilal et al., 2016; Naicker et al., 2017; Wright et al., 2019). Temperatures inside these structures can exceed outdoor temperatures by 4°C or more and have large diurnal fluctuations (Mabuya and Scholes, 2020). Daily wage labourers and residents of urban informal settlements are among the most vulnerable to heat stress because of the urban heat island effect, with congestion, and inadequate ventilation, shade, open space and vegetation (Bartlett, 2008) being associated with impacts of both hot and cold conditions on public health (Ramin, 2009). Temperature extremes are expected to result in relatively more deaths in informal settlements than in other settlement types (Scovronick and Armstrong, 2012).The urban heat island effect exacerbates current and projected heat stress in Africa’s rapidly growing cities (Mitchell, 2016) and is discussed in more detail in Section 9.9.3.Escalating temperatures and longer-duration heatwaves are expected to heavily affect workers already exposed to extreme temperatures, for example, outdoor workers (Kjellstrom et al., 2018) and miners (El-Shafei et al., 2018; Nunfam et al., 2019a; Nunfam et al., 2019b). Vulnerability may also be high for women who cook food for a living, and children who accompany them, due to prolonged exposure to high temperatures (Parmar et al., 2019). Prisons, commonly poorly ventilated and overcrowded, are also high-risk settings (Van Hout and Mhlanga-Gunda, 2019).
