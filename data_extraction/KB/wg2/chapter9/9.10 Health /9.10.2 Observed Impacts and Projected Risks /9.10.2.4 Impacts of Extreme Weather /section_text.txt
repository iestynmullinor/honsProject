During extreme conditions, for example, Cyclone Kenneth (Codjoe et al., 2020) and El Niño 2015–2016 (WHO, 2016; Pozniak et al., 2020), direct physical injury, loss of life, destruction of property and population displacement can occur. Flooding and landslides are common after extreme rainfall and are the most frequently described impact of climate variability in Africa’s cities currently, with residents of poorly serviced or informal settlements most vulnerable (Hunter et al., 2020). Post-traumatic stress disorders in affected individuals are common, including in children (Rother, 2020). In rural areas, the resulting damage to health facilities, access routes and transport services can severely compromise health service delivery (WHO, 2016). The effects of extreme weather on urban health infrastructure depends on the characteristics, location and adaptive capacity of cities (see Section 9.9.4).
