The social determinants of health are ‘the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age’ as well as the drivers of these, including the social circumstances which profoundly affect health and drive health disparities (Commission of Social Determinants of Health, 2008; Gurewich et al., 2020). Social features (e.g., health-related behaviours), socioeconomic factors (e.g., income, wealth and education) and environmental determinants (e.g., air or water quality) are critical for shaping health outcomes. These factors are inextricably linked (Schulz and Northridge, 2004; Moore and Diaz, 2015) and are largely outside the domain of the health sector. Climate change is already challenging the health and well-being of African communities, compounding the effects of underlying inequalities (high confidence). The interlinkage between climate change and social determinants of health are largely discussed at a global level (Commission of Social Determinants of Health, 2008), or for developed countries (Ahdoot et al., 2015; Levy and Patz, 2015; Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2016), with scant evidence for Africa. Nevertheless, there is robust evidence that the health impacts of climate change disproportionately affect the poorest people and children and, in some situations, can differ by gender and age (St Louis and Hess, 2008; Nyahunda et al., 2020; Ragavan et al., 2020; see Box 9.1). Unequal access to health care particularly affects rural communities (Falchetta et al., 2020), vulnerable women and children (Wigley et al., 2020a) and challenges the achievement of development priorities such as universal health care access (SDG 3) (Weiss et al., 2020).
