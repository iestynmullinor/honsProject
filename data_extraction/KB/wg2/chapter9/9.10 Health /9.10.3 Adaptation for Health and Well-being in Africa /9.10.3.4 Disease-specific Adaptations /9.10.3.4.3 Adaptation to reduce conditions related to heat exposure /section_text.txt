Reducing morbidity and mortality during extreme heat events requires changes in behaviour and health promotion initiatives, health system interventions and modifications to the built and natural environment. Health promotion initiatives include promoting adequate hydration and simple cooling measures, such as drinking cold liquids, water sprays and raising awareness of the symptoms and importance of heat stress, including heatstroke (Aljawabra and Nikolopoulou, 2018). Adaptive measures are especially important for high-risk groups such as outdoor workers, the elderly, pregnant women and infants. Health systems interventions may include early warning systems, heat health regulation and health workers providing cooling interventions, such as supplying cool water or fans, during heat waves. Changes to the built environment include painting the roofs of houses white and improving ventilation during extreme heat (Codjoe et al., 2020), the use of insulation materials or altering the building materials used for the construction of housing to improve their ability to moderate indoor temperatures (Mathews et al., 1995; Makaka and Meyer, 2006).
