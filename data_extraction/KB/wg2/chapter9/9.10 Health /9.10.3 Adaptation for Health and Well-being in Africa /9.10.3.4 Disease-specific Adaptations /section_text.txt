Transformative adaptation requires integration of resilience and mitigation across all parts of the food system including production, supply chains, social aspects and dietary choices (IPCC, 2019a). Adaptation to prevent malnutrition goes hand-in-hand with adaptation to prevent food insecurity, as is discussed in Section 9.8.3; Chapter 5 Section 5.12.5.Urban agriculture and forestry can improve nutrition and food security, household income and mental health of urban farmers while mitigating against some of the impacts of climate change, like flooding and landslides (by stabilising the soil and reducing runoff, for example), heat (by providing shade and through evapotranspiration) and diversifying food sources in case of drought (Zezza and Tasciotti, 2010; Lwasa et al., 2014; Battersby and Hunter-Adams, 2020).The health sector needs to collaborate and coordinate adaptation activities with other sectors, as well as civil society and international agencies, to engage communities in health promotion (Irwin et al., 2006; Commission of Social Determinants of Health, 2008; Braveman and Gottlieb, 2014). The importance of social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic status, education and the physical environment in which people live and work and their consideration during development are highlighted in Chapter 7 (see Sections 7.1.6; 7.4.2)
