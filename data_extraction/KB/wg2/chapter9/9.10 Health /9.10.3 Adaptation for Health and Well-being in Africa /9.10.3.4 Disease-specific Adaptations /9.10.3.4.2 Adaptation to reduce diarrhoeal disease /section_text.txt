Reducing pathogen concentrations in water and across food chains is fundamental for controlling diarrhoeal diseases (van den Berg et al., 2019). Diarrhoea prevention and treatment post-disaster, encompass social mobilisation campaigns, water treatment, enhanced surveillance, and vaccination and treatment centres for cholera (Cambaza et al., 2019) and typhoid (Neuzil et al., 2019).Improved WASH requires robust water and sanitation infrastructure (Duncker, 2017; Kohlitz et al., 2017; Venema and Temmer, 2017) and technological adaptations (Gabert, 2016; van Wyk et al., 2017), such as waterless on-site sanitation (Sutherland et al., 2021), diversification of water sources (e.g., rainwater harvesting (Lasage and Verburg, 2015) and groundwater abstraction (MacDonald et al., 2012)), and sharing of best practices across the continent (WASH Alliance International, 2015; Jack et al., 2016; see also Section 9.7.3; Chapter 4 Section 4.6.4). Hand hygiene can be improved through the creation of handwashing stations, increased access to soap and simple technologies such as the foot-operated Tippy taps (Coultas and Iyer, 2020; Mbakaya et al., 2020).
