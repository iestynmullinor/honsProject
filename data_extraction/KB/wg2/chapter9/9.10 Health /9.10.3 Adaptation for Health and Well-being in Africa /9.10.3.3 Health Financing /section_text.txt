Poor and low-income households often are not able to afford high out-of-pocket costs for medical care, or it consumes a large portion of their income. As a result, without financial aid, peoples’ health needs may not be met after a climate shock (Hallegatte and Rozenberg, 2017). Microfinance (the provision of small-scale financial products to low income and otherwise disadvantaged groups by financial institutions) and disaster contingency funds can serve to reduce health risks of climate change for low-income communities (Agrawala and Carraro, 2010; Ozaki, 2016), as can different forms of insurance and disaster relief (Fenton et al., 2015; Dowla, 2018). Unconditional cash transfers in Kenya, Uganda and Zambia assisted vulnerable groups to absorb the negative impacts of climate-related shocks or stress and to prepare for these (Lawlor et al., 2019; Ulrichs et al., 2019). Based on several case studies in Africa, the Food and Agriculture Organization recommends a ‘Cash+’ approach which combines cash transfers with productive assets, inputs or technical training to address the needs of vulnerable households in emergency situations, and enhance livelihoods potential, income generation and food security (FAO, 2017). New economic models have been implemented in north Africa, focused on poor households, youth and women that enable access to credit and support the implementation of policies that balance cash and food crops, social safety nets and social protection (Mumtaz and Whiteford, 2017; Narayanan and Gerber, 2017; see also Sections 9.4; 9.8; 9.11).
