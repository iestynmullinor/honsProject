Increased awareness can facilitate community engagement and action (see Section 9.4.3). In Ghana, for example, local communities understand the climate hazards that drive outbreaks of meningitis and adapt accordingly by improving housing to limit heat and exposure, changing funeral practices during outbreaks, increased vaccination uptake and afforestation (Codjoe and Nabie, 2014). Similarly, participation in community organisations improved child nutrition in vulnerable rural households in Eswatini (Anchang et al., 2019). Interventions specifically targeting women are beneficial for food security, although they may be undermined by harmful gender norms in communities that are patriarchal, led by chiefs or have high rates of gender-based violence (Jaka and Shava, 2018; Kita, 2019; Masson et al., 2019). The BRACED project in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia specifically adopted a gender-transformative approach as an integral part of resilience building (McOmber et al., 2019). Improving ‘climate literacy’ could empower youth, women and men to be active citizens in promoting adherence of governments to international agreements in climate change (Mudombi et al., 2017; Chersich et al., 2019a).
