Future warming will have negative consequences for economic growth in Africa, relative to a future without additional climate change and assuming current levels of adaptation (high confidence) (Dell et al., 2012; 2015a; Burke et al., 2015b; Acevedo et al., 2017; Baarsch et al., 2020). Statistically based empirical analyses project that global warming of 2.3°C by 2050 could lower GDP per capita across sub-Saharan Africa by 12% (SSP2) (Baarsch et al., 2020) and 80% for warming >4°C by 2100 (SSP5, 75% for MENA) (Burke et al., 2015b). Depending on the future socioeconomic scenario, this could increase global inequality and leave some African countries poorer than at present (Burke et al., 2015b). Inequalities between African countries are projected to widen under climate change, with negative impacts estimated to be largest in west and east Africa (Baarsch et al., 2020). While negative impacts across African economies are highly likely  under climate change, precise magnitudes are debated in the literature. Alternative statistical analyses suggest a 12% reduction of GDP per capita by 2100 under RCP8.5 across African countries relative to a future without climate change (Kahn et al., 2021), while computable general equilibrium models generate smaller damages as well, ranging from 3.8% reduction across sub-Saharan Africa in 2060 under warming of 2.5°C (Dellink et al., 2019) to 12% across all of Africa in 2100 under warming of 5°C (SSP4) (Takakura et al., 2019).Substantial avoided economic damages to African countries are projected from ambitious, near-term global mitigation limiting global warming well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels (high confidence). Increased economic damage forecasts for Africa under high emissions scenarios start diverging rapidly from low emissions scenarios by the 2030s (Baarsch et al., 2020). Across nearly all African countries, GDP per capita is projected to be at least 5% higher by 2050 and 10–20% higher by 2100 if global warming is held to 1.5°C versus 2°C (Burke et al., 2018a; Baarsch et al., 2020) (Figure 9.37). The probability of this positive gain to GDP per capita from achieving 1.5°C versus 2°C is reported as close to 100% (Burke et al., 2018a). While these estimates rely on temperature and rainfall-driven damages, SLR also poses a risk for Africa. By 2050, damages from SLR across sub-Saharan Africa could reach 2–4% of GDP, depending on the socioeconomic, adaptation and emissions scenario (Parrado et al., 2020).Heat stress is projected to reduce working hours and work capacity under climate change, with among the largest declines in sub-Saharan Africa and for workers in vulnerable occupation groups, such as those working outdoors (Kjellstrom et al., 2014; 2016; de Lima et al., 2021; Chapter 5). Global warming of 3°C is projected to reduce labour capacity in agriculture by 30–50% in sub-Saharan Africa (relative to the baseline in 1986–2005) (de Lima et al., 2021). These effects lead to substantial aggregate losses, for example, in west Africa, labour productivity impacts under a 3°C temperature increase are estimated to cost up to 8% of GDP (Roson and Sartori, 2016). Manufacturing productivity across Africa is projected to decline under RCP8.5 by 0–15% by 2080–2099, with the largest effects in the DRC, Ethiopia, Somalia, Mozambique and Malawi (Nath, 2020).Large risks to road, rail and water infrastructure are projected from climate change with substantial economic cost implications (see Section 9.9.3; Box 9.5).
