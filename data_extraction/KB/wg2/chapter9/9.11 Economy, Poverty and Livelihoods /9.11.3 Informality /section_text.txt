Aggregate GDP data capture formal economic activity but informal employment is the main source of employment in Africa, accounting for 85.8% of all employment (71.9%, excluding agriculture), which is 21.4% higher than the global average (ILO, 2018b). Estimates of national levels of informal employment range from 30% in South Africa, to 94.6% in Burkina Faso (ILO, 2018b), with high variability within countries such as South Africa and Nigeria (Etim and Daramola, 2020). Informal employment is a greater source of employment for women than for men in sub-Saharan Africa and young and old have especially high rates of informal employment: 94.9% of persons between ages 15 and 24 in employment and 96% of persons aged 65 and older (ILO, 2018b).Informal sector impacts are omitted from GDP-based impacts projections. Yet, informal sector activity and small to medium-sized enterprises can be highly exposed to climate extremes, as they are often located in low-lying areas, coastal areas, sloped or other hazardous zones (Thorn et al., 2015; Satterthwaite et al., 2020). Businesses and individuals in the informal sector, including construction workers, domestic workers, street vendors and transport workers, often cannot operate during climate shocks due to interruptions in transportation and commodity flows and, without the ability to insure against risk, struggle to recover assets from extreme events such as flooding, landslides and waterlogging (Chen, 2014; Thorn et al., 2015; Roy et al., 2018a). Women are overrepresented in the more poorly remunerated sections of the informal economy (Satterthwaite et al., 2020).There is scope for governments to better harness the role of the informal sector in mitigation and adaptation (Douxchamps et al., 2015; Satterthwaite et al., 2020). Multi-level governance that includes informal service providers, such as informal water and sanitation networks, into planned adaptation programmes can increase climate resilience, in part because these networks can respond with more flexibility than hard infrastructure projects (Satterthwaite et al., 2020; Peirson and Ziervogel, 2021). Climate risk is often concentrated in urban informal settlements (Section 9.9.4). Here, informal land markets influence development patterns and can help ensure adherence to building codes to ensure safety of informally built structures at high risks of landslides and floods and enforce compliance with regulations relating to planning and land use (Thorn et al., 2015; Satterthwaite et al., 2020). Improving land management practices of charcoal producers and artisanal gold miners, combined with appropriate alternative livelihood and energy sources, can reduce emissions and increase resilience (e.g., reduce erosion and sedimentation, increase water infiltration) and benefit health (Atteridge, 2013; Paz et al., 2015; Macháček, 2019; Barenblitt et al., 2021; Eniola, 2021). Providing concessional loans, commercial financing or equity investment to informal brick makers can boost delivery of low emission social housing while the use of crop residues or renewable energy for brick making can replace wood biomass and reduce pressure on forests (Alam, 2006; Paz et al., 2015).
