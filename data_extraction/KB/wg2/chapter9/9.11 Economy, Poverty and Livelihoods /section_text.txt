Climatic conditions are important drivers of migration and displacement with migration responses to climate hazards strongly influenced by economic, social, political and demographic processes (Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7).Most climate-related migration and displacement observed currently is within countries or between neighbouring countries, rather than to more geographically distant high-income countries (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020). Natural disaster-related displacements in sub-Saharan Africa were over 2.6 million in 2018 and 3.4 million in 2019 (13.9% of the global total and one of the highest historical figures for the region), with east (1,437,7000) and west Africa (798,000) being hotspots in 2018 (Table Box 9.8.1; Mastrorillo et al., 2016; IDMC, 2019; IDMC, 2020). Estimates indicate future climate change effects on internal migration in Africa will be considerable (Table Box 9.8.1;Rigaud et al., 2018).Internal migration, displacement and urbanisationClimate change can have opposing influences on migration flows. Deteriorating economic conditions caused by climate hazards can encourage out-migration (Wiederkehr et al., 2018). However, these same economic losses undermine household resources needed to migrate (Cattaneo and Peri, 2016). The net effect of these two forces leads to mixed results across study methodologies and contexts (Carleton and Hsiang, 2016; Borderon et al., 2019; Cattaneo et al., 2019; Hoffmann et al., 2020).Urbanisation in Africa is affected by climate conditions in rural agricultural areas (high confidence). Urbanisation can increase when reduced moisture availability depresses farm incomes or pastoral livelihoods become unviable (Marchiori et al., 2012; Henderson et al., 2014; Mastrorillo et al., 2016). The influence of rainfall on rural–urban migration increased since decolonisation, possibly due to more lenient legislation on internal mobility, with each 1% reduction in precipitation below a long-term average associated with a 0.45% increase in urbanisation (Barrios et al., 2006). The rate of rural–urban migration is anticipated to increase (Neumann et al., 2015) as a result of increasing vulnerability of agricultural livelihoods to climate change (Serdeczny et al., 2017). Nevertheless, rural–urban migration is not a simple one-way process. Peri-urban and rural areas provide developmental feedback loops, helping create a ‘regional agglomeration’ effect, for instance, through growing food demand, family and social connections, and flows back to rural areas of goods and services and financial investments (UN-Habitat, 2016; Dodman et al., 2017).Migration is an important and potentially effective climate change adaptation strategy in Africa and must be considered in adaptation planning (high confidence)  (Williams et al., 2021). The more agency migrants have (that is, degree of voluntarity and freedom of movement), the greater the potential benefits for sending and receiving areas (high agreement, medium evidence) (Cross-Chapter Box MIGRATE in Chapter 7). In a synthesis of 63 studies covering over 9700 rural households in dryland sub-Saharan Africa, 23% of households employed migration (primarily temporary economic) to adapt to changes in rainfed agriculture (Wiederkehr et al., 2018). Migration responses to climate change tend to be stronger among wealthier households, as poorer households often lack financial resources necessary to migrate (Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer, 2020).International migrationStudies on propensity to emigrate have uncovered conflicting results. Some findings suggest in low-income countries high temperatures ‘trap’ people at home and lower migration rates abroad, but in middle-income countries, these same high temperatures encourage emigration (Cattaneo and Peri, 2016). However, other research finds in poor and agriculturally dependent countries, high temperatures encourage international out-migration, particularly to the OECD (Cai et al., 2016). Some evidence indicates people who leave tend to be more educated, possibly leading to ‘brain drain’ (Mbaye, 2017). Recent evidence suggests hotter-than-normal temperatures across 103 countries, including many in Africa, increased asylum applications to the European Union (Missirian and Schlenker, 2017). Assuming no change in present-day vulnerability, asylum applications are projected to increase 34% across Africa (relative to 2000–2014) at 2.2°C global warming (Missirian and Schlenker, 2017), although this finding has been challenged in the literature (Abel et al., 2019; Boas et al., 2019).International remittances are a vital resource for developing countries that can help aid recovery from climate shocks (Hallegatte et al. 2016). Estimated at USD 48 billion in 2019 their importance is expected to grow further due to foreign direct investment declines during the COVID-19 pandemic (World Bank, 2020a). Furthermore, domestic remittances from rural–urban migration can help rural households respond to climate risks (KNOMAD, 2016). However, adequate finance and banking infrastructure are essential for remittances and, on average, cash transfer costs for sub-Saharan African countries remain the highest globally (World Bank, 2020a). Mobile money technologies and regulation that promotes competition in the remittances market can reduce transaction costs (World Bank, 2020a). Governments can further address challenges facing internal and international migrants by including them in health services and other social programmes and protecting them from discrimination (World Bank, 2020a).Box 9.8Table Box 9.8.1 | Reported impacts of climate on migration in Africa.

Projections are for internal migration driven by three slow-onset climate hazards (water stress, crop failure and SLR), and excluding rapid-onset hazards such as floods and tropical cyclones. As such, they present a lower-bound estimate of potential climate change impacts on internal migration. Projections are for two warming scenarios: low emissions (RCP2.6) and high emissions (RCP8.5), both coupled with a socioeconomic pathway (SSP4) in which low-income countries have high population growth, high rates of urbanisation, and increasing inequality within and among countries. By 2050, between 17.4 million (RCP2.6) and 85 million (RCP8.5) people (up to 4% of the region’s total population) could be moving as a consequence of climate impacts on water stress, crop productivity and SLR. More inclusive socioeconomic pathways with lower population growth are projected to reduce these risks. West Africa has the highest levels of climate migrants, potentially reaching more than 50 million, suggesting that climate impacts will have a particularly pronounced impact on future migration in the region. In east Africa, out-migration hotspots include coastal regions of Kenya and Tanzania, western Uganda and parts of the northern highlands of Ethiopia. Kampala, Nairobi and Lilongwe may become hotspots of climate in-migration, coupled with existing rural to urban migration trends, and a high likelihood of movement toward non-climate-related sources of income in cities.
