Understanding the human cause of climate change is a strong predictor of climate change risk perception (Lee et al., 2015) and a critical knowledge foundation that can affect the difference between coping responses and more informed and transformative adaptation (Figure 9.11; Oladipo, 2015; Mutandwa et al., 2019). At a minimum, climate change literacy includes both having heard of climate change and understanding it is, at least in part, caused by people (Simpson et al., 2021a). However, large inequalities in climate change literacy exist between and within countries and communities across Africa.The average national climate change literacy rate in Africa is only 39% (country rates range from 23â€“66%) (Figure 9.11). Of 394 sub-national regions surveyed by Afrobarometer, 8% (37 regions in 16 countries) have a climate change literacy rate lower than 20%, while only 2% (8 regions) score higher than 80%, which is common across European countries (Simpson et al., 2021a). Striking differences exist when comparing sub-national units within countries. Climate change literacy rates in Nigeria range from 71% in Kwara to 5% in Kano, and within Botswana from 69% in Lobatse to only 6% in Kweneng West (Simpson et al., 2021a). Education is the strongest positive predictor of climate change literacy, particularly tertiary education, but poverty decreases climate change literacy and climate change literacy rates average 12.8% lower for women than men (Simpson et al., 2021a).As the identified factors driving climate change literacy overlap with broader developmental challenges on the continent, policies targeting these factors (e.g., increased education) can potentially yield co-benefits for both climate change adaptation as well as progress towards SDGs, particularly education and gender equality (Simpson et al., 2021a). Progress towards greater climate change literacy affords a concrete opportunity to mainstream climate change within core national and sub-national developmental agendas in Africa towards more CRD pathways. Synergies with CS can also overcome gendered deficits, for example, although women are generally less climate change aware and more vulnerable to climate change than men in Africa, they are generally more likely to adopt climate-resilient crops when they are climate change aware and have exposure to extension services (Acevedo et al., 2020; Simpson et al., 2021a).
