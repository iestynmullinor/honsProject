Laws are now being developed to formalise and entrench institutional structures, specifying their mandate, function, membership and related procedures. A useful example of such an approach can be found in the Nigerian Climate Change Bill which establishes the National Climate Council on Climate Change headed and chaired by the Vice-President, with a wide membership of ministers, the Chairmen of the Governors’ Forum and Association of Local Governments, as well as the private sector and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives.Climate change framework laws can play an instrumental role in achieving mainstreaming by directing relevant actors to integrate adaptation considerations into existing mandates, operations and planning instruments (Rumble, 2019). By way of example, the South African Draft Climate Change Bill contains a general duty to ‘coordinate and harmonise the policies, plans, programmes and decisions of the national, provincial and local spheres of government’ to achieve, among other things, the climate change objectives of the Bill and national adaptation objectives.Another common theme is the requirement to develop national climate change adaptation strategies and plans. Many laws further entrench their longevity by requiring them to be subject to strong community participation and consultation, as demonstrated by the Kenyan Climate Change Act and the Nigerian Climate Change Bill.
