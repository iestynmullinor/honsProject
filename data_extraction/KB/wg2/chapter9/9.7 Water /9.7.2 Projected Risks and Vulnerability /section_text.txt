Climate change is projected to reduce water availability and increase the extent of water scarcity (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016), particularly in southern and north Africa, while other regions will be more affected by increased hydrological variability over temporally short to interannual time scales (see Section 9.6.2). African countries are considered to be particularly at risk due to their underlying vulnerabilities (IPCC, 2014b; UNESCO and UN-Water, 2020), yet the continents’ water resources are still inadequately quantified and modelled (Müller Schmied et al., 2016; Reinecke et al., 2019), constraining sustainable management practices (Cuthbert et al., 2019; Hughes, 2019).Hydrological fluctuations are associated with drought, flood and cyclone events which have had multi-sector impacts across Africa (Siderius et al., 2021; see Chapter 4 Sections 4.3; 4.5), including: reduced crop production (D’Odorico et al., 2018), migration and displacement (Siam and Eltahir, 2017; IDMC, 2018), food insecurity and extensive livestock deaths (Nhamo et al., 2018), electricity outages (Gannon et al., 2018), increased incidence of cholera (Olago et al., 2007; Sorensen et al., 2015; Houéménou et al., 2020) and increased groundwater abstraction amplifying the risk of saline intrusion from sea level rise (Hamed et al., 2018; Ouhamdouch et al., 2019).The literature shows significant gender-differentiated vulnerability and intersectional vulnerability to climate change impacts on water in Africa (Fleifel et al., 2019; Grasham et al., 2019; Mackinnon et al., 2019; Dickin et al., 2020; Lund Schlamovitz and Becker, 2020), although studies are generally lacking in northern Africa (Daoud, 2021). Women and girls are, in most cases, more impacted than men and boys by customary water practices, as adult females are the primary water collectors (46% in Liberia to 90% in Cote d’Ivoire), while more female than male children are associated with water collection (62% compared with 38%, respectively) (Graham et al., 2016). Women and girls face barriers toward accessing basic sanitation and hygiene resources, and 71% of studies reported a negative health outcome, reflecting a water–gender–health nexus (Pouramin et al., 2020). These differential vulnerabilities are crucial for informing adaptation, but are still relatively under-researched, more so for the urban poor than rural communities (Grasham et al., 2019; Mackinnon et al., 2019; Lund Schlamovitz and Becker, 2020).
