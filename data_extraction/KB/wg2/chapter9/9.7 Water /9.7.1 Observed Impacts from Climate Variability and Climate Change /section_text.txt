Climate impacts on water are occurring against a backdrop of increasing temperatures and changes in rainfall, with increased seasonal and interannual variability, droughts in some regions, and increased frequency of heavy rainfall events (see Section 9.5). In west Africa, declines in river flows have been attributed to declining rainfall and increasing temperature, drought frequency and water demand (Biao, 2017; Thompson et al., 2017; Descroix et al., 2018). In central Africa, the Congo river demonstrates inter-decadal shifts but no long-term trend (Mahe et al., 2013; Alsdorf et al., 2016). However, recently observed falling water levels in its upper and middle reaches are attributed to climate change (von Lossow, 2017).A review of river flow and lake level changes in 82 basins in eastern and southern Africa regions for 1970–2010 showed mixed trends: 51% had decreasing trends ranging from 10–49% and 11% increasing trends ranging from 7–60% (Schäfer et al., 2015). However, in southern Africa as a whole, river flows have mostly decreased (high confidence) (Dallas and Rivers-Moore, 2014). In east Africa, large rivers such as the Tana show increasing flow (1941–2016) related to increased rainfall in the highlands, with little influence of flow regulation by a series of dams (Langat et al., 2017). The Nile river basin has been experiencing a mainly increasing rainfall trend upstream and decreasing trend downstream (Onyutha et al., 2016). The observed changes are driven by a complex coupling of changes in climate, land use and water demand.Observed climate changes in Africa (see Section 9.5) have led to changes in river flow and runoff (Dallas and Rivers-Moore, 2014; Wolski et al., 2014) and high fluctuations in lake levels (high confidence) (Natugonza et al., 2016; Ogutu-Ohwayo et al., 2016; Gownaris et al., 2018). Shallow lakes respond dramatically to hydrological changes, for example, Lake Chilwa has dried up completely nine times in the last century (Wilson, 2014), while Lake Chad shrunk by 90% between 1963 and 2000 (Gao et al., 2011). However, recent analyses indicate that Lake Chad’s water levels have been stable since 2000 due to infilling from groundwater resources (Buma et al., 2018; Pham-Duc et al., 2020). Other factors such as deforestation and increased water use in upstream tributaries also contribute to lake shrinking (Mvula et al., 2014). Water levels in Kenya’s mostly shallow rift lakes have been rising since 2010, with some exceeding historical record high levels (Schagerl and Renaut, 2016; Olago et al., 2021). The recent 10-year rising trend is partly attributed to increased rainfall and changing land uses (Onywere et al., 2012; Olago et al., 2021). Changes in water level fluctuations of 13 African lakes have been positively correlated with primary and overall production (Gownaris et al., 2018), and will have important consequences for freshwater ecosystems and related ecosystem goods and services (see Sections 9.6.1.3; 9.8.5). Other effects of observed climate changes in Africa include higher episodic groundwater recharge, particularly in drylands, from heavy rainfall events that are in some cases related to ENSO and the IOD (Taylor et al., 2013; Fischer and Knutti, 2016; Cuthbert et al., 2019; Kotchoni et al., 2019; Myhre et al., 2019), reduced soil moisture, more frequent and intense floods, more persistent and frequent droughts (Douville et al., 2021) and the steady decline and projected disappearance by 2040 of African tropical glaciers (see Section 9.5.9).The mixed signal in river flow trends (increase/decrease/no change) across Africa mirrors the results seen globally for runoff and streamflow (see Chapter 4 Section 4.2.3). Hydrological extremes are, however, of increasing concern. There has been an increase in drought frequency, severity and spatial extent in recent decades. From 1900–2013, Africa suffered the largest number of drought events globally and registered the second largest number of people affected after Asia (Masih et al., 2014). The likelihood of recent severe climate conditions such as the multi-year Cape Town drought has increased due to human-caused climate change (Otto et al., 2018; Pascale et al., 2020; see Box 9.4), and regional and urban floods (Yuan et al., 2018; Tiitmamer, 2020) and droughts (Funk et al., 2018b; Siderius et al., 2018; Uhe et al., 2018) are expected to increase.However, between 2010–2020 more people across Africa have been impacted by floods (e.g., related to Cyclone Idai in March 2019) compared to droughts (Lumbroso, 2020). Coastal cities are vulnerable to floods related to rainfall and sea level rise (Musa et al., 2014), as exemplified by the flood disasters experienced in the Niger delta in 2012 which displaced more than 3 million people and destroyed schools, clinics, markets and electricity installations (Amadi and Ogonor, 2015). From 2000–2015, the proportion of people exposed to floods grew by 20–24%, mostly in Africa and Asia, with Mozambique and multiple countries in West Africa estimated to have had the proportion of their populations exposed to flooding increase by more than 50% (Tellman et al., 2021) and these numbers will increase under climate change. Sectoral impacts from flooding within Africa and globally are further elaborated on in Sections 9.8.2 and 9.8.5.1, Table 9.3 and Chapter 4 Section 4.3.
