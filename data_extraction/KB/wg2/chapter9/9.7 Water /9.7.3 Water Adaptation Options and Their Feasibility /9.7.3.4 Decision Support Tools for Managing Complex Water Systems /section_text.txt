Many studies in Africa use the river basin as a unit of analysis at scale and adopt sophisticated model-based techniques to assess climate change impacts on hydrology under different climate and development scenarios, thereby presenting trade-offs between competing uses such as hydropower generation, irrigation and ecosystem requirements (Section 9.12.1; Yang and Wi, 2018; Ahmed, 2020). However, longer (multi-decadal) hydrological datasets and model improvements are required (Taye et al., 2015), and models should incorporate the quantification of the wider benefits, risks and political opportunities arising from reservoir development to better inform decision makers to achieve a higher level of (transboundary) cooperation (Digna et al., 2016; Nijsten et al., 2018). Collaboration between scientists and policymakers to address the complexity of decision making under uncertainty (Steynor et al., 2016) (Pienaar and Hughes, 2017), coupled with community involvement in participatory scenario development and participatory GIS to aid in collaborative planning that is context specific (Muhati et al., 2018; √Ålvarez Larrain and McCall, 2019) are powerful tools for more beneficial adaptive and resilience-building actions.
