An integrated systems and risk-based approach to the design and management of water resources at scale is generally accepted as a practical and viable way of underpinning the resilience of water systems to climate change and human pressures (Duffy, 2012; Garc√≠a et al., 2014). Such approaches confer multiple benefits to nature and society at scale and enhance efficiency gains through technology and management improvements, but their full implementation has not yet been realised (Weinzierl and Schilling, 2013; McDonald et al., 2014; UN Environment, 2019). Drylands are particularly singled out as ignored areas that require integrated water resource management approaches (Section 9.3.1; Stringer et al., 2021). Appropriate ecosystem-based adaptations that are applicable at scale should be identified and strongly embedded in these approaches to deliver multiple benefits while maintaining the integrity of ecosystems and biodiversity (UN Environment, 2019; see Sections 9.6.4; 9.8.5; Box 4.6). Furthermore, adaptation options are often influenced or constrained by institutions, regulation, availability, distribution, price and technologies (McCarl et al., 2016). Thus, institutional capacity to manage complex water supply systems under rapidly increasing demand and climate change stress is critical in achieving water security for African cities, particularly as cities become more dependent on alternative and distant water sources (Padowski et al., 2016).
