Climate change is projected to increase dependence upon groundwater withdrawals in most parts of Africa as an adaptive strategy to amplified variability in precipitation and surface water resources, highlighting the need for conjunctive surface-groundwater management and rainwater harvesting (Cobbing and Hiller, 2019; Taylor et al., 2019). Alternative water supply options such as desalination, managed aquifer recharge, stormwater harvesting and re-use (direct and indirect, potable and non-potable), all require significant amounts of energy and are complex to operate and maintain. A failure to provide a source of reliable energy and the capacity to implement, maintain and operate these systems is a significant contributor to water scarcity risks in Africa (Muller and Wright, 2016). Soft adaptation options include increasing water use efficiency, changing agricultural practices, more appropriate water pricing (Olmstead, 2014) and enhancing capacity to tackle groundwater overexploitation (Kuper et al., 2016), among others (see Section 9.10.2.4 and Chapter 4 Sections 4.6 and 4.7).
