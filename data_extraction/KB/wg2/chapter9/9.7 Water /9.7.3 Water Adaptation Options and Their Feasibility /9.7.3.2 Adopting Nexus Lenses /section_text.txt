The water–energy–food (WEF) nexus explicitly recognises the strong interdependencies of these three sectors and their high levels of exposure to climate change (Zografos et al., 2014; Dottori et al., 2018; see Box 9.5). With increasing societal demands on more variable water resources under climate change, an intensification of WEF competition and trade-offs are projected (D’Odorico et al., 2018; Dottori et al., 2018). Other interacting factors, for example, the increasing number of transnational investments in land resources can lead to localised increased competition for water resources (Messerli et al., 2014; Breu et al., 2016; Chiarelli et al., 2016). Understanding such nexus interlinkages can help characterise risks to water resource security, identify co-benefits and clarify the range of multi-sectoral actors involved in and affected by development decisions (Kyriakarakos et al., 2020). Major barriers and entry points for greater integration include coordination of horizontal policy and integration of climate change adaptation actions (England et al., 2018), capturing the scarcity values of water and energy embedded in food/energy products (Allan et al., 2015), and inclusion of community-based organisations such as water resource user associations (Villamayor-Tomas et al., 2015) and agricultural cooperatives (Kyriakarakos et al., 2020).
