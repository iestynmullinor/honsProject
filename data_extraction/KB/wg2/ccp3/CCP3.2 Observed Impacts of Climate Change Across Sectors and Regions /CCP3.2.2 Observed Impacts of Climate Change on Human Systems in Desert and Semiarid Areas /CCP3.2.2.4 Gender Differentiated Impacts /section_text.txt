Impacts of desertification, climate change and environmental degradation, as well as vulnerability and capacity to adapt, are gendered. Differences are determined by socially structured gender-specific roles and responsibilities, ownership of, access to and control over natural resources and technology, decision making, and capacity to cope and adapt to long-term changes (Mirzabaev et al., 2019; Cross-Chapter Box GENDER in Chapter 18). Assessments of the gender dimension of desertification and climate change impacts and responses are scarce, and highly context specific. For example, in many lower income countries, rural women produce most of the household food, and are responsible for food preparation and collecting fuelwood and water from increasingly distant sources (Mekonnen et al., 2017; Droy, 2020). Drought and water scarcity particularly affect women and girls in drylands because they need to spend more time and energy collecting water and fuelwood, have less time for education or income-generating activities, and may be more exposed to violence (Sommer et al., 2014) and less able to migrate as an adaptation option. Women are also commonly excluded from family and community decision making on actions to address desertification and climate change, yet their engagement in climate adaptation is critical. International policy efforts are currently seeking to better recognise and address this challenge (Okpara et al., 2019).
