Desertification and SDS can cause substantial socioeconomic damage in drylands (UNEP, 1992; Opp et al., 2021) over both the short and long term. Short-term impacts occur on health, food production systems, infrastructure (damaging buildings, energy systems and communications), transport and related economic productivity, air and road traffic, and costs incurred in clearing sand and dust from deposition areas (Mirzabaev et al., 2019). In the Arab region increasing frequency of SDS events is projected to further exacerbate water scarcity and drought (ESCWA, 2017). Longer-term costs include loss of ecosystem services, biodiversity and habitat, chronic health problems, soil erosion and reduced soil quality (particularly through nutrient losses and deposition of pollutants), and disruption of global climate regulation (Middleton, 2018; Allahbakhshi et al., 2019). Dust deposition nevertheless can offer environmental and economic benefits, bringing important nutrients that improve and sustain soil fertility (Marticorena et al., 2017). Preventing and reducing SDS entails upfront investment costs but full benefitâ€“cost analyses of different measures compared to the costs of inaction are scarce and need to consider the likely frequency and magnitude of SDS events (Tozer and Leys, 2013).
