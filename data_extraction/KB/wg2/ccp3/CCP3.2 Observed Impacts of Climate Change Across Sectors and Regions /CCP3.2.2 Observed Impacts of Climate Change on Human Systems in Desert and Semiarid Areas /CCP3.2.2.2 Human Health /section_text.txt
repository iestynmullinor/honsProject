The potential impacts of climate change, recurrent droughts and desertification on human health in drylands include: higher risks from water scarcity (linked to deteriorating surface and ground water quality and water-borne diseases; Stringer et al., 2021), food insecurity and malnutrition (Section 16.2.3.4) in the absence of sufficient imports, respiratory, cardiovascular and infectious diseases caused by SDS (Mirzabaev et al., 2019), potential displacement and migration and mental health consequences (Chapter 7; Stringer et al., 2021) and heat stress (Dunne et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2015; Russo et al., 2016). SDS negatively impact human health through various pathways, causing respiratory, cardiovascular diseases and facilitating infections (high confidence) (Díaz et al., 2017; Goudarzi et al., 2017; Allahbakhshi et al., 2019; Münzel et al., 2019).  SDS can cause mortality and injuries related to transport accidents (Goudie, 2014). Research from China suggests that prenatal exposure to SDS can affect children’s cognitive function (Li et al., 2018). The pollutants that are entrained and ingested or inhaled closely link to the land management strategies in source areas.Droughts are among the natural hazards with the highest adverse impacts on human populations (Mishra and Singh, 2010; Arias et al., 2021). Although droughts represented just 4% of hazard events, their impacts amounted to 31% of affected people (29 million) (Louvain, 2019). Drought exposure relates to a higher risk of undernutrition (Section 16.5.2.3.6), among vulnerable populations (Kumar, 2016), particularly children (IFPRI, 2016) for whom the impacts can lead to lifelong consequences through stunted growth, impaired cognitive ability and reduced future educational and work performance (UNICEF/WHO/WBG, 2019). The corresponding costs of children stunting in terms of lost economic growth can be of the order of 7% of per capita income in developing countries (Galasso and Wagstaff, 2018).
