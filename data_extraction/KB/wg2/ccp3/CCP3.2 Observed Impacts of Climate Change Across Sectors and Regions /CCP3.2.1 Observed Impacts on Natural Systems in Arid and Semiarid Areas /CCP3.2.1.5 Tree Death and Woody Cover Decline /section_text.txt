Field measurements have also detected tree mortality and loss of mesic tree species at some Sahel sites during drought periods (Gonzalez et al., 2012; Kusserow, 2017; Brandt et al., 2018; Ibrahim et al., 2018; Trichon et al., 2018; Zwarts et al., 2018; Bernardino et al., 2020; Zida et al., 2020) and a reduction of mesic species in favour of drought-tolerant species (high confidence) (Hänke et al., 2016; Kusserow, 2017; Ibrahim et al., 2018; Trichon et al., 2018; Dendoncker et al., 2020; Zida et al., 2020b), with attribution to climate change (Gonzalez et al., 2012). Furthermore, vegetation productivity per unit of rainfall showed a net decline of 4% in the period 2000–2015 across drylands globally, with the greatest net declines in Africa (16%) and Asia (33%) (Abel et al., 2021), but with location-specific increases in vegetation-rainfall sensitivity, for example, in southern and eastern Africa and parts of the Sahel. Furthermore, NDVI declines were reported across the Sahel from 1999 to 2015 (Yuan et al., 2019; Zida et al., 2020a). However, field site monitoring showed a strong regeneration of the decimated woody populations except on shallow soil where the runoff system had evolved towards a web of gullies (Hiernaux et al., 2009a; Trichon et al., 2018; Wendling et al., 2019) .Other site-specific impacts include tree mortality in southwestern Morocco (Le Polain de Waroux and Lambin, 2012), mortality of Austrocedrus and Nothofagus forests in the dry Patagonia forest-steppe (Rodríguez-Catón et al., 2019) and a tree range contraction of Aloidendron dichotmum in southern Africa (Foden et al., 2007b). In Morocco, tree mortality was most highly correlated to an increase in aridity, measured by the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which showed a statistically significant increase since 1900 due to climate change (Dai et al., 2004; Esper et al., 2007; Dai, 2011).In deserts of the southwestern USA, a drought since 2000, mainly due to climate change (Williams et al., 2020), together with land use change, invasive plant species and wildfire (Syphard et al., 2017), has led to reductions in native desert plant species (Defalco et al., 2010; Conver et al., 2017) and perennial vegetation cover (Munson et al., 2016a; 2016b). An increase in invasive exotic grasses has increased wildfires in these desert ecosystems in which fire had been rare (Brooks and Matchett, 2006; Abatzoglou and Kolden, 2011; Hegeman et al., 2014; Horn and St. Clair, 2017). In the Mojave Desert in the USA, a loss of bird biodiversity has also been detected and attributed to increased aridity caused by climate change (Iknayan and Beissinger, 2018; Riddell et al., 2019).
