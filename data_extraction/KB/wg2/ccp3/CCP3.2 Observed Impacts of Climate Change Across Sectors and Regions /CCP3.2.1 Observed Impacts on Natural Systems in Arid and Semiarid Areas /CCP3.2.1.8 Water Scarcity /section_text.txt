Climate change and desertification have been linked to water loss (Bayram and Öztürk, 2014; Schwilch et al., 2014; Mohamed et al., 2016), decreases in water quantity for irrigation and contamination of surface water bodies (Middleton, 2017). Increased runoff in areas in the Sahel with shallow soils increased water flows to lakes and the recharge of water tables (Favreau et al., 2009; Gardelle et al., 2010; Descroix et al., 2013; Kaptué et al., 2015; Gal et al., 2017). Water scarcity (Section 16.5.2.3.7) was among the first impacts of climate change recognised in North African countries such as Morocco which have extensive dryland areas, with countries such as Turkey, Libya, USA and China carrying out large-scale water transfer projects (Sternberg, 2016; Stringer et al., 2021). The decrease in water availability in Morocco was substantial in terms of both surface water supply (Rochdane et al., 2012; Choukri et al., 2020) and groundwater (Bahir et al., 2020), threatening agricultural production.
