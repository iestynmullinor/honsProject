Dryland ecosystems have shown mixed trends of decreases and increases in vegetation and biodiversity, depending on the time period, geographic region and vegetation type assessed (see Table CCP3.1 for examples of observed environmental changes and impacts in drylands and the role of climate change and non-climatic factors in causing these changes).Increases in shrub cover in arid deserts and shrublands have been recorded in the North American drylands (Caracciolo et al., 2016; Archer et al., 2017; Chambers et al., 2019), the Namib desert (Rohde et al., 2019), the Karoo (Ward et al., 2014; Masubelele et al., 2015b), north and central Mexico (Pérez-Sánchez et al., 2011; Báez et al., 2013; Castillón et al., 2015; Sosa et al., 2019), large parts of the West African Sahel with some local exceptions (Brandt et al., 2016) and Central Asia (Jia et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2016; Jiao et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). Increasing woodiness in the Namib is consistent with an increase in rainfall extremes and westward expansion of convective rainfall (Haensler et al., 2010; Rohde et al., 2019). Increasing rainfall and rising CO2 concentrations (which improves water use efficiency) benefits some shrubs (Polley et al., 1997; Morgan et al., 2004; Donohue et al., 2013). Together with changes in land use (Hoffman et al., 2018), improved land management (Reij et al., 2005) and improved irrigation (He et al., 2019), this contributes to woody cover increases. Extensive woody encroachment has been recorded in savannas (measured between 1920–2015, over the past century) in Africa (2.4% woody cover increase per decade), Australia (1% increase per decade), and South America (8% increase per decade) (O’Connor et al., 2014; Stevens et al., 2016; Skowno et al., 2017; Venter et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019). Following drought in the Sahel (1968–1973 and 1982–1984), a rainfall increase since the mid-1990s has been linked to increases of woody cover between 1992–2011/2012 (Brandt et al., 2016; Brandt et al., 2017; Brandt et al., 2019). See SRCCL Section 3.2.1.1 for an evaluation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and remote sensing approaches used in these studies. Tree regeneration by farmers has also increased woody cover, particularly next to villages (high confidence) (Reij et al., 2005; Reij and Garrity, 2016; Brandt et al., 2018). Otherwise, savanna encroachment has been attributed to combinations of increased rainfall (Venter et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019), warming (Venter et al., 2018) and CO2 fertilization (Kgope et al., 2010; Bond and Midgley, 2012; Buitenwerf et al., 2012; Stevens et al., 2016; Quirk et al., 2019) interacting with changing land use (Archer et al., 2017; Venter et al., 2018), where herbivory and fire regimes are altered (O’Connor et al., 2014; Archer et al., 2017; see also discussion on fire and herbivory in Section 2.4.3.1). In some cases, woody increase has been balanced locally by changes in runoff (Trichon et al., 2018) or by land clearing and fuel wood harvesting, as seen in western Niger, northern Nigeria, and at the periphery of major towns (Montagné et al., 2016).Table CCP3.1 | Observed ecological changes in drylands.RegionObserved changeClimate change factorsAttribution to climate changeNon-climate change factorsConfidence in observed changeReferencesHyper-aridAsian hyper-arid regions (Gobi)Loss of shallow rooted desert plantsIncrease in extreme warm temperaturesmediumLi et al.
