Pastoralism is a livestock-keeping system based on the herding of animals. Migrations often take place over long distances to track variable and unpredictable plant growth that tends to be patchy in space and variable in time (Homewood, 2018). Pastoralism has a considerably lower carbon budget than other livestock-keeping systems. Research on pastoralism in the Sahel concluded that this system may be carbon neutral (Assouma et al., 2019), despite contributing directly to greenhouse gas emissions via methane enteric emissions and indirectly through faeces-driven CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions during mineralisation (Assouma et al., 2017). Efforts to sedentarise and settle pastoralists in villages can lead to land degradation and higher overall emissions from the sector.Pastoralists migrate with their animals in some of the most remote and marginal environments on the planet. Globally, mobile pastoralists number about 200 million households and use about 25% of the Earth’s landmass (Dong, 2016). Many pastoralists operate in non-equilibrial environments that are unstable, fluctuating and generally uncertain, and are driven more by climatic variation than livestock numbers and grazing pressure (Behnke et al., 1993). Examples of such systems are grazing areas in the dry tropics (Sandford, 1983; Turner, 1993; Sullivan and Rohde, 2002; Benjaminsen et al., 2006; Hiernaux et al., 2016) and rangelands in the Arctic (Behnke, 2000; Tyler et al., 2008; Benjaminsen et al., 2015; Marin et al., 2020).Over many generations, pastoralists have accumulated practical experience and knowledge to cope with uncertainty and value variability (Krätli and Schareika, 2010), mainly through a mobile and flexible approach. While pastoralists are also at risk of climate change impacts, they may be better able to adapt to a changing climate than other land users (Davies and Nori, 2008; Krätli and Schareika, 2010; Jones and Gutzler, 2016).While pastoralists possess substantial adaptive capacity as a result of their Indigenous knowledge, this has been under pressure during the last few decades through continued loss of livestock corridors (essential to mobility) and pastures in general due to competing land uses, such as farming, mining, crop expansion and the establishment or extension of protected areas (Thébaud and Batterbury, 2001; Brockington, 2002; Benjaminsen and Ba, 2009; Upton, 2014; Johnsen, 2016; Tappan, 2016; Homewood, 2018; Weldemichel and Lein, 2019; Bergius et al., 2020). Many of these competing land uses erect fences and exclude other uses, while property rights often privilege sedentary farming.Modern states have typically tried to settle pastoralists and confine their movements within clearly defined boundaries, claiming that pastoral land use is neither ecologically sustainable nor economically productive. Based on such negative and often flawed views, stall-feeding and ranching are often presented by policymakers as successful models of livestock keeping in contrast to the pastoral way of life (Steinfeld et al., 2006; Chatty, 2007).Current pressures and processes of pastoral change are spatially variable and complex, and tend to result in further economic and political marginalisation of pastoralists, with adverse effects on livelihoods and landscapes. With climate change, which is projected to lead to higher temperatures and more frequent fluctuations in precipitation, maintaining flexibility and resilience in pastoral land use is essential. However, current processes of marginalisation, in addition to increased insecurity in some drylands (e.g., the Sahel), make pastoralists more vulnerable, and constrain them from fully employing their adaptive capacities (Davies and Nori, 2008). The skills and capacities held by pastoralists may, however, offer lessons for society at large in its struggle to adapt to climate change and deal with increased uncertainty (Davies and Nori, 2008; Scoones, 2009; Nori and Scoones, 2019).
