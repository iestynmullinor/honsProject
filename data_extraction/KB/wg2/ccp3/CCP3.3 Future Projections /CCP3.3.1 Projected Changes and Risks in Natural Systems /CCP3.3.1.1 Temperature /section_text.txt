Globally, warming rates have been twice as high in drylands as in humid lands, because the sparse vegetation cover and lower soil moisture of dryland ecosystems amplify temperature and aridity increases (Huang et al., 2016). This enhanced warming is expected to continue in the future. Surface warming over drylands is projected to reach ~6.5°C (~3.5°C) under the high Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 (low-moderate RCP4.5) emissions scenario by the end of this century, relative to the historical period (1961–1990) (Huang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017). Exploring the spatial variations between the aeolian desertification response in selected climate change scenarios, Wang et al. (2017) reported that temperature rise could trigger aeolian desertification in West Asia, Central China and Mongolia. The number of extremely hot days with temperatures above 40°C is projected to increase considerably across the Arab region by the end of the 21st century (ESCWA, 2017).
