Drivers of desert expansion and greening are numerous, are attributed to environmental and human processes and differ across dryland types, yet a suite of adaptations can help to address human drivers of change, support resilience and build the adaptive capacity of dryland people (medium confidence). Deserts and semiarid areas have a rich cultural heritage, and Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge (IKLK) which enrich and influence sustainability and land use globally. Growing research evidence and experience highlight the necessary features of an enabling environment for dryland adaptation (Section 8.5.2). Key enablers include supportive policies, institutions and governance approaches that strengthen the adaptive capacities of dryland farmers, pastoralists and other dryland resource users (high confidence), addressing drivers (proximate and underlying) as well as symptoms of desertification. For instance, the skills and capacities held by the mobile and adaptive approach of pastoralists may provide lessons for society at large in adapting to climate change and dealing with increased uncertainty. Such a policy would stand in contrast to previous attempts at settling pastoralists. There is a persistent gap in terms of scaling-up already known good practices, combining nature-based, land-based and ecosystem-based approaches that facilitate sustainable land management, with contextually appropriate and responsible governance systems (e.g., including those supporting communal land tenure arrangements and IKLK; medium confidence). Land-based adaptations can help manage dryland changes, including sand and dust storms and desertification (high confidence), while technological options linked to water management draw from both traditional practices and new innovations. Adequate financing and investment is required to harness multiple benefits for managing the impacts of climate change and desertification while accelerating progress towards sustainable development in deserts and semiarid areas. {3.4}
