A significant number of studies address the impacts of climate change on the Amazon rainforest (Brienen et al., 2015; Doughty et al., 2015; Feldpausch et al., 2016; Rammig, 2020; Sullivan et al., 2020); however, assessment of the tangible and intangible impacts of climate change on Indigenous Peoples’ cultures and livelihoods in this forest need to be further advanced (Brondízio et al., 2016; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018).Studies on the perception of climate change in rural and urban populations throughout the region have increased, but there is a lack of more specific research on the perception of specific groups, such as economic or political actors, that influence public institutions and policies at the local, regional and national levels.While studies on climate-change gender-differentiated impacts have grown over the past 10 years in CSA, studies on how gender intersects with other dimensions such as race, ethnicity, age or rural/urban setting are still needed. This will help to further understand how gender inequalities are connected to broader power structures in society and, thus, to produce evidence on the importance of an intersectional approach to climate change.Regarding the relation of social movements and climate-change adaptation, institutions and politics, two major issues stand out: youth movements for climate change and the resistances, mainly urban, to climate-change adaptation policies. Little connection is found in research concentrating on resistance to climate-change adaptation policies and their interaction with the politics of place. Conflictivity related to climate change is another understudied issue.Although there are several case studies on migrations and displacements caused by strong and immediate climatic threats, such as hurricanes or floods, and on slow-onset impacts, such as droughts or temperature increase, there are gaps in the attribution or relative weight of climate change in these processes.Still important to note is that synergies between mitigation, adaptation, risk reduction and sustainable development have not been jointly explored, which would better facilitate adaptation policy approaches.There are critical knowledge gaps in the interlinkages between social and environmental dynamics that are important for climate-change adaptation, as in Andean forest landscapes. A salient knowledge gap in this thematic area is the need to characterise how multi-level and multi-actor governance systems can enable sustainable land management practices, including ecosystem restoration (Mathez-Stiefel et al., 2017). More capacities are needed to increase the generation of relevant knowledge. Even small grant programmes can sustain research projects that target the linkages between knowledge and decision-making at multiple scales (Báez et al., 2020).
