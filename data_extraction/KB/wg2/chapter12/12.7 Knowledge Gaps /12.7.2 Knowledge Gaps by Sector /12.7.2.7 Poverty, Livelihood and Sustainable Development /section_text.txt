Climate change is becoming a major obstacle to poverty reduction and overcoming poverty traps. There is a need to better understand how poor and vulnerable communities are affected and the more effective ways to prevent it. The large majority of the poor in the region are living in urban areas (UNDESA, 2019); extreme urban poverty is increasingly more relevant, including the needs and priorities of informal settlements and economies, but less studied within the interaction with climate change. There is little reporting of major adaptation options implemented by or for vulnerable and poor urban dwellers (Ryan and Bustos, 2019; Berrang-Ford et al., 2021).Adaptation options are being increasingly documented for poverty-related impacts, despite the fact that the uncertain context from climate impacts is not uniform across communities and the very local scale of the type of adaptation responses needed (Miranda Sara et al., 2016; Rosenzweig et al., 2018; Dodman et al., 2019). There is a huge gap in understanding how the poor respond to climate change, what is needed to support them and the interconnections among development policies, poverty and risk reduction with climate-change actions (Ryan and Bustos, 2019; Satterthwaite et al., 2020).The literature to assess the effectiveness of pro-poor or low-income adaptation options continues to be weak; a very small proportion shows results associated with adaptation efforts (Magrin et al., 2014; Berrang-Ford et al., 2021). Without this kind of approach and in-depth understanding there is the risk that top-down climate-change adaptation options could reinforce poverty cycles and neglect cultural values, even eroding them (Bartlett and Satterthwaite, 2016; Walshe and Argumedo, 2016; Allen et al., 2017a; Hallegatte et al., 2018; Kalikoski et al., 2018; UN-Habitat, 2018).The impacts of climate change on vulnerable groups remain understudied. There are little or no climate data on the remote mountain regions of CSA as well as research measuring the vulnerability of smallholders living there, making it hard to assess the expected changes or the possible adaptation measures (Pons et al., 2016; Donatti et al., 2019).
