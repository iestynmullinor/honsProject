As in other sectors and environmental systems, for the water sector there are important limitations in terms of monitoring and data collection. High-quality, long-term hydrological data are unevenly available for different sub-regions and limit the possibility of obtaining a deeper understanding of changes in river runoff and lake or groundwater changes. Groundwater data are particularly scarce. There are important gaps related to the projections of water resources for the future. Much of current knowledge on future changes in water resources and water scarcity and flood risks is based on information from global-scale studies because studies specific to this region are scarce. Several elements that are important for IWRM, such as water quality, water demand, privatisation and other economic dynamics, and nutrient, pollutant and sediment flux are poorly known currently due to missing data and insufficient efforts to monitor them.
