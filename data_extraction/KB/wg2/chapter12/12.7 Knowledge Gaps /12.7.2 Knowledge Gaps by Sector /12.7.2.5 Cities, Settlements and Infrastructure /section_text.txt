Despite the high level of urbanisation in the region, studies on urban adaptation initiatives are still underreported by municipalities, and several practical results have not yet been demonstrated (Araos et al., 2016). This issue is particularly relevant to medium-sized cities because most of the literature and data available on adaptation refer to the major capital cities. The potential of applying new resilient parameters in building and land use regulations for adaptation is underreported. The same can be said about the impact of housing improvement and slum upgrading on climate resilience, even when initiatives are focused on reducing environmental and climate risk. Also relevant in the region is a gap in research about NbS applied to urban area adaptation, as in the case of the urban forestry potential for adaptation (Barona et al., 2020). Even though the importance of urban ecological infrastructure in providing ecosystem services, such as flood control, is reasonably well documented, its practical application in urban planning in CSA remains limited (Romero-Duque et al., 2020). Added to this is the lack of monitoring data on adaptation initiatives in general and, in particular, on adaptation initiatives in water systems that have already been implemented and their effects on risk reduction. A lack of monitoring data contributes to the lack of information about maladaptation in urban areas and its consequences. Mobility and transport system adaptation options remained virtually entirely unexplored, while mitigation options receive significant attention.
