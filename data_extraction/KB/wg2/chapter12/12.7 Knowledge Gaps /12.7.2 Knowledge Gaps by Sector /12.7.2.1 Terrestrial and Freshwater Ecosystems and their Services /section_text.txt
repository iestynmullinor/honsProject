Advances in scientific knowledge on the risks of climate-change impacts and the vulnerability and resilience of ecosystems to climate change are needed (Bustamante et al., 2020). Persistent climate change in tropical rainforests requires deeper study and understanding, overall in connection with the role of nutrients, deep-water availability and biodiversity. Further research is needed to understand feedback to climate systems of large-scale changes in the land surface in SA biomes. The region has important freshwater Global 200 Ecoregions, including the Orinoco River and Flooded Forests, Upper Amazon River and streams, and Amazon River and Flooded Forests, which represent a priority for freshwater biodiversity conservation at a global scale (Manes et al., 2021) (Cross-Chapter Paper 1; Figure 12.8). There is, however, a clear knowledge gap on the impacts of climate change on freshwater biodiversity in the region (Section CCP1.2.3; Manes et al., 2021). Lastly, more interdisciplinary research is needed regarding conservation strategies and stable financial resources focusing on adaptation of ecosystems in the region (Mistry et al., 2016; Gebara and Agrawal, 2017; Ruggiero et al., 2019; To and Dressler, 2019).
