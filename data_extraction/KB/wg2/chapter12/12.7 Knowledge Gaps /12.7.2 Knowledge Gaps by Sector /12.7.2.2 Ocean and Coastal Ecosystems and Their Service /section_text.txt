There is an important lack of knowledge about the state of health of the ocean and coastal ecosystems along CSA (i.e., social-ecological data integration, poor sampling efforts, lack of information about the value of ecosystem services, lack of information about ecosystems cover and distribution, lack of studies about climate-change perceptions and social concerns), including marine fisheries (i.e., landing statistics not available, lack of reliable information on the scope of resource extraction, among others). Poor or absent monitoring programmes (physical, environmental and biological variables) that feed alert and surveillance systems are lacking in CSA. There is a general absence of a continuous line of scientific research or adequate baseline information about the impacts of climate change, as well as continuous monitoring of the adaptation plans adopted in ocean and coastal ecosystems that limit the formulation of adequate conservation and management programmes. When studies are performed, inadequate access to data limits the analyses of the existing information, making difficult to detect climate-change trends and impacts and develop effective adaptation strategies.
