Integrative evaluation on impacts on food security, including agricultural production, distribution and access, leading to adaptation strategies is limited within the region. Limited information regarding cost-benefit analyses of adaptation in the food production sector is available in the region. It is also important to obtain a better understanding of adaptation effects to avoid maladaptation and promote site-specific and dynamic adaptation options considering available technologies. Compiling and systematising existing scientific and local knowledge on the relationship between forests, land cover/use and hydrological services is a gap that must be filled from a broader perspective in the region, which could contribute to formulating recommendations and inform restoration practices and policies. The literature also highlights widespread gaps between farmersâ€™ information needs and services that are routinely available. There is evidence that when climate information services are created with farmer input and targeted in a timely and inclusive manner, they are a positive determinant of adaptation through the adoption of more resilient farm-level practices. However, current assessments of the economic impacts of climate information services are scarce; hence, more such studies are needed.
