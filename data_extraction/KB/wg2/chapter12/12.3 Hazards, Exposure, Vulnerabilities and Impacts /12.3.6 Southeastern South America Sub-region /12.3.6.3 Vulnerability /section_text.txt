The River Plate basin and the city of Buenos Aires are highly vulnerable to recurring floods, and the increasing number of newcomers to the area reduce the collective cultural adaptation developed by older neighbours (high confidence) (Barros, 2006; Nagy et al., 2019; Mettler-Grove, 2020; Morales-Yokobori, 2021; Oyedotun and Ally, 2021). Extreme events, including storm surges and coastal inundation/flooding, cause injuries and economic/environmental losses on the urbanised coastline of Southern Brazil (States of São Paulo and Santa Catarina) (high confidence) (Muehe, 2010; Khalid et al., 2020; Ohz et al., 2020; de Souza and Ramos da Silva, 2021; Quadrado et al., 2021; Silva de Souza et al., 2021).Cities like Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo are overpopulated, where most people live in poor conditions of inadequate housing and sanitation, such as slums, with little and no trees and high temperatures. These people have low access to sanitation, public health and residential cooling and are vulnerable to the effects of heat islands on human comfort and health (Figure 12.7). These include cardiopulmonary, vector-borne diseases and even death (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Araujo et al., 2015; Mishra et al., 2015; Geirinhas et al., 2018; Peres et al., 2018). Heat stress is known to worsen cardiovascular, diabetic and respiratory conditions (Lapola et al., 2019a). In connection with the heat island effect, these people are also vulnerable to injuries and casualties due to increased thunderstorms, causing economic losses and other social problems (Vemado and Pereira Filho, 2016).
