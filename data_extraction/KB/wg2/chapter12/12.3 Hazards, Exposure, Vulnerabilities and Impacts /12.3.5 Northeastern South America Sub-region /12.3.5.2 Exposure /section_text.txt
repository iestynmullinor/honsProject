NES is home to about 60 million people (estimate for 2019 fromIBGE [2020]]), with >70% living in urban areas (data for 2010 from IBGE [2020]; Silva et al. [2017]) and high poverty levels (>50%, data for 2003 fromIBGE [2020]]). People are exposed to intense drought and famine (high confidence), and about 94% of the region has moderate to high susceptibility to desertification (Marengo and Bernasconi, 2015; Spinoni et al., 2015; Vieira et al., 2015; Mariano et al., 2018; Tomasella et al., 2018; Marengo et al., 2020c). The most severe dry spell of 2012–2013 affected about 9 million people, who were exposed to water, food and energy scarcity (Marengo and Bernasconi, 2015).People, infrastructure and economic activities are exposed to SLR in the 3800 km of coastline (medium confidence). The high concentration of cities on the coast is a concern (Martins et al., 2017), with all state capital cities but one on the coast, totalling almost 12 million vulnerable people (estimate for 2019 fromIBGE [2020]]). The ports of São Luís, Recife and Salvador are important exporters of Brazilian commodities, and the beaches in the sub-region are an international touristic destination, generating considerable revenues (Pegas et al., 2015; Ribeiro et al., 2017).Natural systems in NES are also exposed to climate change. In terrestrial ecosystems, 913,000 km 2 of NES’ dry forest Caatinga vegetation (Silva et al., 2017) is exposed to predicted increases in dryness. Despite what has been previously suggested, the Caatinga has high biodiversity and endemism (Silva et al., 2017), which vulnerable to habitat reduction due to climate change and agricultural expansion (Silva et al., 2019b). Fifty-two percent of the freshwater fish (203 species) are endemic (Lima et al., 2017) and are exposed to predicted reduction in river flow due to climate change (Marengo et al., 2017; de Jong et al., 2018). The coastal waters contain a separate marine ecoregion due to its uniqueness (Spalding et al., 2007). The region is responsible for 99% of Brazilian shrimp production, which is exposed to SLR and increases in ocean temperature and acidification (Gasalla et al., 2017). Most coral reefs in the Southern Atlantic Ocean are along NES’s coast (Leão et al., 2016), increasing its conservation and touristic value. The 685 km 2 of coral reefs along NES’s coast (likely an underestimate [Moura et al. 2013; UNEP-WCMC et al. 2018]) are exposed to increased sea temperatures.
