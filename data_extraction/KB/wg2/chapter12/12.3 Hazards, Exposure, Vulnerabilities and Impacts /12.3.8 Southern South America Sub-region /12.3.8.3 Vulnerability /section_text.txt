There are reports related to a decrease in survival, growth and higher vulnerability to drought and fire severity for species of native forests due to climate change and wildfires (high confidence) (Mundo et al., 2010; Landesmann et al., 2015; Whitlock et al., 2015; Jump et al., 2017; Camarero et al., 2018; Venegas-González et al., 2018a). A coincidence has been reported between major changes in regional decline in the growth of forests with severe droughts due to climatic variations over northern Patagonia (Rodríguez-Catón et al., 2016). Once the forest decline begins, other contributing factors, such as insects (e.g., defoliator outbreaks), increase forest vulnerability or accelerate the loss of forest health of previously stressed trees (Piper et al., 2015). This region hosts unique temperate rainforests, which are particularly rich in endemic and long-lived conifer species (e.g., Fitzroya cupressoides) and which may be vulnerable to declines in soil moisture availability (Camarero and Fajardo, 2017). Patagonia will probably be vulnerable to a decrease in precipitation regimes due to climate change, and consequently many species that rely on meadows in an arid environment will also be impacted (Crego et al., 2014). The floods triggered by strong ENSOs caused significant changes in crop production (Isla et al., 2018).The development of various human activities and water infrastructure is depleting water sources, changing river basins from exoreic to endoreic and the disappearance of a lake in 2016 (Scordo et al., 2017). Numerous dams for irrigation, some of which are also used for hydropower, have been and are planned to be built despite wind power generation potential (Silva, 2016). Oil and gas have played an important role in the rise of Neuquén-Cipolletti as Patagonia’s most populous urban area and in the growth of Comodoro Rivadavia, Punta Arenas and Rio Grande as well.
