There were inconsistent trends and insufficient data coverage on extreme temperatures and precipitation (low confidence), but an increase in the frequency of meteorological droughts was observed with medium confidence (Dereczynski et al., 2020; Dunn et al., 2020; WGI AR6 Tables 11.13, 11.14, 11.15, Seneviratne et al., 2021; WGI AR6 Table 12.3, Ranasinghe et al., 2021). An increase in precipitation in Trelew, no change for Comodoro Rivadavia, both stations located in eastern Patagonia, and negative trends in austral summer rainfall in the southern Andes were observed (Vera and Díaz, 2015; Saurral et al., 2017). Chile’s wildfires in Patagonia (fire frequency and intensity) have grown at an alarming rate (Úbeda and Sarricolea, 2016). Decreasing rainfall patterns in Punta Arenas is closely associated with variability at interannual to inter-decadal time scales of the main forcing system of climate in Patagonia. Snow cover extension (SCE) and snow cover duration decreased by an average of approximately 13 ± 2% and 43 ± 20 d respectively from 2000 to 2016, due to warming rather than drying (Rasmussen et al., 2007). In particular, analysis of spatial patterns of SCE indicates a slightly greater reduction on the eastern side (approximately 14 ± 2%) of the Andes Cordillera compared to the western side (approximately 12 ± 3%). According to the longest time series of glacier mass balance data in the Southern Hemisphere, the Echaurren Norte glacier lost 65% of its original area in the period 1955–2015 and disaggregated into two ice bodies in the late 1990s (Malmros et al., 2018; Pérez et al., 2018).Mean temperatures in the SSA sub-region are projected to continue to rise up to +2.5°C by 2080 with respect to the present climate (Kreps et al., 2012). A rise in temperature means that an isotherm of 0°C will move up mountains, leaving less surface for accumulation of snow (Barros et al., 2015).An increase in the intensity and frequency of hot extremes and a decrease in the intensity and frequency of cold extremes are projected to be likely  (WGI AR6 Table 11.13, Seneviratne et al., 2021); CMIP6 models project an increase in the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation (medium confidence). It is expected that an increase in the intensity of heavy precipitation, droughts and fire weather will intensify through the 21st  century in SSA, but mean wind will decrease (medium confidence) (Kitoh et al., 2011; WGI AR6 Tables 11.14 and Table 11.15, Seneviratne et al., 2021). The probability of extended droughts, such as the recently experienced mega-drought (2010–2015), increases to up to 5 events/100 yr (Bozkurt et al., 2017). Snow, glaciers, permafrost and ice sheets will decrease with high confidence (WGI AR6 Table 12.6, Ranasinghe et al., 2021). The observed area and the elevation changes indicate that the Echaurren Norte glacier may disappear in the coming years if negative mass balance rates prevail (medium confidence) (Farías-Barahona et al., 2019).
