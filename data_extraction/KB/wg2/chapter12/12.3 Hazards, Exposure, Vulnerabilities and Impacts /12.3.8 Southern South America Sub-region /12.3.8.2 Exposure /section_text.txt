Grasslands make a significant contribution to food security in Patagonia by providing part of the feed requirements of ruminants used for meat, wool and milk production. There is a lack of information regarding the combined effects of climate change and overgrazing and the consequences for pastoral livelihoods that depend on rangelands. Temperature and the amount and seasonal distribution of precipitation were important controls of vegetation structure in Patagonian rangelands (Gaitán et al., 2014). They found that over two-thirds of the total effect of precipitation on above-ground net primary production (ANPP) was direct, and the other third was indirect (via the effects of precipitation on vegetation structure). Thus, if evapotranspiration and drought stress increase as temperature increases and rainfall decreases in water-limited ecosystems, a greater exposure of ranchers to a reduction in stocking rate and, therefore, family income would be expected (medium confidence). The number of farmers (mainly family enterprises) exposed to climatic hazards (drought) is approximately 70,000–80,000, who have 14–15 million sheep in Argentina (Peri et al., 2021).The main Argentinian Patagonia cities have developed as a result of oil and gas extraction, which requires massive quantities of water due to fracking and drilling techniques. Vaca Muerta is the major region in SA, where those techniques are used to extract oil and gas, and this will lead to an exacerbation of current water scarcity issues and to competition with irrigated agriculture (Rosa and D’Odorico, 2019), which in the context of drought may exacerbate socioenvironmental conflicts (medium confidence).
