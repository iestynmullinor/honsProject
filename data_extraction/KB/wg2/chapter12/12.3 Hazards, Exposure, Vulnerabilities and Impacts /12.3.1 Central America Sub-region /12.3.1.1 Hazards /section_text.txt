Since the mid-20th century, extreme warm temperatures have increased and extreme cold temperatures have decreased in the region (medium confidence). The magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation events have increased, but droughts have mixed signals (low confidence) (WGI AR6 Table 11.13, Table 11.14, Table 11.15, Seneviratne et al., 2021). Spatially variable trends have been detected for the MSD timing, the amount of rainy-season precipitation, the number of consecutive and total dry days and extreme wet events at the local scale since the 1980s. At the regional scale, a positive trend in the duration, but not the magnitude, of the MSD was found (Anderson et al., 2019).Significant increases in tropical cyclone (TC) intensification rates in the Atlantic basin, highly unusual compared to model-based estimates of internal climate variations, have been observed (Bhatia et al., 2019). TCs contributed approximately 10% of the annual precipitation (Khouakhi et al., 2017). During the TC season more TC-driven events of extreme sea level exceed a 10-year return period (Muis et al., 2019).Massive heatwave events and increase in the frequency of warm extremes are projected at the end of the 21st  century (high confidence). When comparing 2.0°C with 1.5°C of warming, the longest annual warm wave is projected to increase more than 60 d (Taylor et al., 2018).General decrease in the magnitude of heavy precipitation extremes (Chou et al., 2014; Giorgi et al., 2014) (in 1.5°C projection) but increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation (R50mm) (Imbach et al., 2018) are projected for both 2°C and 4°C global warming level (GWL). Strong declines in mean daily rainfall are projected for July in Belize (Stennett-Brown et al., 2017; WGI AR6 Table 11.14, Seneviratne et al., 2021) and decreased rainfall through the year for all capital cities except Panama City (medium confidence: limited evidence, high agreement ) (Pinzón et al., 2017).The main climate impact drivers like extreme heat, drought, relative SLR, coastal flooding, erosion, marine heatwaves, ocean aridity (high confidence) and aridity, drought and wildfires will increase by mid-century (medium confidence) (Figure 12.6, WGI AR6 Table 12.6, Ranasinghe et al., 2021).The rainy season in CA will likely experience more pronounced MSD by the end of this century, with a signal for reduced minimum precipitation by mid-century for the June July August (JJA) and September October November (SON) quarters, and a broader second peak is projected, consistent with the future south displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) (high confidence) (Fuentes-Franco et al., 2015; Hidalgo et al., 2017; Maurer et al., 2017; Imbach et al., 2018; Naumann et al., 2018; Ribalaygua et al., 2018; Corrales-Suastegui et al., 2020).Climate projections indicate a decrease in frequency of TCs in CA accompanied by an increased frequency of intense cyclones (WGI AR6 Section 12.4.4.3, Ranasinghe et al., 2021).
