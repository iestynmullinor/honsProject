Of the 47 million Central Americans in 2015, 40% lived in rural areas, with Belize being the least urbanised (54% rural) and Costa Rica the most (21% rural) (CELADE, 2019); 10.5 million lived in the Dry Corridor region, an area recently exposed to severe droughts that have resulted in 3.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance (FAO, 2016a). Except in Belize and Panama, the majority of the countries’ populations—ranging from 56% in Honduras to 95% in El Salvador—were exposed to two or more risks derived from natural extreme events, affecting between 57% and 96% of the GDP of the countries (UNISDR and CEPREDENAC, 2014). CA is one of the regions most exposed to climatic phenomena; with long coastlines and lowland areas, the region is repeatedly affected by drought, intense rains, cyclones and ENSO events (high confidence) (ECLAC et al., 2015).Large urban centres are located on mountains or away from the shore, with the notable exceptions of Panama City, Belmopan and Managua, capital cities housing around 3 million people. Urban development in the capital cities and suburbs has almost tripled in the last 40 years, reaching population densities as high as 11,000 inhabitants/km 2 in Guatemala City and Tegucigalpa, with the spread of poor neighbourhoods in steep ravines and other marginal high-risk areas (Programa Estado de la Nación – Estado de la Región, 2016).
