There is high confidence that coastal lowlands are exposed to SLR in the form of coastal flooding and erosion, subsidence and saltwater intrusion (Hoyos et al., 2013). Those hazards can affect settlements, ports, industries and other infrastructures. Mangrove and aquaculture areas are among the most exposed systems (Gorman, 2018). The Eastern Tropical Pacific, particularly Sector Niño 3.4, will see the worst increase in SST, affecting industrial and small-scale fisheries (very high confidence) (Castrejón and Defeo, 2015; Reguero et al., 2015; Eddy et al., 2019; Bertrand et al., 2020; Castrejón and Charles, 2020; Escobar-Camacho et al., 2021).Settlements and agriculture on different scales and hydroelectric infrastructures, especially near big rivers or in plains, are exposed to floods. Exposure and vulnerabilities to precipitation, overflows and related landslides are increasing (Briones-Estébanez and Ebecken, 2017).The Andean piedmont (500–1200 metres above sea level [MASL]) ecosystems and crops and elevation ranges above the treeline are more exposed to thermal anomalies (very high confidence) (Urrutia and Vuille, 2009; Vuille et al., 2015; Aguilar-Lome et al., 2019; Pabón-Caicedo et al., 2020). Temperature rise, combined with precipitation and floods, leaves people more exposed to epidemics (very high confidence) (Stewart-Ibarra and Lowe, 2013; Sippy et al., 2019; Petrova et al., 2020). A more significant exposure is related to lower socioeconomic conditions, poor health and marginalisation (Oliver-Smith, 2014).
