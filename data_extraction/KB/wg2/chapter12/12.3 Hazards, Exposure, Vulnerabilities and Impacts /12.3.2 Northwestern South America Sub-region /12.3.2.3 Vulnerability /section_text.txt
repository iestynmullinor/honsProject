Local economies reliant on limited and specialised resources, highly dependent on ecosystem services such as water and soil fertility, such as alpaca and llama herders or small-scale fishers, are among the more vulnerable (very high confidence) (Hollowed et al., 2013; Postigo, 2013; Glynn et al., 2017; Duchicela et al., 2019), along with the agricultural sector in the face of extreme events (Coayla and Culqui, 2020). Their vulnerabilities increase as a result of unequal chains of value, incomplete transfers of technology and other socioeconomic and environmental drivers (high confidence) (Ariza-Montobbio and Cuvi, 2020; Gutierrez et al., 2020).Informal housing and settlements, usually located in areas exposed to the highest level of risk, exacerbates vulnerability (very high confidence) (Miranda Sara and Baud, 2014; Cuvi, 2015; Miranda Sara et al., 2016). The absence of proper drainage systems in urban areas increases this vulnerability, especially to floods. Most cities and infrastructure are considered highly vulnerable to climate change (high confidence) (Figure 12.7).Regions dependent on glacier runoff are particularly vulnerable (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014; Mark et al., 2017; Polk et al., 2017). Also biodiversity and water-dependent activities where seasonality and rainfall patterns are changing and where other non-climatic sources of change, such as land use, affect the capacity of ecosystems to provide hydrological services (very high confidence) (Cerrón et al., 2019; Molina et al., 2020). The countries in this sub-region (Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) are among the most vulnerable in terms of well-being and health (Figure 12.7; Nagy et al., 2018).
