There is high confidence that age and socioeconomic status are key factors determining health exposure and quality of life in SWS, where low-income areas show an insufficient number of public spaces to provide acceptable environmental quality in comparison with the high-income areas (Romero-Lankao et al., 2013; Fernández and Wu, 2016; Paz et al., 2016; Hystad et al., 2019; Smith and Henríquez, 2019; Jaime et al., 2020; Pino-Cortés et al., 2020).Profound social inequalities, urban expansion and inadequate city planning (e.g., drainage network) increase exposure to flooding events and landslides (high confidence) (Müller and Höfer, 2014; Rojas et al., 2017; Lara et al., 2018), heat hazards such as heatwaves (high confidence) (Welz et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2015; Inostroza et al., 2016; Welz and Krellenberg, 2016; Krellenberg and Welz, 2017) and the loss and fragmentation of green infrastructure (GI) (Hernández-Moreno and Reyes-Paecke, 2018). SWS cities show the highest levels of air pollution of CSA (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Pino et al., 2015; Huneeus et al., 2020; González-Rojas et al., 2021), where state air quality alerts have limited effect on protective health behaviours, since public perceptions about air pollution vary widely among the population (Boso et al., 2019). In particular, human communities living in coastal cities show a negative safety perception about the performance of the infrastructure and coastal defences to flood events (low confidence) (González and Holtmann-Ahumada, 2017; Igualt et al., 2019).Although climate change is critically important for the current and future status of mining activity in SWS (Odell et al., 2018), and SWS areas subjected to mining activities are highly exposed to water risk (Northey et al., 2017), to date there is low evidence of climate change impacting mining activities (Corzo and Gamboa, 2018; Odell et al., 2018).
