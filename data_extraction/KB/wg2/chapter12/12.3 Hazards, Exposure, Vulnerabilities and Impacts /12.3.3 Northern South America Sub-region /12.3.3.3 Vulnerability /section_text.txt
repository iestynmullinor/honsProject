NSA is one of the most vulnerable sub-regions in the region, after CA, as evidenced by its very high vulnerability in four of the six sectors assessed (Figure 12.7). The LECZ of Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname are highly vulnerable to climate change due to SLR (high confidence) (CAF, 2014; Mycoo, 2014; Reguero et al., 2015; Villamizar et al., 2017; Nagy et al., 2019). In Guyana, the combined effect of increased rainfall intensity and SLR has caused flooding over the past two decades, increasing the vulnerability of the agricultural sector (Tomby and Zhang, 2019).The unprecedented extreme events of floods (2009, 2012 and 2014) and drought (2010) in the Amazon basin led to increased societal vulnerability (medium confidence: medium evidence, high agreement ) (Mansur et al., 2016; Debortoli et al., 2017; Marengo et al., 2018; Menezes et al., 2018). The disruption of the region’s natural hydrology dynamics as a consequence of extreme events increases the sensitivity of the food and transport systems of the Indigenous Peoples and rural resource-dependent communities (Pinho et al., 2015).Migration by Indigenous Peoples and rural resource-dependent communities to cities has increased due to urbanisation, development of extractive activities, agroindustry and infrastructure. Upon migrating, they are forced to abandon their livelihoods in order to acquire temporary jobs and to live in poverty and exclusion conditions on the periphery of the city (Cardoso et al., 2018). Between 60% and 90% of the population in the urban centres of ADE live in conditions of moderate to high degree of vulnerability (Mansur et al., 2016) (Figure 12.7). Amazon populations located in remote urban centres with limited or non-existent roads are more vulnerable to extreme events in relation to more connected urban centres (Parry et al., 2018). These highly risky circumstances reduce the adaptive capacity of these populations (Cardoso et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the dynamics of the adaptive capacity of Indigenous Peoples and rural resource-dependent communities is a complex issue. There is a robust and growing body of literature showing that resource-dependent communities located in remote areas address climate anomalies by reducing the vulnerability of socioecological systems through IKLK (high confidence) (Mistry et al., 2016; Vogt et al., 2016; Bilbao et al., 2019, 2020; Camico et al., 2021).Amazonian forests constitute one of the major carbon (C) sinks on Earth (Pan et al., 2011), playing a pivotal role in the climate system and regional balance of C and water (Marengo et al., 2018; Molina et al., 2019). Deforestation, temperature increase and any factor affecting forest ecosystem dynamics will have an impact on atmospheric CO2 concentrations and, hence, on the global climate (Ruiz-Vásquez et al., 2020; Sullivan et al., 2020).There is robust scientific evidence of the high vulnerability of Amazon rainforests to increasing temperature and repeated extreme drought events (high confidence) (Figure 12.7) (Brienen et al., 2015; Olivares et al., 2015; Feldpausch et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017; Anderson et al., 2018b; Anjos and De Toledo, 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Barkhordarian et al., 2019; Sampaio et al., 2019; Rammig, 2020; Sullivan et al., 2020).
