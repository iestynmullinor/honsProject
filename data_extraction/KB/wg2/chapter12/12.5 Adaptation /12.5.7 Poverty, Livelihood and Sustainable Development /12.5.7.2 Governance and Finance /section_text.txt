Poor and most vulnerable groups have limited political influence, fewer capacities and opportunities to participate in decision and policymaking and are less able to leverage government support to invest in adaptation measures linked with poverty, inequality and vulnerability reduction (very high confidence)  (Chapter 8; Miranda Sara et al., 2017; Reyer et al., 2017; Kalikoski et al., 2018; Dodman et al., 2019; Satterthwaite et al., 2020).Existing imbalances in power relations, corruption, historic structural problems and high levels of risk tolerance (Miranda Sara et al., 2016) constitute climate governance barriers to implementing more effective adaptation and preventive measures. Corruption, particularly in the construction and infrastructure sectors, has proven to be a barrier to CSA development, even reproducing and reconstructing the same risks (French and Mechler, 2017; Vergara, 2018; Durand, 2019). Critical infrastructure and valuable assets continue to be placed in vulnerable areas (Calil et al., 2017; Escalante Estrada and Miranda, 2020), demonstrating the persistence of maladaptation and adaptation deficit (Villamizar et al., 2017).Social organisation, participation and governance reconfiguration are essential for building climate resilience (very high confidence) (Stein and Moser, 2015; Kalikoski et al., 2018; Satterthwaite et al., 2018, 2020; Stein et al., 2018; Hardoy et al., 2019; Stein, 2019; Miranda Sara, 2021). Adaptation measures have trade-offs that need to be acknowledged and acted upon, most importantly by developing the capacity to convene discussions that draw in all key actors and commit them to do things differently (Almeida et al., 2018; Hardoy et al., 2019). Collaborative approaches integrate groups and organisations (e.g., saving, women’s groups, clubs, vendor associations, cooperatives) contributing to the exchange of information to visibilise people’s needs, generate safety networks and negotiate for improvements and enhance adaptive capacity.
