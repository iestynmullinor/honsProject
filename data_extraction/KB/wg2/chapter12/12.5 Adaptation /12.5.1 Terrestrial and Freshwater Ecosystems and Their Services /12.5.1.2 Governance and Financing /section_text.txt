All CSA countries have formulated policies that include measures relevant for socioecosystem adaptation in their NCs, NDCs and NAPs, with an emphasis on protecting and restoring water and forests (high confidence). Existing proposed measures, instruments and programmes, however, do not yet reflect the vision needed to integrate the ecosystem and human dimensions of vulnerability. Administration coordination and the progress in adaptive ecosystem management are still in their early stages, due in part to the lack of stable financial resources and scientific knowledge and IKLK about adapting ecosystems to climate change (Bustamante et al., 2020). Brazil was an exception, showing dramatic policy-driven reduction in deforestation in the Amazon between 2004â€“2012, with a concomitant 70% increase in soy production, the most profitable Amazon crop (Hansen et al., 2013; Nepstad et al., 2014). Policies included territorial planning (protected areas, Indigenous territories and land tenure), satellite monitoring and market and credit restrictions on high-deforesting municipalities, plus some incentives to small farmers (Boucher et al., 2013; Hansen et al., 2013; Nepstad et al., 2014; Castelo, 2015; Cunha et al., 2016a). It is important to highlight the important role of Indigenous territories, in addition to protected areas, in forest conservation in the Amazon (high evidence, medium agreement ) (Schwartzman et al., 2013; Barber et al., 2014; Nepstad et al., 2014; Walker et al., 2014b). These policies were partially funded by results-based compensation through the Amazon Fund. Since 2012, however, policies and institutions have weakened, and Amazon deforestation rates have started to rise (Carvalho et al., 2019), becoming more acute in recent years (Silva Junior et al., 2021). Conservation incentives, a new complementary and allegedly cost-effective approach, is increasingly being implemented in the region (Magrin et al., 2014). They include PES, REDD+, environmental certification and conservation easements, but remain controversial, and more research is needed on their effectiveness, possible negative side effects, participatory management systems and collective decision-making processes (Larson and Petkova, 2011; Locatelli et al., 2011; Pinho et al., 2014; Strassburg et al., 2014; Mistry et al., 2016; Gebara and Agrawal, 2017; Scarano et al., 2018; Ruggiero et al., 2019; To and Dressler, 2019; Vallet et al., 2019).
