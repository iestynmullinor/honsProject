National Risk Management Plans or National Disaster Response Plans are tools for adapting to climate change that can help to diminish death and injuries from disasters (high confidence). These plans are generally promoted by governments as national instruments that guide the processes of estimating, preventing and reducing disaster risk. Updated National Risk Management Plans have been found for Guatemala (CONRED, 2014), Honduras (COPECO, 2014), El Salvador (Ministry of Health of El Salvador, 2017), Costa Rica (CNE, 2016), Ecuador (SGR, 2018), Peru (SGRD et al., 2014), Argentina (Ministerio de Seguridad de Argentina, 2018), Bolivia (VIDECI, 2017), Chile (ONEMI, 2015) and Colombia (UNGRD, 2015). It has been shown in Brazil that information on drought conditions can be used to reduced health impacts of drought using a national disaster risk reduction framework (Sena et al., 2016).
