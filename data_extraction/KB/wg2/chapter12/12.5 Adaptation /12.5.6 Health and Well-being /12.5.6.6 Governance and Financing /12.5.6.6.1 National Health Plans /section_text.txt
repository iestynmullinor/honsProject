Some countries have developed national plans on health including the role of climate. Chile has a Climate Change Adaptation Plan of the Health Sector that proposes several actions to enhance monitoring, institutions and citizen information and education (Ministry of Health of Chile and Ministry of Environment of Chile, 2016). Based on the identification of vulnerability to climate change, Colombia has developed 11 regional adaptation plans to strengthen institutional capacities, climate-change education for behavioural changes and cost estimation to promote health resilience (WHO and UNFCCC, 2015). In addition, El Salvador implemented actions to strengthen health infrastructure using high latrines for housing in flood communities, as well as other measures focused on water supply and quality based on an education and awareness programme (Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of El Salvador, 2013). Only Brazil and Peru have implemented actions so far in the region derived from national health adaptation plans, and only Brazil completed a national assessment of impacts, vulnerability and adaptation for health (Watts et al., 2018). Some countries include health as a priority sector in their NAPs, as in the case of Ecuador and Costa Rica, which has a national plan addressing the prevention and care of climate-sensitive diseases coupled with a National Health Plan (2016–2020) (Ministry of Health Costa Rica, 2016; Jiménez, n. d.).
