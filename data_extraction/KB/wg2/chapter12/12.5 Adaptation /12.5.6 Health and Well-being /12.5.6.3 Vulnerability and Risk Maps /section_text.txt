Vulnerability and risk maps have been widely used as an adaptation strategy to understand the potential impacts of climate on health outcomes both directly (e.g., maps of disease risk) and indirectly (e.g., maps of populations vulnerable to climate disasters) (high confidence). There are many examples of where climate services have been used to construct vulnerability maps for health outcomes, including maps in the aforementioned climate–health observatories. Dengue, malaria and Zika vulnerability maps using climate, social and environmental information have been developed in Brazil and Colombia (Cunha et al., 2016b; López-Álvarez, 2016; Pereda, 2016; IDEAM, 2017). Argentina focuses on improving its health system using a climate change risk map system as a tool that identifies the risks and allows assessing their management (OPS and WHO, 2018).Vulnerability and risk maps for climate disasters have been developed at the city level, for example in Bogota, Cartagena de Indias and Mocoa in Colombia (Yamin et al., 2013; Guzman Torres and Barrera Arciniegas, 2014; Tehelen and Pacha, 2017; Zamora, 2018), and for the metropolitan district of Quito in Ecuador (Tehelen and Pacha, 2017). In addition, vulnerability maps were created for the primary road network of Colombia (Tehelen and Pacha, 2017). At the regional level, vulnerability maps using climate-change probability, disaster risk and food insecurity variables have been produced for the Andean region (WFP, 2014). In Brazil, vulnerability maps that consider exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, coupled with climate scenarios, were designed to support the NAP on a municipal scale (Chang and Garcia, 2018; Duval et al., 2018; Marinho and Silva, 2018; Menezes, 2018; Santos and Marinho, 2018; Silva et al., 2018). A Climate Change Vulnerability Index was used to generate vulnerability maps for countries of the Latin American and Caribbean region (Vörösmarty et al., 2013; CAF, 2014).
