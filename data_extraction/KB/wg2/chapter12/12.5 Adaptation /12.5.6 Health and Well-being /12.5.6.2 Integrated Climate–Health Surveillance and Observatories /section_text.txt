Integrated climate–health surveillance systems are another key adaptation strategy (medium confidence). This information can be used by the health sector to inform decision-making about when and where to deploy a public health intervention. It can also feed into an EWS, particularly if the data are compatible in format and spatiotemporal scales. An integrated climate–health surveillance system for vector-borne disease control was developed in southern coastal Ecuador through a partnership among the climate and health sectors and academia (Borbor-Cordova et al., 2016; Lowe et al., 2017). Additionally, an interdisciplinary multi-national team working at the border of Ecuador and Peru created a cooperation network for climate-informed dengue surveillance (Quichi et al., 2016), and their successful binational collaboration resulted in the local elimination of malaria (Krisher et al., 2016). A similar tool is innovative community-based data collection to understand and find solutions to rainfall-related diarrheal diseases in Ecuador (Palacios et al., 2016).Climate and health observatories represent a promising strategy that is being developed at sub-national, national (e.g., Brazil, Argentina) and regional levels (high confidence) (Muñoz et al., 2016; Rusticucci et al., 2020). The Brazilian Observatory of Climate and Health brings together climate and health information for the Amazon region of Manaus (Barcellos et al., 2016). At the national level, Brazil has created a climate and health observatory, where information and data visualisations are available for various climate-sensitive health indicators (Ministério da Saúde and FIOCRUZ, 2021).
