Diverse adaptation measures are being implemented through public policies, private household responses and communal management that directly or indirectly reduce the impacts of climate change on human health (high confidence) (Table 12.9). Private and communal management measures could be considered indirect measures because they might be adopted even in the absence of climate change.Table 12.9 | Hazards from climate change that impact human health and examples of adaptation strategies proposed or implemented in CSA.

This approach is also relevant when considering new places where vector-borne diseases can emerge because of changes in climate (Andersson et al., 2015).Adaptation strategies implemented by the public sector include a diverse suite of strategies ranging from the creation of green spaces in urban areas, relocation of families located in disaster-prone areas, ecosystem restoration and improved access to clean water, among many others (high confidence) (Table 12.9). Building GGI has been a popular public adaptation measure to reduce deaths and injuries because of floods (Section 12.5.5.3.2). Infrastructure has been improved at schools, public buildings and drainage systems in cities such as Bogota, Colombia (World Bank, 2014) and La Paz, Bolivia (Fernández and Buss, 2016). In Brazil, channel works were implemented to reduce the flooding of the Tiete River, which crosses the metropolitan area of São Paulo; these projects were designed based on simulated flood scenarios (Hori et al., 2017).Another example of a public adaptation measure is the protection and restoration of natural areas, which have the potential to decrease the transmission of water- and vector-borne infectious diseases (medium confidence: robust evidence, low agreement ). Studies have shown that these measures can diminish the cases of malaria and diarrhoea in Brazil and cases of diarrhoea in children in Colombia (Bauch et al., 2015; Herrera et al., 2017; Chaves et al., 2018). However, deforestation and malaria have a complex relationship that relies on local context interactions, where land use and land cover changes play an important role due to vector ecology alterations and social conditions of human settlements (Rubio-Palis et al., 2013). Forest conservation can improve hydrological cycle control and soil erosion that can help to improve water quality and reduce the burden of water-borne diseases. In addition, forest cover can help to diminish the habitat for larval mosquitoes that transmit malaria. These measures can help to design policies at sites where these problems do not currently exist but can emerge as a consequence of climate change and the increase in the frequency of weather extreme events.
