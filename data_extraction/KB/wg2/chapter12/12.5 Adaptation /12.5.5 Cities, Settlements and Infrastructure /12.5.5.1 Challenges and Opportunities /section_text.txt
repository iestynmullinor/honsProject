The inequality, poverty and informality shaping cities in the region increase vulnerability to climate change (high confidence) (Romero-Lankao et al., 2014; Rasch, 2017; Filho et al., 2019) and can hinder adaptation (Section 12.5.7.1), while interventions addressing these social challenges and the existing development deficits (e.g., build or improve infrastructure and housing applying climate-adapted patterns) can go hand in hand with adaptation and mitigation (medium confidence: high agreement, medium evidence) (Section 12.5.7.3; Creutzig et al., 2016; Le, 2020; Satterthwaite et al., 2020). Over 20% of the urban population in Latin America and the Caribbean live in slums and many other forms of precarious and segregated neighbourhoods, settled in risk areas and lacking infrastructure (Rasch, 2017; UN-Habitat, 2018; Rojas, 2019). This vulnerable condition is boosted by unstable political and governmental institutions, which suffer from ongoing corruption, weak governance and reduced capacity to finance adaptation (Rasch, 2016). Facing governance challenges by including diverse stakeholders and encouraging and learning from community-based experiences has also presented the opportunity to improve adaptation strategies (Archer et al., 2014). An example of this is the Regional Climate Change Adaptation Plan of Santiago (Krellenberg and Katrin, 2014).
