The lack of a high multi-level and intersectoral governance capacity with strong multi-player horizontal and vertical coordination and long-term support limit adaptation in the region (high confidence) (Anguelovski et al., 2014; Bai et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2016; Schaller et al., 2016; Miranda Sara et al., 2017). The ability to enrol stakeholders and include community-based initiatives can determine adaptation success, particularly considering their impact in the decision-making arena (high confidence) (Section 12.5.8.1; Section 6.4; Anguelovski et al., 2014; Archer et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2017; Rosenzweig et al., 2018).Lima’s Climate Action Strategy is an example (Metropolitan Municipality of Lima, 2014). It was approved following a participatory and consultative process with the technical group on climate change from the Metropolitan Environmental Commission, focusing on the reduction of water vulnerabilities to drought and heavy rain, on the basis of which 10 (out of 51 with Callao) Lima district municipalities are developing and starting to implement adaptation measures (Foro Ciudades Para la Vida, 2021). In 2021 the municipality of Lima also approved its Local Climate Change Plan (Metropolitan Municipality of Lima, 2021) under a similar process. The engagement of local players was central to spreading and mobilising different types of knowledge and creating networks able to support adaptation (Section 12.6.3; Miranda Sara and Baud, 2014; Miranda Sara et al., 2017). The inclusive process is also a goal based on the example of Chile Municipalities Network Facing Climate Change (RedMuniCC) engaged in developing participatory strategic plans for climate adaptation and mitigation (RedMuniCC, 2021).New forms of financing and leadership focused on community-based approaches have been developed to overcome the funding challenge and enable adaptation in the region (medium confidence: medium evidence, medium agreement ) (Castán Broto and Bulkeley, 2013; Archer et al., 2014; Paterson and Charles, 2019). Systems for measuring, reporting and verifying adaptation financing, as in Colombia (Guzmán et al., 2018), or a national legislation geared towards adaptation, can also help access funds. The Peruvian Law on the Retribution Mechanism of Eco-Systemic Services and Code (Miranda Sara and Baud, 2014; MINAM Peru, 2016) in addition to the Ley Marco de la Gestión y Prestación de los Servicios de Saneamiento and Its Code (Ministerio de Vivienda, Construcción y Saneamiento de Perú, 2017), allowed potable water companies to add 1% to the bill to guarantee ecosystem services, water treatment and reuse with GI. Another 4% of bill go to developing and implementing adaptation plans and measures (Government of Peru, 2016).
