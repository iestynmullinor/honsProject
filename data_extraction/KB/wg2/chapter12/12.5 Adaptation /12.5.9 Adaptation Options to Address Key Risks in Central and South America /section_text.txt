This section integrates, in Table 12.10 as follows, the sectoral assessment of adaptation options (Sections 12.5.1â€“12.5.8) with the eight key risks assessed in the region (Section 12.4). Table 12.10 presents a list of the summarised adaptation options, which are detailed in their adaptation sections, from Section 12.5.1 to Section 12.5.8 in this chapter.Table 12.10 | Adaptation options addressing key risks organised by sector. See the note at the end for descriptions of the sector name abbreviations.1.
