For agrifood systems, the adoption of agroforestry provides for more diverse and sustainable agricultural production, where farmers maintain or improve their current production by incorporating suitable trees that ameliorate climatic conditions. Thus, in the same unit of land, these systems incorporate exotic tree species or managed native forests into farming systems allowing for the simultaneous production of trees, crops and livestock with different spatial arrangements or temporal sequences. On the other hand, it is recognised that the initial investment and time until trees start to produce may create an economic vulnerability. Therefore, there is a need to design adequate programmes and allocate resources for agroforestry system implementation and technical assistance and training (medium confidence). Also, some market schemes such as PES and certification can help to reduce this vulnerability.
