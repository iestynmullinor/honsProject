For the health sector, we assessed the barriers and facilitators for the implementation of climate-driven EWSs under natural extreme events and epidemic situations. We found institutional dimensions to be potential barriers. These included the legal and regulatory feasibility, institutional capacity and administrative feasibility, transparency and political acceptability (high confidence). The fewest barriers were identified for the economic and environmental dimensions.One of the main institutional challenges is the lack of policy with climateâ€“health linkages. Opportunities include a national plan for the health sector to address the impacts of climate change by formalising collaborations via agreements memoranda of understanding (MOUs). Another key barrier is that relatively few institutions in the region have the human technical and administrative capacity to implement and operate an EWS. Regional platforms may provide a solution for technical assistance at national levels.On the other hand, the economic dimensions faced relatively few barriers, although the initial costs of designing, implementing, equipping and maintaining the system are a potential barrier for health-related sectors with reduced budgets. However, the health benefits and economic savings (due to averted epidemics or damage from disasters) may offset these costs. The resilience built into the health sector by these systems may be applicable to other economic sectors that could benefit from the early warning of an immenent extreme event and associated health impacts.
