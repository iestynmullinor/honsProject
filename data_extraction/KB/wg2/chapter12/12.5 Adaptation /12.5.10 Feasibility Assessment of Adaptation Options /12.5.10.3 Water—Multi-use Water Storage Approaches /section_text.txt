For the water sector, geophysical and economic dimensions do not pose a major barrier thanks to the potential reduction of flood hazard exposure, physical-technical viability of project implementation, different suitable economic mechanisms for joint public-private financing and more efficient water use. However, limited institutional capacities and the social-environmental impacts of large water infrastructure (Section 12.5.3) reduce the institutional, social, environmental and, to some extent, technological feasibility. This may be a potential barrier to the adaptive approach of multi-use water storage (medium confidence).
