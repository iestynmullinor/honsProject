There is low evidence and high agreement  that empowering local stakeholders (e.g., multi-lateral fisheries agreements) improves public awareness and simplifies regulations and increases the flexibility and sustainability of marine resources managed in fisheries under future scenarios (Weatherdon et al., 2016; Kalikoski et al., 2019). Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) has emerged as a suitable tool to minimise the risk to climate change, avoid ecosystem degradation and related services (Gullestad et al., 2017). Further, when EBFM includes climate complexity and the relationships among species within the ecological systems it contributes to maintain long-term socioeconomic benefits (Long et al., 2015). There is high confidence that EbA is more successful and feasible than hard coastal defences for the protection, management and restoration of ocean and coastal ecosystems and their resources (Spalding et al., 2014; González and Holtmann-Ahumada, 2017; Scarano, 2017).There is high confidence that ecological and social resilience is improved by the presence of adequate metrics to evaluate adaptation measures to allow dynamic changes; and by increasing basic research and climate data (Moreno et al., 2020b). Resilience also increases with the existence of EWSs, improved local institutions, the construction of adequate infrastructure, major funding for capacity building and the enhanced engagement and empowerment of women (FAO, 2016b; Harper et al., 2017; Frangoudes and Gerrard, 2018; Gallardo-Fernández and Saunders, 2018; Leal Filho, 2018).
