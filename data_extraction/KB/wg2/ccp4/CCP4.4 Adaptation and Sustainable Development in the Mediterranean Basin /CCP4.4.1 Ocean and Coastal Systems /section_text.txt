Adaptation options for climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and fisheries include improving and enlarging the regional network of marine protected areas, transnational management of marine food resources, sustainable fishery practices, developing collaborative monitoring, research and managing knowledge platforms for fisheries (Bjørkan et al., 2020; Raicevich et al., 2020) and sustainable aquaculture (Ehlers, 2016; Lacroix, 2016).Adaptation options to sea level rise in the Mediterranean include nature-based solutions, such as beach and shore nourishment, dune restoration, or ecosystem-based adaptation and restoration in low-lying coasts, lagoons, estuaries and deltas (Aragonés et al., 2015; Aspe et al., 2016; Loizidou et al., 2016; Danovaro et al., 2018). Engineering plays a major role for coastal adaptation too, through breakwaters, seawalls, dykes, surge barriers and submerged breakwaters (Sancho-García et al., 2013; Becchi et al., 2014; Balouin et al., 2015; Masria et al., 2015; Tsoukala et al., 2015; Bouvier et al., 2017). Many engineering-based coastal adaptation imply large residual impacts on coastal ecosystems (high confidence) (Micheli et al., 2013; Masria et al., 2015; Cooper et al., 2016; Bonnici et al., 2018). A sea surface height control dam at the Strait of Gibraltar has been proposed for mitigating sea level rise in the Mediterranean, but this would likely  involve major impacts on ecosystems and fisheries (Gower, 2015).
