Adaptation options to address water shortages at the national scale include transboundary resource management (Escriva-Bou et al., 2017; Pulido-Velazquez et al., 2018), promoting fair, equitable and sustainable water trade in international markets (Johansson et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2019), regional, national and basin-scale management plans for water resources (Wilhite et al., 2014; Paneque, 2015; Urquijo et al., 2015; Estrela and Sancho, 2016; Vargas and Paneque, 2019), improved groundwater monitoring and strategic management (Pulido-Velazquez et al., 2020), and economic instruments to manage water demand (prices policies, markets and subsidies).Technical options include the reduction of losses in water distribution networks for drinking water and irrigation (Burak and Margat, 2016; Fader et al., 2016), desalinisation, often combined with generation of electricity (Papanicolas et al., 2016; Bonanos et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2019), artificial recharge of groundwater and subterranean dams (Djuma et al., 2017; De Giglio et al., 2018; Missimer and Maliva, 2018; Baena-Ruiz et al., 2020), and waste water reuse (Kalavrouziotis et al., 2015; Barba-Suñol et al., 2018; Cherfouh et al., 2018). On the demand side, options include changing diet and water consumption patterns (Blas et al., 2016; Gul et al., 2017; Blas et al., 2018), and enhancing water use efficiency in the tourism and food sectors (Hadjikakou et al., 2013; Moresi, 2014).In the agriculture sector, improved efficiency of irrigation practices can be achieved by changing surface water irrigation for other techniques and shifting to more sustainable practices (Mrabet et al., 2012; Benlhabib et al., 2014; Boari et al., 2015; Ćosić et al., 2015; Guilherme et al., 2015; Iglesias and Garrote, 2015; Cantore et al., 2016; Triberti et al., 2016; AbdAllah et al., 2018; Billen et al., 2018; Iglesias et al., 2018; Malek and Verburg, 2018; Vargas and Paneque, 2019). Overall, the region could save 35% of water resources by improved irrigation techniques (Fader et al., 2016). However, maladaptive drip irrigation subsidies and developments can also result in the unsustainable use of groundwater resources and excessive agriculture intensification, indicating the need for careful strategic planning, regulation and monitoring of these options (Venot et al., 2017). In the livestock sector, adaptation options for heat wave-induced mortality of animals include the choice of more resistant genetic provenances (Rojas-Downing et al., 2017).Other adaptation options in the agricultural sector include agro-ecological techniques that increase the water retention capacity of soils (mulching, zero tillage, reduced tillage, etc.) (Aguilera et al., 2013a; Aguilera et al., 2013b; Almagro et al., 2016; Sanz-Cobena et al., 2017; Tomaz et al., 2017; Bhakta et al., 2019; García-Tejero et al., 2020) and promoting crop diversification, adapting the crop calendar and the use of new varieties adapted to evolving conditions. Many of these strategies for more sustainable production are also intended to address the food security risks and import dependence in the region. Other options are to manage nitrogen resources, food demand, change diets and reduce food waste (Billen et al., 2018; Schils et al., 2018; Billen et al., 2019; Garnier et al., 2019; Aguilera et al., 2020; Lassaletta et al., 2021).
