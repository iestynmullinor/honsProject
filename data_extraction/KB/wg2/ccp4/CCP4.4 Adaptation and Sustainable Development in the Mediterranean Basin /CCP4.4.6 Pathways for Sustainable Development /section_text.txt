Climate-resilient sustainable development pathways are trajectories that combine adaptation and mitigation to realise the goal of sustainable development through iterative, continually evolving socioecological processes (Chapters 1; 18; Denton et al., 2014). Transformative adaptation can be promoted through social and political processes, identifying the enabling conditions and strategies that facilitate structural changes (UNEP/MAP, 2016; Ramieri et al., 2018; EC, 2020; UNEP/MAP and Plan Bleu, 2020). The main options include ongoing structural change in the renewable energy system in this region, the production of renewable biological resources, measures towards increased water irrigation efficiency, behavioural changes in multiple sectors and improved regional governance (Table CCP4.2; Cramer et al., 2018).Table CCP4.2 | Transformative adaptation and mitigation options for climate-resilient sustainable development in the Mediterranean Basin.CodeSectorTransformative optionReferencesT1Energy, transport and tourismNational plans and regulations to decarbonise fuel sources and electricity grids on the supply side, for reducing energy demand and increasing efficiency and converting transport systems from fossil fuels to electricity.UNEP/MAP (2016); Bastianin et al.

(2015)There also are risks for nonlinear climate change impacts in key socioeconomic and environmental processes, which could promote reactive changes and forced transformations (Table CCP4.3).Table CCP4.3 | Nonlinear processes that could force reactive changes and social transformations for climate-resilient sustainable development in the Mediterranean Basin. Nonlinearity implies the absence of a straight-line relationship between the independent variable and the response variable. In other words, changes in the output do not change in direct proportion to changes in the independent variable and the form of the relationship is often described by applying nonlinear mathematical models. Gradual changes induced by climate warming in thermal exposure or rainfall availability can induce nonlinear effects on social and ecological response variables.CodeSectorProcessesReferencesP1Agriculture and migrationAdverse nonlinear impacts of temperature on agricultural productivity can induce nonlinear effect on human migration. The temperature–migration relationship is nonlinear and resembles the nonlinear temperature–yield relationship. These relationships affect mostly agriculture-dependent countries and especially people in those countries whose livelihoods depend on agriculture.Reuveny (2007); Schlenker and Roberts (2009); Cai et al. (2016)P3All societal sectorsThe increase in climatic impacts and catastrophic events is associated with nonlinear changes in economic and social impacts.Burke et al. (2014); Burke et al.

Higher temperature may reduce GDP in Mediterranean agricultural countries more than non-agricultural countries. Extreme heat over 30°C significantly reduces the GDP of agricultural countries but not the non-agricultural ones. GDP is a main determinant of international migration. The nonlinear relationship between GDP and temperature in agricultural countries provides indirect evidence for the agricultural linkage between temperature and migration.Dell et al.

(2018); Koubi (2018); Baylis (2020)P7Food, health and demographyIn low-income areas of the Mediterranean Basin and sub-Saharan Africa regions higher poverty rates, malnutrition and elevated infant mortality are coupled with higher fertility, implying a higher rate of population growth that in turn can generate more poverty. These demographic cycles can in turn interact with climatic impacts and conflict-induced displacement and migration processes.Vörösmarty et al. (2000); Barrios et al.

High temperatures provoke demand surges while straining supply and transmission.Carleton and Hsiang (2016)P9IndustryNonlinear effects of temperature on industrial production.Hsiang and Meng (2015)In the Mediterranean Basin, indicators for progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) show multiple directions of transformative change (Sachs et al., 2019). In some sectors, such as energy, there are general positive trends in sustainability (UNEP/MAP, 2016), but there also are significant imbalances between northern and southern shores of the basin for most SDGs. Over the coming decades the Mediterranean Basin will likely  experience sustained growth in renewable energy investments, accompanied by a shift in regional geographical patterns of energy demand (OME, 2018). However, future developmental pathways, solution space and feasible system transformations could be constrained by multiple factors for several SDGs, such as social conflicts, lack of regional governance, limited action capacity and financial constraints (Figure CCP4.9; Table CCP4.3).Figure CCP4.9 | Differences in present-day SDG indicator values between northern (blue) and southern (gold) Mediterranean countries. Yellow-shaded areas indicate better indicator values for the SDG descriptor. Red-shaded areas indicate poor performance on SDG values.
