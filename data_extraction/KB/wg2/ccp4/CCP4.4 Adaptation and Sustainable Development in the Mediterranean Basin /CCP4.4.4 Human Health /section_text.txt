In the Mediterranean region, adapting to increasing heat wave impacts involves local urban health adaptation plans, as well as increasing the capacity of healthcare systems (Fernandez Milan and Creutzig, 2015; Larsen, 2015; Paz et al., 2016; Liotta et al., 2018; Reckien et al., 2018; Tsiros et al., 2018). Local urban adaptation strategies need to be integrative and address housing and infrastructure, the increase and design of urban green areas, education and awareness-raising of the most vulnerable communities, the implementation of early warning systems for extreme events and the surveillance of climate change induced diseases, the strengthening of local emergency and healthcare services, and the general strengthening adaptive capacity of the community and of the local institutions.
