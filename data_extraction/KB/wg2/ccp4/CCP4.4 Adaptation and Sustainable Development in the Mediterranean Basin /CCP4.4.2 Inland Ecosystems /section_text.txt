In forests, adaptation to impacts of warming and drought may involve multiple forest management strategies, such as thinning (Fernández-de-Uña et al., 2015; Giuggiola et al., 2016; Aldea et al., 2017; del Río et al., 2017; Gleason et al., 2017; Lechuga et al., 2017; Vilà-Cabrera et al., 2018), increasing the share of drought-tolerant species and provenances (Hlásny et al., 2014; Calvo et al., 2016), or promoting mixed-species stands (Ruiz-Benito et al., 2014; Guyot et al., 2016; Sánchez-Pinillos et al., 2016; del Río et al., 2017; Jactel et al., 2017; Ratcliffe et al., 2017).Adaptation options to increased fire risks include improved planning of residential development such as to avoid inevitable wildfire (Schoennagel et al., 2017; Samara et al., 2018), improved fire suppression capacities and strategies (Brotons et al., 2013; Regos et al., 2014; Khabarov et al., 2016; Turco et al., 2018a; 2018b), managing and planning landscape matrix schemes to reduce fire risk (de Rigo et al., 2017; Erdős et al., 2018), thinning, slash management and prescribed burning techniques (Fernandes et al., 2016; 2018; Khabarov et al., 2016; Regos et al., 2016; Piqué and Domènech, 2018; Samara et al., 2018; Vilà-Cabrera et al., 2018; Duane et al., 2019), as well as understory grazing (Varga et al., 2016; Vilà-Cabrera et al., 2018).Adaptation of forest management generally requires improved monitoring systems of forest condition and natural disturbances (Hlásny et al., 2014; Hengeveld et al., 2015; Maes et al., 2015), supported by participatory forest management and planning processes and local self-governance mechanisms (Bouriaud et al., 2013; 2015).For freshwater ecosystems, adaptation options include hydrological and land use planning at basin scale, which can be complemented with local conservation and restoration efforts, and the preservation of natural flow variability of rivers and streams (Aspe et al., 2016; Loizidou et al., 2016; Cid et al., 2017; Menció and Boix, 2018; Morant et al., 2020).
