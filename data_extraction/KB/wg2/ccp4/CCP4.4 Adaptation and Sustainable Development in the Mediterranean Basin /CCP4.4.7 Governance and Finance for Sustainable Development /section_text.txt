Several multilateral institutions are managing international environmental governance in the Mediterranean Sea, including, (a) the Barcelona Convention or Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean (established under the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP), (b) the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM, a subsidiary of the FAO) and (iii) the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea (ACCOBAMS, also under UNEP). These institutions act cooperatively pursuing synergies and greater effectiveness (Lacroix, 2016). The Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP) under the Barcelona Convention System involves 21 Mediterranean countries and the EU and promotes the Mediterranean Strategy for Sustainable Development (MSSD), coordinated by the Mediterranean Commission on Sustainable Development (MCSD) (UNEP/MAP, 2016). MAP is primarily financed by national governments and the EU. Its financial capacity for regional environmental governance remains limited, with available annual funds in the range of 5â€“10 million Euro (Humphrey and Lucas, 2015).Bilateral public climate finance in the Mediterranean area includes loans by multilateral development banks, bilateral official development aid and international climate fund projects (Midgley et al., 2018; Tagliapietra, 2018). Bilateral public and private financial resources invested in international climate finance in southern Mediterranean countries are two orders of magnitude greater than the existing multilateral regional governance programmes for the environment (EC, 2018; Midgley et al., 2018; Fosse et al., 2019). The MSSD is a tool for enhancing the governance of environmental issues, proposing the biannual reporting by the national parties of a set of quantitative indicators, including the commitments and obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change climate agreement, and other climate change mitigation and adaptation policy actions.Existing legal and institutional structures can facilitate coordination and collaboration across scales (DeCaro et al., 2017). Legislative mechanisms, such as the rules governing water uses in time of drought, already exist in some Mediterranean countries, but they might not be suitable to cope with irreversible changes (e.g., the depletion of groundwater aquifers) or be flexible enough to respond to the needs of water users under a changing climate (Nanni, 2012). Although legislation can be recognised as a tool in support of adaptive water management, there is a need for better coordination among the various legal provisions that define institutional roles and set out the mechanisms for the management of water resources across different scales (regional/national/sub-national) and sectors (agriculture, industry, urban, energy).
