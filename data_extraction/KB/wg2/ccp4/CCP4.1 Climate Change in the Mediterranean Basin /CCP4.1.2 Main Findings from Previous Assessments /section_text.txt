All previous assessments of climate change for the Mediterranean Basin and its sub-regions indicate ongoing warming of the atmosphere and the sea, as well as projected warming and changes in rainfall (Stocker et al., 2013; Cherif et al., 2020). The projected increase in climate hazards, in combination with high regional vulnerability and exposure make it a prominent ‘climate change hotspot’ (Giorgi, 2006), with a large number of vulnerable natural systems and socioeconomic sectors (Field et al., 2014; MedECC, 2020). In addition to high temperatures, the main risk factor identified is drought, generally expected to increase in the region, significant already at global warming of only 1.5°C, reaching, for higher warming levels, intensities unprecedented during the past 10 ka (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018). In Southern Europe and North Africa, groundwater recharge and soil water content will consequently decline, especially during summer (Kovats et al., 2014; Niang et al., 2014).With the changing climate, marine ecosystems have already undergone changes in structure, including the spread of tropical species from the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea (high confidence) and mass mortality in at least 25 invertebrate species, threatening, along with ocean acidification, marine ecosystems, including seagrass meadows (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2014; Nurse et al., 2014; Pörtner et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014). Endemic marine species are at higher risk of extinction due to limited possibilities for migrating northward (Kovats et al., 2014; Poloczanska et al., 2014; Balzan et al., 2020). Southern and eastern Mediterranean coastal systems with narrow dune belts and often rapid urbanisation are vulnerable to both warming and sea level rise (Seneviratne et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2014; Balzan et al., 2020).Most Mediterranean land ecosystems are impacted negatively by drier conditions, causing the ranges of many endemic species to shrink, and the health and growth rates of trees to decline (Kovats et al., 2014; Niang et al., 2014; Nurse et al., 2014; Settele et al., 2014). Climate change is expected to increase wildfire risk in the region (Kovats et al., 2014), although earlier estimates of burnt area have been reduced in the most recent assessments to approx. 40–100%, considering that prevention and mitigation actions have successfully reduced this risk so far (Balzan et al., 2020). Wetlands and mountain summits are hotspots for biodiversity loss and extinctions (medium confidence) (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014; Nurse et al., 2014; IPBES, 2018a; IPBES, 2018b; Balzan et al., 2020). Along with unsustainable land use practices, climate change is projected to increase soil erosion in semiarid areas (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014).The increasing water scarcity was found to be a significant threat to agriculture (Jiménez Cisneros et al., 2014; Kovats et al., 2014; Niang et al., 2014; Mrabet et al., 2020). Associated with increased extreme temperatures, the Mediterranean is expected to become less attractive for tourism (Kovats et al., 2014; Nurse et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014; Dos Santos et al., 2020). Several critical risks for human health increase due to climate change, including heat waves and vector-borne diseases (Kovats et al., 2014; Nurse et al., 2014; Linares et al., 2020). Adaptation options have been identified for many risks (buildings, water management, coastal protection, etc.) (Murray et al., 2012; Revi et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014). There are synergies between adaptation and mitigation, for example, renewable energies or nature-based solutions focused on the conservation and restoration of ecosystems (Nurse et al., 2014; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; Vafeidis et al., 2020).
