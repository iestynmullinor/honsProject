The Mediterranean Basin, known for its exceptional environmental and socio-cultural richness, comprises the semi-enclosed Mediterranean Sea and the countries and regions bordering it, 3  which belong to Europe, Asia and Africa (Figure CCP4.1). The region has a unique historical and environmental identity (Abulafia, 2011), despite undeniable variations in the environment, socioeconomic conditions and cultural traditions. The countries in the Mediterranean Basin hosted approximately 542 million people in 2020, a number which is expected to increase to 657 million by 2050 and 694 million by 2100. In 1950, only 23.7% of the Mediterranean population lived in countries of the south, this number increased to 41.2% in 2000, 46.3% in 2020, and is projected to reach 55.5% in 2050 and 64.6% in 2100 (UN DESA, 2019).Figure CCP4.1 | The Mediterranean region: Topography and bathymetry (colour bar in metres), main urban areas (population in thousands for 2020 from w ww. naturalearthdata.com ), container ports (millions of TEU [twenty-foot container equivalent units] in 2017, from International Association of Ports and Harbours) and borders of the Mediterranean region used in WGI AR6 Chapter 10 (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2021).
