The Mediterranean region is predominantly vulnerable to the impacts of warming, notably prolonged and stronger heat waves, increased drought in an already dry climate and risk of coastal flooding (Section CCP4.1). southern and eastern countries are generally more vulnerable than countries in the north. Several countries (Tunisia, Algeria and Libya) are below the water scarcity threshold set by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); others (Morocco) are close to the threshold for severe water stress. Uncertainties regarding the timing, duration, intensity and interval between extreme climatic events put some sectors, such as agriculture and tourism, at particular risk in the Mediterranean region (Section CCP4.3; Kallis, 2008; Kutiel, 2019).
