For the Mediterranean Basin, all currently projected pathways of climate change will exacerbate climate-related risks in multiple systems and economic sectors, and for human health and well-being, amplifying current pressures on local ecosystems, economies and human well-being (Figures CCP4.7; CCP4.8; Cramer et al., 2018; MedECC, 2020). While the majority of these risks apply across the entire region, many are specific for certain sub-regions or locations.Figure CCP4.7 | Key risks in the Mediterranean and their location across the Mediterranean region for SSP5-RCP8. 5 by 2100 (Sections CCP4.3.2 –6; Table SMCCP4.2a and b for details). Risks to World Cultural Heritage sites from flooding or erosion due to sea level rise in multiple locations (Section CCP4.3.5) and Mediterranean river deltas are hotspots of vulnerability to climate change (Section CCP4.3.2). The population exposed to risks is mapped for an SSP5-8.5 pathway. Adaptation can reduce these risks (Section CCP4.4) (based on: Reimann et al., 2018a; 2018b; Wolff et al., 2018).Open figure Figure CCP4.8 | Summary of key risks for the Mediterranean (Sections CCP4. 3.2–8; Table SMCCP4.2a–h for details). Coastal risks include one burning ember displaying additional risks due to climate change as specific GWL are exceeded (Coastal risks), and one burning ember describing additional risks due to committed sea level rise at timescales of centuries and millennia for long-living infrastructure and cultural heritage (WGI AR6 Chapter 9, Fox-Kemper et al., 2021; Marzeion et al., 2014; Marzeion and Levermann, 2014; Clark et al., 2016; see SMCCP4.2h).Open figure
