Sea level rise is the origin of multiple risks for low-lying areas in the Mediterranean Basin; for example, the further increase in flooding at high tide in some locations, such as Venice (high confidence) (Chapter 13; Cid et al., 2016; Pomaro et al., 2017). Currently, 37% of coastal areas are at moderate to high risk from coastal erosion and flooding (Satta et al., 2017). Due to rapid urban development, many coastal assets are directly exposed to projected sea level rise and coastal hazards, with limited adaptation options and resilience of beaches (Section CCP4.2;Brown et al., 2016; Jiménez et al., 2017).The Mediterranean is a micro-tidal sea, where storms may hit the coast over several hours or longer, and not only during high tides (Le Cozannet et al., 2015; Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2016; Sierra et al., 2016; Sayol and Marcos, 2018). Projected changes of winds, storms and waves are small, and confidence in these changes is limited by the quality of climate models applied to the Mediterranean (Calafat et al., 2014; Androulidakis et al., 2015; Vousdoukas et al., 2017). Overall, sea level rise is projected to increase the risk of coastal flooding despite the potential slight reductions of marine storms (high confidence) (Lionello et al., 2017; Vousdoukas et al., 2017). Risks of erosion and flooding will be amplified with climate change, particularly in river deltas (Figure CCP4.6; Ali and El-Magd, 2016), on low-lying floodplains, on sandy beaches around the basin and in many coastal cities (Satta et al., 2017). Impacts are projected to increase nonlinearly during the 21st century with higher sea level rise, because coastal flooding will progressively change from overtopping to overflow, high-tide flooding and ultimately permanent flooding and shoreline retreat (high confidence) (Le Cozannet et al., 2015; Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2016; Sierra et al., 2016; Antonioli et al., 2017; Anzidei et al., 2017; Ciro Aucelli et al., 2017; Enríquez et al., 2017; Jiménez et al., 2017; Sayol and Marcos, 2018). These risks may be amplified further in areas with poor storm water management and sealed urban surfaces (Llasat et al., 2013; Gaume et al., 2016).Combined with storm surges, sea level rise may disrupt Mediterranean port operations (Sánchez-Arcilla et al., 2016; Sierra et al., 2016), with risks depending on adaptation, physical protection measures and basin depth. Risks for deep ports are more limited (Sierra et al., 2017), while low-depth small harbours, common in the Mediterranean, could be significantly affected (Sierra et al., 2016). Sea level rise may enhance sandy beach erosion and thereby impact recreation and tourism (Bitan and Zviely, 2018; Rizzetto, 2020), magnifying coastal degradation and pollution (Enríquez et al., 2017; Gössling et al., 2018).
