Slow-onset climate and ocean changes, and changes in extreme events, are expected to cause and/or to amplify nine KRs in small islands, through both direct (e.g., decrease in rainfall will increase water insecurity) and indirect, that is, cascading effects: For example, loss of terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services will increase water insecurity, which will in turn cause the degradation of human health and well-being (Figure 15.5, Table 15.6 and SM16).Table 15.6 | Adaptation options per key risk in small islands. This table summarises risk-oriented adaptation options, their level of implementation, enablers and effectiveness in reducing exposure and vulnerability, co-benefits and disbenefits in small islands. For KR2 (submergence of reef islands), not included, adaptation options are the same as for KR5.Key risksRisk-oriented adaptation optionsEvidence and agreementImplementationKey enablersReduction of exposure and vulnerabilityCo-benefitsDisbenefitsKR1.

Habitability is understood as the ability of these islands to support human life by providing protection from hazards which challenge human survival; by assuring adequate space, food and freshwater; and by providing economic opportunities, which contribute to health and well-being—recognising that both supportive ecosystems and sociocultural conditions (i.e., beliefs and values, institutions and governance arrangements, sense of community and attachment to place) play a critical role in habitability (Duvat et al., 2021a). The reduction of island habitability is expected to cause increased migration, along the afore-mentioned involuntary displacement to planned resettlement spectrum (Section 15.3.4.6), which may eventually lead to population movements from exposed areas and depopulation of some islands. This risk is the highest for atoll nations, where some islands might become uninhabitable over this century (Section 15.3.4.6; Storlazzi et al., 2018; Duvat et al., 2021a). Despite a lack of literature assessing the risk of reduced habitability in non-atoll islands, the latter are also expected to experience decreased habitability, especially in their coastal areas.
