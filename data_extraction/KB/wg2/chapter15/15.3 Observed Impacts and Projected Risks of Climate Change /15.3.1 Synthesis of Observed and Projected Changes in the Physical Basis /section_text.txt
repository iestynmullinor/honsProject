There is increased evidence of warming in the small islands, particularly in the latter half of the 20th century (high confidence). The diversity of metrics and timescales used across studies makes it impossible to provide explicit comparisons; however, Table 15.1 provides a summary of observed changes.Table 15.1 | Observed changes in basic climate metrics.PhenomenonLocationBasic trendsSpecific metricTime periodReference literatureAir tempWest PacificWarmerIncrease in daily mean minimum temp by 0.14°C per decade1951–2015McGree et al.

(2019)Notes:RSLR: relative sea-level riseSome phenomena have no demonstrable trends in a region because of limited observed data, these include TC frequency in the northeastern Pacific and Indian oceans (Walsh et al., 2016); other phenomena are too variable to detect an overarching trend, including rainfall in regions where inter-annual and decadal variabilities such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Variability, Atlantic Multidecadal Variability are dominant (Jones et al., 2015; McGree et al., 2019).There are also marked regional variations in the rates of SLR (Merrifield and Maltrud, 2011; Palanisamy et al., 2012; Esteban et al., 2019) and relative SLR (RSLR; that is, incorporating land movement). Various factors, including interannual and decadal sea level variations associated with low-frequency modulation of ENSO and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and vertical land motion contribute to both relative sea level variations and related uncertainties. Increased distant-source swell height from extra-tropical cyclones (ETCs) also contributes to ESLs (Mentaschi et al., 2017; Vitousek et al., 2017). Together, these stressors increase ESLs and their impacts, including coastal erosion and marine flooding and their impacts on both ecosystems and ecosystem services and human activities (Section 15.3.3.1 and Table 15.3).Table 15.2 | A small subset of projected changes in basic climate metric.

(2019)Like observed impacts, projected impacts include some high confidence assessments, which are distributed across a diversity of models, timescales and metrics. Generalised trends, and specific projections when available, are provided in Table 15.2. However, actual values and spatial distribution of precipitation changes remain uncertain as they are strongly model dependent (Paeth et al., 2017). Furthermore, the current capabilities of climate models, to adequately represent variability in climate drivers including ENSO, and the topography of small islands limit confidence  in these future changes (Cai et al., 2015a; Harter et al., 2015; Guilyardi et al., 2016).Table 15.3 | Percentage of selected islands classified as refugia for biodiversity at increasing levels of warming. While protected land is still ‘protected’ this table demonstrates the difficulty of protecting lands which might be ‘more resilient’ to climate change under increasing levels of warming and current land use practices. Derived from current and future projected distributions of ~130,000 terrestrial fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates (Warren et al., 2018a). Refugia=areas remaining climatically suitable for >75% of the species modelled (Warren et al., 2018b). Projections:  based on mean impacts from 21 CMIP5 climate model patterns (no dispersal) and elevationally downscaled to 1 km under interpolated warming levels derived from RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.0 (Warren et al., 2018a). First column-set: % island/island chain classified as a refugia based on climate alone; second column-set: % natural land projected to be climate refugia—illustrating potential refugia ‘space’ already lost to habitat conversion.
