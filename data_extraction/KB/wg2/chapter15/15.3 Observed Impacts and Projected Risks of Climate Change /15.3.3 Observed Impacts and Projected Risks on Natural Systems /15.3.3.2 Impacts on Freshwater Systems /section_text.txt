Freshwater systems on small islands are exposed to dynamic climate impacts and are considered to be among the most threatened on the planet (key risk 3 in Box 15.1; Settele et al., 2014; IPCC, 2018; Butchart et al., 2019). Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2019) estimated that freshwater stress on small islands would be 25% less with a warming of 1.5°C or less as compared to 2.0°C. While some island regions are projected to experience substantial freshwater decline, an opposite trend is observed for some western Pacific and northern Indian Ocean islands (Holding et al., 2016; Karnauskas et al., 2016). Island topography and ecophysiology influence water storage capacity and rainfall response potential (Dunn et al., 2018). On high volcanic and granitic islands, freshwater ecosystems are often closely connected with coastal spaces, and changes in freshwater supply from river systems have direct implications for salinity and sediment loads (high confidence) (Yang et al., 2015; Zahid et al., 2018). Climate impacts on streamflow patterns in tropical islands also create shifts in water supply for downstream users and habitat conditions for organisms supporting a wide range of ecosystem services (high confidence) (Strauch et al., 2015; Frazier and Brewington, 2019; Frauendorf et al., 2020).Projected changes in aridity are expected to impose freshwater stress on many small islands, especially SIDS (high confidence).These changes are congruent with drought risk projections for Caribbean SIDS (Lehner et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2018) and aligned with observations from the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2 scenario, where a 1°C increase in temperature (from 1.7°C to 2.7°C) could result in a 60% increase in the number of people projected to experience severe water resources stress from 2043 to 2071 (Schewe et al., 2014; Karnauskas et al., 2018). In the Mediterranean region, freshwater resources will decline by 10–30% (medium confidence)  (Koutroulis et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2020). For example, analysis of annual and seasonal streamflow data on the island of Mallorca shows a decreasing trend during spring and summer, with a reduction of up to 17% in some basins (Garcia, 2017).The influence of climate change spans several variables for atoll islands with multiple, interacting forces that exacerbate impacts on freshwater ecosystems (Connell, 2016), including groundwater and freshwater resources (Warix et al., 2017). Analysis of groundwater resources on Roi-Namur, in the Marshall Islands, reveals that the extent of salinisation of fresh groundwater lenses varies with the scale of the overwash (Gingerich et al., 2017). Alsumaiei and Bailey (2018) estimated an 11–36% reduction in the fresh groundwater lens volume of the small atoll islands (area < 0.6 km²) of the Maldives due to SLR. Small overwash events lead to saline conditions that last for up to 3 months (Oberle et al., 2017).SLR undermines the long-term persistence of freshwater-dependent ecosystems on islands (Goodman et al., 2012) and is one of the greatest threats to the goods and services these environments provide (Box 16.1; Mitsch and Hernandez, 2013). Hoegh-Guldberg et al. (2019) posit that as sea level rises, managing the risk of salinisation of freshwater resources will become increasingly important. On Roi-Namur, Marshall Islands, Storlazzi et al. (2018) found that the availability of freshwater is impacted by the compounding effect of SLR and coastal flooding. In other Pacific atolls, Terry and Chui (2012) showed that freshwater resources could be significantly affected by a 0.40-m SLR. Similar impacts are anticipated for some Caribbean countries (Stennett-Brown et al., 2017). Such changes in SLR could increase salinity in estuarine and aquifer water, affecting ground and surface water resources for drinking and irrigation water (Mycoo, 2018a) across the region (high confidence). SLR also affects groundwater quality (Bailey et al., 2016), salinity (Gingerich et al., 2017) and water-table height (Masterson et al., 2014).
